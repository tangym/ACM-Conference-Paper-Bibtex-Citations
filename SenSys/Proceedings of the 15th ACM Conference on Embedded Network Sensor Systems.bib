 abstract = {The ability to fine-tune communication performance is key to meeting the requirements of Internet of Things applications. While years of low-power wireless research now allows developers to fully optimize the performance of applications built on top of IEEE 802.15.4, this has not yet happened with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), whose networking performance is still largely unexplored and whose potential is not yet fully exploited. Indeed, BLE radios are often treated as a black box, because they are meant to only execute data transfer commands and manufacturers build BLE soft devices with closed-source network stacks. As a result, developers working with BLE cannot modify the radio driver or the link-layer, and hence have no direct control over radio duty cycling and packet re-transmissions. To tackle these challenges, we analyze and model how specific BLE features can be used to fine-tune communication performance at run-time. We further present the design and implementation of BLEach, an IPv6-over-BLE stack that exposes tuning knobs for controlling the energy usage and timeliness of BLE transmissions and that allows to enforce a variety of quality-of-service (QoS) metrics. We design three exemplary modules for BLEach providing novel BLE functionality: adaptive radio duty cycling, IPv6-over-BLE traffic prioritization and multiplexing, as well as indirect link-quality monitoring. We integrate BLEach into Contiki and release its code, thus addressing the lack of a full-fledged open-source IPv6-over-BLE stack. Experiments demonstrate that BLEach is lightweight, interoperable with other standard-compliant devices, and reduces energy costs by up to 50 % while giving QoS guarantees by quickly adapting to changes in interference, traffic priority, and traffic load.},

This naturally facilitates data sharing with third-party services and other users, but bears privacy risks, due to data breaches or unauthorized trades with user data. To address these concerns, we present Pilatus, a data protection platform where the cloud stores only encrypted data, yet is still able to process certain queries (e.g., range, sum). More importantly, Pilatus features a novel encrypted data sharing scheme based on re-encryption, with revocation capabilities and in situ key-update. Our solution includes a suite of novel techniques that enable efficient partially homomorphic encryption, decryption, and sharing. We present performance optimizations that render these cryptographic tools practical for mobile platforms. We implement a prototype of Pilatus and evaluate it thoroughly. Our optimizations achieve a performance gain within one order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art realizations; mobile devices can decrypt hundreds of data points in a few hundred milliseconds. Moreover, we discuss practical considerations through two example mobile applications (Fitbit and Ava) that run Pilatus on real-world data.},

 abstract = {Current COTS WiFi based work on wireless motion sensing extracts human movements such as keystroking and hand motion mainly from amplitude training to classify different types of motions, as obtaining meaningful phase values is very challenging due to time-varying phase noises occurred with the movement. However, the methods based only on amplitude training are not very practical since their accuracy is not environment and location independent. This paper proposes an effective phase noise calibration technique which can be broadly applicable to COTS WiFi based motion sensing. We leverage the fact that multi-path for indoor environment contains certain static paths, such as reflections from wall or static furniture, as well as dynamic paths due to human hand and arm movements. When a hand moves, the phase value of the signal from the hand rotates as the path length changes and causes the superposition of signals over static and dynamic paths in antenna and frequency domain. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we experiment with a prototype system that can track hand gestures in a non-intrusive manner, i.e. users are not equipped with any device, using COTS WiFi devices. Our evaluation shows that calibrated phase values provide much rich, yet robust information on motion tracking -- 80th percentile angle estimation error up to 14 degrees, 80th percentile tracking error up to 15 cm, and its robustness to the environment and the speed of movement.},

In this paper, we address trustworthy operations of next generation CPSs. Our idea is inspired by a trustworthy computing framework known as Proof-Carrying Code, in which foreign executables carry a model to prove that they have not been tampered with and they function as expected. In our context, we leverage the physical world--a channel that encapsulates properties impossible to tamper with remotely, such as proximity and causality--to create a challenge-response function. We call it Proof-Carrying Sensing and use it to help authenticate devices, collected data, and locations. A unique advantage of this approach, vis-à-vis traditional multi-factor or out-of-band authentication mechanisms, is that authentication proofs are embedded in sensor data and can be continuously validated over time and space without resorting to complicated cryptographic algorithms. This, in turn, makes it fit particularly well to CPSs where mobility and resource constraints are common.},

Using data collected from 76 buildings in a university campus, we study the feasibility of multi-modal fusion between the three data sources for estimating fine-grained occupancy. In order to make the estimation model scalable, we propose three different clustering schemes to identify similarity in building characteristics and training per-cluster occupancy estimation models. The presented multi-modal fusion estimation framework achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 13.22% and we find that leveraging all three modalities provide an improvement of 48% in accuracy as compared to WiFi-only occupancy estimation. Our evaluation also shows that clustering buildings greatly increases the scalability of the proposed approach through significant reduction in training overhead, while providing an accuracy comparable to exhaustive, per-building estimation models.},

 abstract = {Mobile and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, such as smartphones, tablets, wearables, smart home assistants (e.g., Google Home and Amazon Echo), and wall-mounted cameras, come equipped with various sensors, notably camera and microphone. These sensors can capture extremely sensitive and private information. There are several important scenarios where, for privacy reasons, a user might require assurance about the use (or non-use) of these sensors. For example, the owner of a home assistant might require assurance that the microphone on the device is not used during a given time of the day. Similarly, during a confidential meeting, the host needs assurance that attendees do not record any audio or video. Currently, there are no means to attain such assurance in modern mobile and IoT devices. To this end, this paper presents Ditio, a system approach for auditing sensor activities. Ditio records sensor activity logs that can be later inspected by an auditor and checked for compliance with a given policy. It is based on a hybrid security monitor architecture that leverages both ARM's virtualization hardware and TrustZone. Ditio includes an authentication protocol for establishing a logging session with a trusted server and a formally verified companion tool for log analysis. Ditio prototypes on ARM Juno development board and Nexus 5 smartphone show that it introduces negligible performance overhead for both the camera and microphone. However, it incurs up to 17% additional power consumption under heavy use for the Nexus 5 camera.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case for some devices equipped with backscatter radios. We present LOREA an architecture consisting of a tag, a reader and multiple carrier generators that overcomes the power, cost and range limitations of existing systems such as Computational Radio Frequency Identification (CRFID). LOREA achieves this by: First, generating narrow-band backscatter transmissions that improve receiver sensitivity. Second, mitigating self-interference without the complex designs employed on RFID readers by keeping carrier signal and backscattered signal apart in frequency. Finally, decoupling carrier generation from the reader and using devices such as WiFi routers and sensor nodes as a source of the carrier signal. An off-the-shelf implementation of LOREA costs 70 USD, a drastic reduction in price considering commercial RFID readers cost 2000 USD. LOREA's range scales with the carrier strength, and proximity to the carrier source and achieves a maximum range of 3.4 km when the tag is located at 1 m distance from a 28 dBm carrier source while consuming 70 μW at the tag. When the tag is equidistant from the carrier source and the receiver, we can communicate upto 75 m, a significant improvement over existing RFID readers.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning based data analytics are opening opportunities for designing effective clinical decision support systems (CDSS) which can become the "third-eye" in the current clinical procedures and diagnosis. However, common patient movements in hospital wards may lead to faulty measurements in physiological sensor readings, and training a CDSS from such noisy data can cause misleading predictions, directly leading to potentially dangerous clinical decisions. In this work, we present MediSense, a system to sense, classify, and identify noise-causing motions and activities that affect physiological signal when made by patients on their hospital beds. Essentially, such a system can be considered as "glasses" for the clinical third eye in correctly observing medical data. MediSense combines wirelessly connected embedded platforms for motion detection with physiological signal data collected from patients to identify faulty physiological signal measurements and filters such noisy data from being used in CDSS training or testing datasets. We deploy our system in real intensive care units (ICUs), and evaluate its performance from real patient traces collected at these ICUs through a 4-month pilot study at the Ajou University Hospital Trauma Center, a major hospital facility located in Suwon, South Korea. Our results show that MediSense successfully classifies patient motions on the bed with >90% accuracy, shows 100% reliability in determining the locations of beds within the ICU, and each bed-attached sensor achieves a lifetime of more than 33 days, which satisfies the application-level requirements suggested by our clinical partners. Furthermore, a simple case-study with arrhythmia patient data shows that MediSense can help improve the clinical diagnosis accuracy.},

 abstract = {There is an undeniable communication barrier between deaf people and people with normal hearing ability. Although innovations in sign language translation technology aim to tear down this communication barrier, the majority of existing sign language translation systems are either intrusive or constrained by resolution or ambient lighting conditions. Moreover, these existing systems can only perform single-sign ASL translation rather than sentence-level translation, making them much less useful in daily-life communication scenarios. In this work, we fill this critical gap by presenting DeepASL, a transformative deep learning-based sign language translation technology that enables ubiquitous and non-intrusive American Sign Language (ASL) translation at both word and sentence levels. DeepASL uses infrared light as its sensing mechanism to non-intrusively capture the ASL signs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical bidirectional deep recurrent neural network (HB-RNN) and a probabilistic framework based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for word-level and sentence-level ASL translation respectively. To evaluate its performance, we have collected 7, 306 samples from 11 participants, covering 56 commonly used ASL words and 100 ASL sentences. DeepASL achieves an average 94.5% word-level translation accuracy and an average 8.2% word error rate on translating unseen ASL sentences. Given its promising performance, we believe DeepASL represents a significant step towards breaking the communication barrier between deaf people and hearing majority, and thus has the significant potential to fundamentally change deaf people's lives.},

The Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) are tasked with detecting and eliminating such water collection areas. However, they face the problem of detecting potential breeding sites in hard-to-reach areas. With the technological development, the drones come as one of the most cost effective unmanned vehicles to access the places that a man cannot access. This paper presents a novel approach for identifying mosquito breeding areas via drone images through the distinct coloration of those areas by applying the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm. Using the HOG algorithm, we detect potential water retention areas using drone images.},

Sensor tags for such deployments need long lifetimes and incorporate multiple sensors, especially location because space use can contextualize behavior. The tag size needs to be minimal so as not to affect the activities of the animal. Aquatic animals in particular present challenges due to lack of wireless communication and water-proofing. Taking these points into consideration we have designed Aquamote: an ultra-low power, tiny sensor tag (20 x 29 mm2) which integrates accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, depth sensor, GPS and BLE. Our poster will showcase the performance of AquaMote and highlight our design decisions to reduce its size and power consumption.},

 abstract = {Tiny intermittently powered computers can monitor objects in hard to reach places maintenance free for decades by leaving batteries behind and surviving off energy harvested from the environment--- avoiding the cost of replacing and disposing of billions or trillions of dead batteries. However, creating programs for these sensors is difficult. Energy harvesting is inconsistent, energy storage is scarce, and batteryless sensors can lose power at any point in time--- causing volatile memory, execution progress, and time to reset. In response to these disruptions, developers must write unwieldy programs attempting to protect against failures, instead of focusing on sensing goals, defining tasks, and generating useful data in a timely manner. To address these shortcomings, we have designed Mayfly, a language and runtime for timely execution of sensing tasks on tiny, intermittently-powered, energy harvesting sensing devices. Mayfly is a coordination language and runtime built on top of Embedded-C that combines intermittent execution fragments to form coherent sensing schedules---maintaining forward progress, data consistency, data freshness, and data utility across multiple power failures. Mayfly makes the passing of time explicit, binding data to the time it was gathered, and keeping track of data and time through power failures. We evaluated Mayfly against state-of-the art systems, conducted a user study, and implemented multiple real world applications across application domains in inventory tracking, and wearables.},

 abstract = {Extending battery lifetime is an important issue for mobile devices. While extensive attempts have been made at the software level, optimization often risks hampering user experience. One fundamental method to increase battery lifetime is to improve the efficiency of the battery itself. We argue that the multi-cell battery system, which is widely used for enhancing battery efficiency in the electric vehicle (EV) field, can solve this issue. However, due to the hardware constraints and device usage characteristics, battery advancements in the EV field are not directly applicable to mobile devices. In this paper, we propose BattMan, a multi-cell battery management system for mobile devices, for the enhancement of battery efficiency. We develop an accurate battery cell model to estimate the expected battery lifetime considering the recovery effect, the rate capacity effect, and battery aging. We also propose a multi-cell scheduling algorithm to maximize the overall battery lifetime. We implemented BattMan on recent smartphones and evaluated its impact on battery lifetime. The experimental results show that a two-cell configuration of the proposed system increases battery lifetime by an average of between 14-19%, depending on cell aging, in real usage scenarios over a single-cell battery of the same overall capacity. We hope the proposed multi-cell battery scheme opens up a new direction towards battery lifetime improvement in mobile devices.},

Distributed consensus protocols is a mature field of research in a wired context, but has received little attention in low-power wireless settings. In this paper, we present A2: Agreement in the Air, a system that brings distributed consensus to low-power multi-hop networks. A2 introduces Synchrotron, a synchronous transmissions kernel that builds a robust mesh by exploiting the capture effect, frequency hopping with parallel channels, and link-layer security. A2 builds on top of this reliable base layer and enables the two- and three-phase commit protocols, as well as network services such as group membership, hopping sequence distribution and re-keying. We evaluate A2 on four public testbeds with different deployment densities and sizes. A2 requires only 475 ms to complete a two-phase commit over 180 nodes. The resulting duty cycle is 0.5% for 1-minute intervals. We show that A2 achieves zero losses end-to-end over long experiments, representing millions of data points. When adding controlled failures, we show that two-phase commit ensures transaction consistency in A2 while three-phase commit provides liveness at the expense of inconsistency under specific failure scenarios.},

Traditional approaches are limited due to their high deployment costs and privacy concerns (e.g., camera-based surveillance or sensor-attachment-based solutions). In this work, we propose to provide a fine-grained comprehensive view of human dynamics using existing WiFi infrastructures often available in many indoor venues. Our approach is low-cost and device-free, which does not require any active human participation. Our system aims to provide smart human dynamics monitoring through participant number estimation, human density estimation and walking speed and direction derivation. A semi-supervised learning approach leveraging the non-linear regression model is developed to significantly reduce training efforts and accommodate different monitoring environments. We further derive participant number and density estimation based on the statistical distribution of Channel State Information (CSI) measurements. In addition, people's walking speed and direction are estimated by using a frequency-based mechanism. Extensive experiments over 12 months demonstrate that our system can perform fine-grained effective human dynamic monitoring with over 90% accuracy in estimating participants number, density, and walking speed and direction at various indoor environments.},

Recently proposed Sensor Network over White Spaces (SNOW) technology is particularly attractive due to the availability and advantages of TV spectrum in long-range communication. This paper proposes a new design of SNOW that is asynchronous, reliable, and robust. It represents the first highly scalable LPWAN over TV white spaces to support reliable, asynchronous, bi-directional, and concurrent communication between numerous sensors and a base station. This is achieved through a set of novel techniques. This new design of SNOW has an OFDM based physical layer that adopts robust modulation scheme and allows the base station using a single antenna-radio (1) to send different data to different nodes concurrently and (2) to receive concurrent transmissions made by the sensor nodes asynchronously. It has a lightweight MAC protocol that (1) efficiently implements per-transmission acknowledgments of the asynchronous transmissions by exploiting the adopted OFDM design; (2) combines CSMA/CA and location-aware spectrum allocation for mitigating hidden terminal effects, thus enhancing the flexibility of the nodes in transmitting asynchronously. Hardware experiments through deployments in three radio environments - in a large metropolitan city, in a rural area, and in an indoor environment - as well as large-scale simulations demonstrated that the new SNOW design drastically outperforms other LPWAN technologies in terms of scalability, energy, and latency.},

Batteries are the single greatest threat to this vision of a sustainable Internet of Things. They are expensive, bulky, hazardous, and wear out after a few years (even rechargeables). Replacing and disposing of billions or trillions of dead batteries per year would be expensive and irresponsible. By leaving the batteries behind and surviving off energy harvested from the environment, tiny intermittently powered computers can monitor objects in hard to reach places maintenance free for decades. The intermittent execution, constrained compute and energy resources, and unreliability of these devices creates new challenges for the sensing and embedded systems community. However, the rewards and potential impact across many fields are worth it, enabling currently impractical applications in health services and patient care, commercial and consumer applications, wildlife conservation, industrial and infrastructure management, even space exploration.

Computation and communication in such materials are based on miniature, possibly wireless, devices that are scattered in the material and interface with sensors and actuators inside the material.

 abstract = {IoT devices usually are battery-powered and directly connected to the Internet. This makes them vulnerable to so-called path-based denial-of-service (PDoS) attacks. For example, in a PDoS attack an adversary sends multiple Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) messages towards an IoT device, thereby causing each IoT device along the path to expend energy for forwarding this message. Current end-to-end security solutions, such as DTLS or IPsec, fail to prevent such attacks since they only filter out inauthentic CoAP messages at their destination. This demonstration shows an approach to allow en-route filtering where a trusted gateway has all necessary information to check the integrity, decrypt and, if necessary, drop a message before forwarding it to the constrained mote. Our approach preserves precious resources of IoT devices in the face of path-based denial-of-service attacks by remote attackers.},

Under this scheme, the eNodeB allocates subchannels for in-coverage vehicles. Then, vehicles will broadcast directly without the eNodeB intervening in the process. Therefore, in each communications cluster, it will become crucial to prevent allocation conflicts in time domain since vehicles will not be able to transmit and receive simultaneously. We present a solution where the time-domain requirement can be enforced through vertex aggregation. Additionally, allocation of subchannels is performed sequentially from the most to the least allocation-constrained cluster.

 abstract = {The development and validation studies of new multisensory biomarkers and sensor-triggered interventions requires collecting raw sensor data with associated labels in the natural field environment. Unlike platforms for traditional mHealth apps, a software platform for such studies needs to not only support high-rate data ingestion, but also share raw high-rate sensor data with researchers, while supporting high-rate sense-analyze-act functionality in real-time. We present mCerebrum, a realization of such a platform, which supports high-rate data collections from multiple sensors with realtime assessment of data quality. A scalable storage architecture (with near optimal performance) ensures quick response despite rapidly growing data volume. Micro-batching and efficient sharing of data among multiple source and sink apps allows reuse of computations to enable real-time computation of multiple biomarkers without saturating the CPU or memory. Finally, it has a reconfigurable scheduler which manages all prompts to participants that is burden- and context-aware. With a modular design currently spanning 23+ apps, mCerebrum provides a comprehensive ecosystem of system services and utility apps. The design of mCerebrum has evolved during its concurrent use in scientific field studies at ten sites spanning 106,806 person days. Evaluations show that compared with other platforms, mCerebrum's architecture and design choices support 1.5 times higher data rates and 4.3 times higher storage throughput, while causing 8.4 times lower CPU usage.},

 abstract = {Accurately measuring and monitoring patient's blood oxygen level plays a critical role in today's clinical diagnosis and healthcare practices. Existing techniques however either require a dedicated hardware or produce inaccurate measurements. To fill in this gap, we propose a phone-based oxygen level estimation system, called PhO2, using camera and flashlight functions that are readily available on today's off-the-shelf smart phones. Since phone's camera and flashlight are not made for this purpose, utilizing them for oxygen level estimation poses many challenges. We introduce a cost-effective add-on together with a set of algorithms for spatial and spectral optical signal modulation to amplify the optical signal of interest while minimizing noise. A light-based pressure detection algorithm and feedback mechanism are also proposed to mitigate the negative impacts of user's behavior during the measurement. We also derive a non-linear referencing model that allows PhO2 to estimate the oxygen level from color intensity ratios produced by smartphone's camera. An evaluation using a custom-built optical element on COTS smartphone with 6 subjects shows that PhO2 can estimate the oxygen saturation within 3.5% error rate comparing to FDA-approved gold standard pulse oximetry. A user study to gauge the reception of PhO2 shows that users are comfortable self-operating the device, and willing to carry the device when going out.},

Then the constructed network maps all the nodes' GPS raw measurements to a lead node's view, to determine an accurate GPS location for each node. Experiment results show that BikeNet improves the localization accuracy by 2.96x and 4.8x, compared with the classic GPS method.},

 abstract = {Using geophones to sense bed vibrations caused by ballistic force has shown great potential in monitoring a person's heart rate during sleep. It does not require a special mattress or sheets, and the user is free to move around and change position during sleep. Earlier work has studied how to process the geophone signal to detect heartbeats when a single subject occupies the entire bed. In this study, we develop a system called VitalMon, aiming to monitor a person's respiratory rate as well as heart rate, even when she is sharing a bed with another person. In such situations, the vibrations from both persons are mixed together. VitalMon first separates the two heartbeat signals, and then distinguishes the respiration signal from the heartbeat signal for each person. Our heartbeat separation algorithm relies on the spatial difference between two signal sources with respect to each vibration sensor, and our respiration extraction algorithm deciphers the breathing rate embedded in amplitude fluctuation of the heartbeat signal. We have developed a prototype bed to evaluate the proposed algorithms. A total of 86 subjects participated in our study, and we collected 5084 geophone samples, totaling 56 hours of data. We show that our technique is accurate -- its breathing rate estimation error for a single person is 0.38 breaths per minute (median error is 0.22 breaths per minute), heart rate estimation error when two persons share a bed is 1.90 beats per minute (median error is 0.72 beats per minute), and breathing rate estimation error when two persons share a bed is 2.62 breaths per minute (median error is 1.95 breaths per minute). By varying sleeping posture and mattress type, we show that our system can work in many different scenarios.},

 abstract = {Continuous tracking of the device location in 3D space is a popular form of user input, especially for virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), video games and health rehabilitation. Conventional inertial based approaches are well known for inaccuracy caused by large error drifts. Computer vision approaches can produce accuracy tracking but have privacy concerns and are subject to lighting conditions and computation complexity. Recent work exploits accurate acoustic distance measurements for high precision tracking. However, they require additional hardware (e.g., multiple external speakers), which adds to the costs and installation efforts, thus limiting the convenience and usability. In this paper, we propose BatTracker, which incorporates inertial and acoustic data for robust, high precision and infrastructure-free tracking in indoor environments. BatTracker leverages echoes from nearby objects and uses distance measurements from them to correct error accumulation in inertial based device position prediction. It incorporates Doppler shifts and echo amplitudes to reliably identify the association between echoes and objects despite noisy signals from multi-path reflection and cluttered environment. A probabilistic algorithm creates, prunes and evolves multiple hypotheses based on measurement evidences to accommodate uncertainty in device position. Experiments in real environments show that BatTracker can track a mobile device's movements in 3D space at sub-cm level accuracy, comparable to the state-of-the-art infrastructure based approaches, while eliminating the needs of any additional hardware.},

 abstract = {Many existing indoor localization systems have achieved applaudable performance through comprehensive modeling of its envisioned working scenario. However their real life deployment are often prohibited by high deployment overhead and performance degradation in dynamic environments. This paper presents SmartLight, a 3D digital indoor localization system based on LED lighting infrastructures. It adopts a novel design philosophy of shifting all the complexity into modifying a single LED lamp and maintaining minimum complexity on the receiver to reduce the hassle on system deployment/calibration. With a single modified LED lamp, the system is capable of localizing a large number of light sensors in a room. The underlying technique is to exploit the light splitting properties of convex lens to create an one-to-one mapping between a location and the set of orthogonal digital light signals receivable at that location. Advanced designs are also introduced to further improve the system accuracy and scalability beyond the hardware capability. In evaluating the design, we build an experimental prototype with a 60hz projector, achieving average localization around 10cm and 90 percentile error of 50cm.},

 abstract = {We propose a novel method for mitigating erroneous wake-ups that are commonly associated with ultra-low power wake-up receivers. Recent research in low-power protocols has demonstrated significant improvements in energy-efficiency by employing ultra-low power wake-up receivers. However, due to the low-complexity receiver structures adopted, wake-up receivers are susceptible to external interference, which can cause the detection of non-existent wake-ups. The occurrence of these erroneous wake-ups wastes precious energy resources, thereby negating the potential energy savings in employing wake-up receivers. We address this challenging problem by extracting time-domain features from the output of the wake-up receiver, and construct a classifier to distinguish between correct and erroneous wake-ups. We describe the design of the proposed wake-up classifier and present preliminary results.},

A myriad of experimental works tackles the problems involved in the coexistence of different radio access technologies (RAT) in unlicensed spectrum, however, they do not cover all aspects of the problem and fail to provide the framework adopted in the experiments for reproducible research.

 abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning motivate the use of deep neutral networks in sensing applications, but their excessive resource needs on constrained embedded devices remain an important impediment. A recently explored solution space lies in compressing (approximating or simplifying) deep neural networks in some manner before use on the device. We propose a new compression solution, called DeepIoT, that makes two key contributions in that space. First, unlike current solutions geared for compressing specific types of neural networks, DeepIoT presents a unified approach that compresses all commonly used deep learning structures for sensing applications, including fully-connected, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks, as well as their combinations. Second, unlike solutions that either sparsify weight matrices or assume linear structure within weight matrices, DeepIoT compresses neural network structures into smaller dense matrices by finding the minimum number of non-redundant hidden elements, such as filters and dimensions required by each layer, while keeping the performance of sensing applications the same. Importantly, it does so using an approach that obtains a global view of parameter redundancies, which is shown to produce superior compression. The compressed model generated by DeepIoT can directly use existing deep learning libraries that run on embedded and mobile systems without further modifications. We conduct experiments with five different sensing-related tasks on Intel Edison devices. DeepIoT outperforms all compared baseline algorithms with respect to execution time and energy consumption by a significant margin. It reduces the size of deep neural networks by 90% to 98.9%. It is thus able to shorten execution time by 71.4% to 94.5%, and decrease energy consumption by 72.2% to 95.7%. These improvements are achieved without loss of accuracy. The results underscore the potential of DeepIoT for advancing the exploitation of deep neural networks on resource-constrained embedded devices.},

 abstract = {Design of clock synchronization for networked nodes faces a fundamental trade-off between synchronization accuracy and universality for heterogeneous platforms, because a high synchronization accuracy generally requires platform-dependent hardware-level network packet timestamping. This paper presents TouchSync, a new indoor clock synchronization approach for wearables that achieves millisecond accuracy while preserving universality in that it uses standard system calls only, such as reading system clock, sampling sensors, and sending/receiving network messages. The design of TouchSync is driven by a key finding from our extensive measurements that the skin electric potentials (SEPs) induced by powerline radiation are salient, periodic, and synchronous on a same wearer and even across different wearers. TouchSync integrates the SEP signal into the universal principle of Network Time Protocol and solves an integer ambiguity problem by fusing the ambiguous results in multiple synchronization rounds to conclude an accurate clock offset between two synchronizing wearables. With our shared code, TouchSync can be readily integrated into any wearable applications. Extensive evaluation based on our Arduino and TinyOS implementations shows that TouchSync's synchronization errors are below 3 and 7 milliseconds on the same wearer and between two wearers 10 kilometers apart, respectively.},

However, because camera permissions for existing mobile operating systems are coarse (i.e., an app may access a camera's entire view or none of it), users are vulnerable to visual privacy leaks. An app violates visual privacy if it extracts information from camera data in unexpected ways. For example, a user might be surprised to find that an augmented-reality makeup app extracts text from the camera's view in addition to detecting faces. This paper presents results from the first large-scale study of visual privacy leaks in the wild. We build CamForensics to identify the kind of information that apps extract from camera data. Our extensive user surveys determine what kind of information users expected an app to extract. Finally, our results show that camera apps frequently defy users' expectations based on their descriptions.},

 abstract = {Inkjet 3D printing is a disruptive manufacturing technology in emerging metal- and bio-printing applications. The nozzle of the printer deposits tiny liquid droplets, which are subsequently solidified on a target location. Due to the elegant concept of micro-droplet deposition, inkjet 3D printing is capable of achieving a sub-millimeter scale manufacturing resolution. However, the droplet deposition process is dynamic and uncertain which imposes a significant challenge on quality assurance of inkjet 3D printing in terms of product reproducibility and process repeatability. To this end, we present Luban as a certification tool to examine the printing quality in the inkjet printing process. Luban is a new low-cost and in-situ droplet micro-sensing system that can precisely detect, analyze and localize a droplet. Specifically, we present a novel tiny object sensing method by exploiting the computational light beam field and its sensitive interference effect. The realization of Luban is associated with two technical thrusts. First, we study integral sensing, i.e., a new scheme towards computational light beam field sensing, to efficiently extract droplet location information. This sensing scheme offers a new in-situ droplet sensing modality, which can promote the information acquisition efficiency and reduce the sensing cost compared to prior approaches. Second, we characterize interference effect of the computational light beam field and develop an efficient integration-domain droplet location estimation algorithm. We design and implement Luban in a real inkjet 3D printing system with commercially off-the-shelf devices, which costs less than a hundred dollars. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world evaluation show that Luban can reach the certification precision of a sub-millimeter scale with a 99% detection accuracy of defect droplets; furthermore, the enabled in-situ certification throughput is as high as over 700 droplets per second. Therefore, the performance of our Luban system can meet the quality assurance requirements (e.g., cost-effective, in-situ, high-accuracy and high-throughput) in general industrial applications.},

A successful city-scale deployment requires physical installation, power management, and communications---all challenging tasks standing between a good idea and a realized one, suggesting the need for a platform that enables easy deployment and experimentation of city-scale sensing applications. To address these basic challenges, we present Signpost, a modular platform for city-scale sensing. Signpost simplifies deployment and installation in cities by removing the need for connection to wired infrastructure and instead harvesting energy from an integrated solar panel. The platform provides the key resources necessary for its pluggable sensor modules to support city-scale applications.

 abstract = {IEEE 802.11ah is a new Wi-Fi standard operating on unlicensed sub-GHz frequencies. It aims to provide long-range connectivity to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The IEEE 802.11ah restricted access window (RAW) mechanism promises to increase throughput and energy efficiency in dense deployments by dividing stations into different RAW groups and allowing only one group to access the channel at a time. In this demo, we demonstrate the ability of the RAW mechanism to support a large number of densely deployed IoT stations with heterogeneous traffic requirements. Differentiated Quality of Service (QoS) is offered to a small set of high-throughput wireless cameras that coexist with thousands of best-effort sensor monitoring stations. The results are visualized in near real-time using our own developed IEEE 802.11ah visualizer running on top of the ns-3 event-based network simulator.},

 abstract = {Cross-Technology Communication is an emerging research direction providing a promising solution to the wireless coexistence problem in the ISM bands. However, the state-of-the-art CTC designs have intrinsic limitations in the throughput due to their use of coarse-grained packet-level information. In contrast, we propose to exploit the fine-grained signal modulation information via a technique called PHY-layer emulation to boost CTC throughput. We can embed a legitimate packet of a target technology, e.g., ZigBee, within the payload of a source technology, e.g., WiFi or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). At the mean time, we require no modification at the hardware or firmware at either sender or receiver. We can achieve 8,000x throughput from WiFi to ZigBee and 10,000x throughput from BLE to ZigBee compared to the state of the art. We also have a demo showcasing how our designs can be implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones for smart light bulbs control.},

Finally, by decoupling carrier generation from the reader and using devices such as WiFi routers and sensor nodes as a source of the carrier signal. LOREA's communication range scales with the carrier strength, and proximity to the carrier source and achieves a maximum range of 3.4km when the tag is located 1 m from the carrier source while consuming 70 μWs at the backscatter tag.

 abstract = {Tracking user's eye fixation direction is crucial to virtual reality (VR): it eases user's interaction with the virtual scene and enables intelligent rendering to improve user's visual experiences and save system energy. Existing techniques commonly rely on cameras and active infrared emitters, making them too expensive and power-hungry for VR headsets (especially mobile VR headsets). We present LiGaze, a low-cost, low-power approach to gaze tracking tailored to VR. It relies on a few low-cost photodiodes, eliminating the need for cameras and active infrared emitters. Reusing light emitted from the VR screen, LiGaze leverages photodiodes around a VR lens to measure reflected screen light in different directions. It then infers gaze direction by exploiting pupil's light absorption property. The core of LiGaze is to deal with screen light dynamics and extract changes in reflected light related to pupil movement. LiGaze infers a 3D gaze vector on the fly using a lightweight regression algorithm. We design and fabricate a LiGaze prototype using off-the-shelf photodiodes. Our comparison to a commercial VR eye tracker (FOVE) shows that LiGaze achieves 6.3° and 10.1° mean within-user and cross-user accuracy. Its sensing and computation consume 791μW in total and thus can be completely powered by a credit-card sized solar cell harvesting energy from indoor lighting. LiGaze's simplicity and ultra-low power make it applicable in a wide range of VR headsets to better unleash VR's potential.},

To obtain an accurate position information, the system makes use of a single anchor and of multipath reflections from walls, hence removing the need of installing a network of anchors or any other additional infrastructure. The procedure of determining the position of a tag can be divided in four consecutive stages. First, the location of virtual anchors is computed by mirroring the anchor position at reflective surfaces. Using two-way ranging, the distance and channel impulse response (CIR) between anchor and tag is obtained. This actual CIR is compared with expected CIRs from possible tag locations using a maximum likelihood approach to estimate the tag's position. Finally, a switchable directional antenna can be exploited to improve the robustness of the system by suppressing undesired, interfering multipath components. By following this procedure, the proposed system can achieve a decimeter accuracy and react to position updates in real-time.},

However, in many of those real-world scenarios, tracking or identifying people with facial recognition is extremely challenging due to the variations in the environment such as lighting conditions, camera viewing angles and subject motion. For most of the state-of-the-art face recognition systems, they need to be trained on a large dataset containing a good variety of labelled face images to work well. However, collecting and manually labelling such datasets is difficult and time consuming, probably more so than developing the algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically label user identities with their face images in smart spaces, exploiting the fact that the users tend to carry their smart devices while seen by the surveillance cameras. We evaluate our method on 10 users in a smart building setting, and the experimental results show that our method can achieve > 0.9 f1 score on average.},
