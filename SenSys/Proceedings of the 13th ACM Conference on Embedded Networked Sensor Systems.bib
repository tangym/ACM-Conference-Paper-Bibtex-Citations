 abstract = {According to the statistics, people upgrade smartphones at every two years, which means tremendous number of phones will be left unused. In this paper, we propose a method to use Android-based smartphones as wireless sensors for environmental monitoring. Although the idea of using smartphones as a wireless sensor sounds naive, the previous approaches were un-practical because of its limited battery life. In this paper, we exploit the Linux kernel boot mode on Android devices to extend the battery life drastically. Unlike normal mode, power consumption in the kernel mode is minimum but still it is possible to access to all the sensors in principle. In this paper, we measure the power consumption of Nexus5 while booting, running and shutting down Android OS / Linux kernel and estimate the battery life assuming a duty cycle. The results show that utilizing the Linux kernel can extend the battery life up to 10.9 times when the sensing interval is 3 minutes.},

 abstract = {The proliferation of Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) chipsets on mobile devices has lead to a wide variety of user-installable tags and beacons designed for location-aware applications. In this paper, we present the Acoustic Location Processing System (ALPS), a platform that augments BLE transmitters with ultrasound in a manner that improves ranging accuracy and can help users configure indoor localization systems with minimal effort. A user places three or more beacons in an environment and then walks through a calibration sequence with their mobile device where they touch key points in the environment like the floor and the corners of the room. This process automatically computes the room geometry as well as the precise beacon locations without needing auxiliary measurements. Once configured, the system can track a user's location referenced to a map. The platform consists of time-synchronized ultrasonic transmitters that utilize the bandwidth just above the human hearing limit, where mobile devices are still sensitive and can detect ranging signals. To aid in the mapping process, the beacons perform inter-beacon ranging during setup. Each beacon includes a BLE radio that can identify and trigger the ultrasonic signals. By using differences in propagation characteristics between ultrasound and radio, the system can classify if beacons are within Line-Of-Sight (LOS) to the mobile phone. In cases where beacons are blocked, we show how the phone's inertial measurement sensors can be used to supplement localization data. We experimentally evaluate that our system can estimate three-dimensional beacon location with a Euclidean distance error of 16.1cm, and can generate maps with room measurements with a two-dimensional Euclidean distance error of 19.8cm. When tested in six different environments, we saw that the system can identify Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signals with over 80% accuracy and track a user's location to within less than 100cm.},

 abstract = {With the popular usage of mobile devices and smartphones, crowd sensing becomes pervasive in real life when human acts as sensors to report their observations about entities. For the same entity, users may report conflicting information, and thus it is important to identify the true information and the reliable users. This task, referred to as truth discovery, has recently attracted much attention. Existing work typically assumes independence among entities. However, correlations among entities are commonly observed in many applications. Such correlation information is crucial in the truth discovery task. When entities are not observed by enough reliable users, it is impossible to obtain true information. In such cases, it is important to propagate trustworthy information from correlated entities that have been observed by reliable users. We formulate the task of truth discovery on correlated entities as an optimization problem in which both truths and user reliability are modeled as variables. The correlation among entities adds to the difficulty of solving this problem. In light of the challenge, we propose both sequential and parallel solutions. In the sequential solution, we partition entities into disjoint independent sets and derive iterative approaches based on block coordinate descent. In the parallel solution, we adapt the solution to MapReduce programming model, which can be executed on Hadoop clusters. Experiments on real-world crowd sensing applications show the advantages of the proposed method on discovering truths from conflicting information reported on correlated entities.},

Whereas prior studies have focused on outdoor/street parking, we target at (indoor) parking garages where the infrastructure supports (e.g., GPS and Wi-Fi) assumed by existing proposals are unavailable and counting vehicles by crowdsensing is difficult. To this end, we present ParkGauge as a system gauging the congestion level of parking garages; it infers (coarse-grained) parking occupancy from crowdsensed parking characteristics instead of counting the parked vehicles. ParkGauge adopts mostly low-power sensors in the driver's smartphone to determine driving states, contexts and temporal parking characteristics of a garage, including time-to-park and time-in-cruising/queuing. Mining such data collected from a crowd of drivers at various garages yields a good measure of their congestion levels and provide recommendations (in real-time) to drivers coming to these venues.},

 abstract = {Glimpse is a continuous, real-time object recognition system for camera-equipped mobile devices. Glimpse captures full-motion video, locates objects of interest, recognizes and labels them, and tracks them from frame to frame for the user. Because the algorithms for object recognition entail significant computation, Glimpse runs them on server machines. When the latency between the server and mobile device is higher than a frame-time, this approach lowers object recognition accuracy. To regain accuracy, Glimpse uses an active cache of video frames on the mobile device. A subset of the frames in the active cache are used to track objects on the mobile, using (stale) hints about objects that arrive from the server from time to time. To reduce network bandwidth usage, Glimpse computes trigger frames to send to the server for recognizing and labeling. Experiments with Android smartphones and Google Glass over Verizon, AT&T, and a campus Wi-Fi network show that with hardware face detection support (available on many mobile devices), Glimpse achieves precision between 96.4% to 99.8% for continuous face recognition, which improves over a scheme performing hardware face detection and server-side recognition without Glimpse's techniques by between 1.8-2.5×. The improvement in precision for face recognition without hardware detection is between 1.6-5.5×. For road sign recognition, which does not have a hardware detector, Glimpse achieves precision between 75% and 80%; without Glimpse, continuous detection is non-functional (0.2%-1.9% precision).},

 abstract = {The adoption of indoor navigation for smartphones has been relatively slow in the past years, although it would be direly needed in complex indoor areas. The primary barriers for its adoption include the lack of fine-grained and up-to-date indoor maps and the potential deployment and maintenance cost. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of utilizing crowdsourced data for building a smartphone-based indoor navigation system, focusing on the technical challenges caused by the varying quality of crowdsourced data. We developed iMoon, an indoor navigation system based on sensor-enriched 3D models of indoor environment, and evaluated its performance via a field study in a public building covering around 1,100 square meters. iMoon builds 3D models of indoor environment from crowdsourced 2D photos, and compiles a navigation mesh from the generated 3D models. Depending on the input for 3D modelling, indoor pedestrian paths may be partly missing from the output. iMoon solves this issue by integrating into navigation mesh the pedestrian paths recognized from crowdsourced user motion trajectories. With photo-based 3D models, iMoon supports image-based localization that identifies user's position and facing direction with photos, and provides visual navigation instructions that show when and where to turn. To reduce response delay while maintaining the accuracy of localization, iMoon partitions 3D models based on the density of 3D points, and selects partitions for image-based localization using Wi-Fi fingerprints. According to our experimental results, iMoon works properly, and our solution of indoor localization achieves competitive performance compared with traditional approaches: in most cases, a user can be located within an average of 3.85 seconds with a location error of less than 2 meters and a facing direction error of less than 6 degrees.},

Pando encodes data by Fountain codes and disseminates the rateless stream of encoded packets along the fast and parallel pipelines built on constructive interference and channel diversity. Since every encoded packet contains innovative information to the original data object, Pando avoids duplicate retransmissions and fully exploits the wireless broadcast effect in data dissemination. To transform Pando into a practical system, we devise several techniques, including the integration of Fountain coding with the timing-critical operations of constructive interference and pipelining, a silence based feedback scheme for the one-way pipelined dissemination, and packet-level adaptation of network density and channel diversity. Based on these techniques, Pando can accomplish the data dissemination process entirely over the fast and parallel pipelines. We implement Pando in Contiki and for TelosB sensor motes. We evaluate Pando's performance with various settings on two large-scale open testbeds, Indriya and Flocklab.

 abstract = {Shopping behavior data are of great importance to understand the effectiveness of marketing and merchandising efforts. Online clothing stores are capable capturing customer shopping behavior by analyzing the click stream and customer shopping carts. Retailers with physical clothing stores, however, still lack effective methods to identify comprehensive shopping behaviors. In this paper, we show that backscatter signals of passive RFID tags can be exploited to detect and record how customers browse stores, which items of clothes they pay attention to, and which items of clothes they usually match with. The intuition is that the phase readings of tags attached on desired items will demonstrate distinct yet stable patterns in the time-series when customers look at, pick up or turn over desired items. We design ShopMiner,, a framework that harnesses these unique spatial-temporal correlations of time-series phase readings to detect comprehensive shopping behaviors. We have implemented a prototype of ShopMiner, with a COTS RFID reader and four antennas, and tested its effectiveness in two typical indoor environments. Empirical studies from two-week shopping-like data show that ShopMiner, could achieve high accuracy and efficiency in customer shopping behavior identification.},

 abstract = {Today's smartphone application (hereinafter 'app') markets miss a key piece of information, power consumption of apps. This causes a severe problem for continuous sensing apps as they consume significant power without users' awareness. Users have no choice but to repeatedly install one app after another and experience their power use. To break such an exhaustive cycle, we propose PowerForecaster, a system that provides users with power use of sensing apps at pre-installation time. Such advanced power estimation is extremely challenging since the power cost of a sensing app largely varies with users' physical activities and phone use patterns. We observe that the time for active sensing and processing of an app can vary up to three times with 27 people's sensor traces collected over three weeks. PowerForecaster adopts a novel power emulator that emulates the power use of a sensing app while reproducing users' physical activities and phone use patterns, achieving accurate, personalized power estimation. Our experiments with three commercial apps and two research prototypes show that PowerForecaster achieves 93.4% accuracy under 20 use cases. Also, we optimize the system to accelerate emulation speed and reduce overheads, and show the effectiveness of such optimization techniques.},

It does not require any environment instrumentation or cloud backend. It uses a novel "shadow" tracing method to accurately estimate the vehicle's trajectories despite arbitrary phone/vehicle poses and frequent disturbances. We develop algorithms in a Sequential Monte Carlo framework to represent vehicle states probabilistically, and harness constraints by the garage map and detected landmarks to robustly infer the vehicle location. We also find landmark (e.g., speed bumps, turns) recognition methods reliable against noises, disturbances from bumpy rides and even hand-held movements. We implement a highly efficient prototype and conduct extensive experiments in multiple parking structures of different sizes and structures, with multiple vehicles and drivers. We find that VeTrack can estimate the vehicle's real time location with almost negligible latency, with error of 2-4 parking spaces at 80-percentile.},

However, in order to support receivers with a poor visual channel, e.g. low-resolution cameras, most visual codes are designed for low data capacity and short reading distances. We present our work on Focus, a visual code that avoids earlier work's explicit trade-off between code capacity and channel quality. Rather than encoding the payload directly into individual pixels, Focus encodes the payload over a range of spatial frequencies. As a result, even a receiver with a very poor visual channel (e.g., a low-resolution camera, or a camera experiencing motion blur) can still partly decode a Focus code, because the code's low-frequency components are robust to common channel impairments. A receiver with a good channel can decode all data from the same code. In our demo, we will present a prototype of Focus for smartphones and showcase how it deals with common impairments of the visual channel.},

 abstract = {Energy harvesting is an indispensable mechanism of sensor devices that operate in perpetuity. While harvesting free energy from the environment has enabled many applications, it has also spawned new problems, and new paradigms. Notably, making decisions on when to use high power sensors and external components when energy is scarce, and future supply is unpredictable. Because sensor nodes generally share a single, centralized energy store, seemingly atomic, or unrelated sensing tasks can hamper each other by drawing the supply voltage too low, and draining the energy reservoir. This demonstration presents the United Federation of Peripherals (UFoP), a novel method of separating energy concerns in hardware by allocating dedicated energy storage (in the form of small capacitors) to specific sensor components, and charging them in a prioritized fashion with an analog front end. UFoP gives application designers a more deterministic view of energy and task scheduling, allowing them to make better informed decisions when developing sensor applications. Designers do not have to rely on crude estimates or simulations but can instead depend on in-situ analog measurements to opportunistically drive their applications.},

 abstract = {Micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) swarms are a new class of mobile sensor networks with many applications, including search and rescue, urban surveillance, radiation monitoring, etc. These sensing applications require autonomously navigating a high number of low-cost, low-complexity MAV sensor nodes in hazardous environments. The lack of preexisting localization infrastructure and the limited sensing, computing, and communication abilities of individual nodes makes it challenging for nodes to autonomously navigate to suitable preassigned locations. In this paper, we present a collaborative and adaptive algorithm for resource-constrained MAV nodes to quickly and efficiently navigate to preassigned locations. Using radio fingerprints between flying and landed MAVs acting as radio beacons, the algorithm detects intersections in trajectories of mobile nodes. The algorithm combines noisy dead-reckoning measurements from multiple MAVs at detected intersections to improve the accuracy of the MAVs' location estimations. In addition, the algorithm plans intersecting trajectories of MAV nodes to aid the location estimation and provide desired performance in terms of timeliness and accuracy of navigation. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through a real testbed implementation and large-scale physical feature based simulations. Our results show that, compared to existing autonomous navigation strategies, our algorithm achieves up to 6X reduction in location estimation errors, and as much as 3X improvement in navigation success rate under the given time and accuracy constraints.},

 abstract = {This paper presents SpinLight, an indoor positioning system that uses infrared LED lamps as signal transmitters, and light sensors as receivers. The main idea is to divide the space into spatial beams originating from the light source, and identify each beam with a unique timed sequence of light signals. This sequence is created by a coded shade that covers and rotates around the LED, blocking the light or allowing it to pass through according to pre-defined patterns. The receiver, equipped with a light sensor, is able to determine its spatial beam by detecting the light signals, followed by optimization schemes to refine its location within that beam. We present both 2D and 3D localization designs, demonstrated by a prototype implementation. Experiments show that SpinLight produces a median location error of 3.8 cm, with a 95th percentile of 6.8 cm. The receiver design is very low power and thus can operate for months to years from a button coin battery.},

We hope you enjoy this conference that attracts a diverse set of attendees from both academia and industry and is a leading venue for publications and idea exchange on networked sensing. SenSys this year introduces a highly selective, single-track program featuring systems issues of sensors and sensor-enabled smart systems, broadly defined. It provides an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. The paper review process this year was highly selective. Out of 132 high quality submissions, only 27 were accepted for publication and presentation as full papers, yielding an acceptance rate around 20.45%. Submitted papers underwent a rigorous multistage review process. First, all submissions were checked for compliance and for general quality and topic match. Those not meeting conference criteria were administratively rejected without review. Papers surviving this stage were assigned three reviews in the first stage of the peer review process. At the conclusion of this stage, those papers that none of the reviewers recommended acceptance were rejected. The rest were assigned two additional reviews, thus totaling 5 reviews per paper. An online discussion phase then ensued, resulting in recommending 59 papers for discussion at the in-person physical PC meeting. At the conclusion of the PC meeting, a total of 27 papers were recommended for acceptance to the conference. All recommended papers were assigned shepherds to help ensure that the authors produce a final manuscript that satisfactorily addresses reviewer comments. All shepherded papers were ultimately accepted to the conference. Our program this year covers an exciting set of topics including energy, localization, systems, networking, information services and object/activity recognition. It also includes a poster/demo session, a panel, and two distinguished keynote speakers: Professor Raj Rajkumar from CMU, and Dr. Hendrik Hamann from IBM Research.},

 abstract = {Regular free-weight exercise helps to strengthen the body's natural movements and stabilize muscles that are important to strength, balance, and posture of human beings. Prior works have exploited wearable sensors or RF signal changes (e.g., WiFi and Blue tooth) for activity sensing, recognition and countingetc.. However, none of them have incorporate three key factors necessary for a practical free-weight exercise monitoring system: recognizing free-weight activities on site, assessing their qualities, and providing useful feedbacks to the bodybuilder promptly. Our FEMO system responds to these demands, providing an integrated free-weight exercise monitoring service that incorporates all the essential functionalities mentioned above. FEMO achieves this by attaching passive RFID tags on the dumbbells and leveraging the Doppler shift profile of the reflected backscatter signals for on-site free-weight activity recognition and assessment. The rationale behind FEMO is 1): since each free-weight activity owns unique arm motions, the corresponding Doppler shift profile should be distinguishable to each other and serves as a reliable signature for each activity. 2): the Doppler profile of each activity has a strong spatial-temporal correlation that implicitly reflects the quality of each performed activity. We implement FEMO with COTS RFID devices and conduct a two-week experiment. The preliminary result from 15 volunteers demonstrates that FEMO can be applied to a variety of free-weight activities and users, and provide valuable feedbacks for activity alignment.},

PolyPoint uses ultra-wideband signals to achieve high precision RF time-of-flight estimates between nodes. To further improve accuracy, PolyPoint exploits two forms of diversity: frequency diversity, which leverages several ultra-wideband channels to improve channel response, and antenna diversity, which adds three antennas at 120 degree offsets to mitigate the effects of antenna polarization and nulls. PolyPoint introduces an efficient, novel ranging protocol that maximizes these diversity sources with a minimal number of packets.

 abstract = {Operating Systems (OS) in wireless sensor nodes can be classified into event-driven systems or multithreaded systems. Most event-driven systems, such as TinyOS, drive down power consumption although context switching for real-time processing is not available. Among multithreaded systems, non-preemptive systems, such as Protothreads in Contiki, often have lack of real-time processing capability. In Protothreads, if a higher-priority task was posted while a lower-priority task has been running, the lower-priority task cannot be preempted. Thus, one challenge is that without changing the semantics of Protothreads, how the system can be preemptive as well as lowering the power consumption for real-time tasks such as target tracking. In this paper, we propose a dynamically switchable scheduling system for operating systems using Protothreads where events with time constraint have occurred. This system enables to trigger interruption, to process real-time tasks preferentially when real-time events occurred, and to save energy by executing tasks except real-time tasks as a standard event-driven system. Exeprimental results show that latency in Contiki is reduced by about 75% in the best case and is kept constant with power efficiency.},

We observed both short term and long term changes in the environment; people were allowed to walk in different parts of the site on different days, the field of view of fixed cameras changed over time with the addition of walls, whereas radio and magnetic maps proved unstable with the movement of large structures. To make things worse, the uniforms and helmets that people wear for safety make them very hard to distinguish visually, necessitating the use of additional sensor modalities. In order to address these challenges, we designed a positioning system that uses both anonymous and id-linked sensor measurements and explores the use of cross-modality training to deal with environment dynamics. The system is evaluated in a real construction site and is shown to outperform state of the art multi-target tracking algorithms designed to operate in relatively stable environments.},

PowerBlade occupies a mere 1" by 1" footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws 176 mW continuously, offers 1.13% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1800 W range and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs $11 in modest quantities of about 1000 units.

Although there have been improvements in sprinkler head technology and weather assimilation, state-of-the-art irrigation systems do nothing to adjust for heterogeneous terrain or varying lawn environments. In this work, a computationally lightweight soil moisture movement model is developed, which allows the computation of optimal irrigation valve scheduling using standard optimization techniques. A prototype sprinkler head is produced with the ability to sense local soil moisture conditions, wirelessly communicate, and independently actuate based on the optimal schedule centrally computed. This prototype is then deployed to control two parallel irrigation systems covering a total of more than 10,000 ft$^2$ for a duration of 5 weeks. It is shown that lawn health can be maintained by using the topography of the space to take advantage of runoff to provide improved coverage while using an average of 23.4\% less water. We also show that the initial capital and operating costs of our system could be amortized by our water savings in $~$13 months while maintaining and/or improving quality of irrigation and lawn health.},

This can be used to coordinate wireless sensor networks (WSN). The periodic variations in the light intensity can synchronise the clocks on the sensor nodes, while the ability to modulate the light carrier enables the transmission of control information like channel assignment or transmission schedules.We present Guidelight, a simple mechanism that uses controlled fluctuations in the light intensity to coordinate sensor nodes. Guidelight can wake-up or time synchronise sensor nodes or even send small bits of control information to them. All of these have separate dedicated solutions in WSN. Guidelight aims to provide a single solution to all these problems. Our initial experiments demonstrate the ability of Guidelight to trigger sensor nodes.

Such an observation calls attention to potential errors in existing popular metrics built upon the assumption of link independence. Specifically we propose cETX (correlated ETX), a generalized metric, to compensate for estimation errors suffered by the widely-adopted ETX in the presence of correlated interference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a unified metric embracing both temporal and spatiotemporal correlations. The highlight of the cETX metric is its broad applicability and effectiveness. Evaluations on ZigBee (802.15.4) and Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n) testbeds deployed in a lab, corridor, and on a bridge reveal that: Simply replacing ETX with cETX (i) cuts down the error by 70.2% and 62.1%, respectively, and (ii) saves averages of 22% and 37% communication cost in three unicast [4, 13, 17] and nine broadcast protocols [7, 18, 23, 24, 27, 30, 40] at the price of only 0.7% additional overhead.},

It provides an unprecedented means of collecting data from the physical world, particularly through the use of modern smartphones, which are equipped with high-resolution cameras and various micro-electrical sensors. In this paper, we address the critical task of reconstructing the indoor interior view of a building from crowdsourced data. We propose, design, and prototype IndoorCrowd2D, a smartphone-empowered crowdsourcing system for indoor scene reconstruction. We first formulate the problem via trackable models and then employ a divide and conquer approach to address the inherently incomplete, opportunistic, and noisy crowdsourced data. By utilizing the image information and sensory data in a coordinated way, our system demonstrates high result-accuracy, as well as allows a gradual build-up procedure of the hallway skeleton. Our evaluation result shows that IndoorCrowd2D achieves a precision around 85%, a 100% recall and a F-score around 95% for reconstructing college buildings from 1,151 datasets uploaded by 25 users. This reveals that our image and sensor hybrid method is more robust to overcome errors and outliers as compared to image-only method.},

 abstract = {Precise positioning of an automobile to within lane-level precision can enable better navigation and context-awareness. However, GPS by itself cannot provide such precision in obstructed urban environments. In this paper, we present a system called CARLOC for lane-level positioning of automobiles. CARLOC uses three key ideas in concert to improve positioning accuracy: it uses digital maps to match the vehicle to known road segments; it uses vehicular sensors to obtain odometry and bearing information; and it uses crowd-sourced location of estimates of roadway landmarks that can be detected by sensors available in modern vehicles. CARLOC unifies these ideas in a probabilistic position estimation framework, widely used in robotics, called the sequential Monte Carlo method. Through extensive experiments on a real vehicle, we show that CARLOC achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in an obstructed urban setting, an order-of-magnitude improvement over a high-end GPS device.},

 abstract = {The widespread presence of motion sensors on users' personal mobile devices has spawned a growing research interest in human activity recognition (HAR). However, when deployed at a large-scale, e.g., on multiple devices, the performance of a HAR system is often significantly lower than in reported research results. This is due to variations in training and test device hardware and their operating system characteristics among others. In this paper, we systematically investigate sensor-, device- and workload-specific heterogeneities using 36 smartphones and smartwatches, consisting of 13 different device models from four manufacturers. Furthermore, we conduct experiments with nine users and investigate popular feature representation and classification techniques in HAR research. Our results indicate that on-device sensor and sensor handling heterogeneities impair HAR performances significantly. Moreover, the impairments vary significantly across devices and depends on the type of recognition technique used. We systematically evaluate the effect of mobile sensing heterogeneities on HAR and propose a novel clustering-based mitigation technique suitable for large-scale deployment of HAR, where heterogeneity of devices and their usage scenarios are intrinsic.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, mobile devices have exhibited increasing popularity in recent years. To support the anytime-anywhere service model of mobile devices, one important problem related to the screen display arises when using these devices (e.g., smartphone and tablet) under various lighting conditions. On one hand, it is hard for users to see the display clearly under strong lighting conditions (e.g., sunlight). On the other hand, the screen appears dazzling under weak lighting conditions. This problem related to the mobile device display can significantly degrade user experience and undermine the successful deployment of the anytime-anywhere mobile service model. Existing solutions mainly focus on the automatic adjustment of brightness level under different light conditions. We show that merely utilizing brightness level to solve the display problem is not enough to maintain the user experience under both strong and weak lighting scenarios through experimenting with over 200 volunteers. In this work, we take a different approach by investigating automatic color scheme adjustment to improve user experience. We find that Readability, Comfort level and Similarity are major factors that contribute to user experience. In recognizing these problems, we propose a system, ColorVert, which utilizes the DKL color space to adaptively transform color schemes by sensing ambient light to improve user experience under various lighting scenarios. Our experimental evaluation with over 200 precipitants and various mobile devices demonstrates that ColorVert is more effective in both maintaining as well as improving user experience compared with the existing automatic brightness adjustment system.},

 abstract = {Trilateration has been widely and successfully employed to locate outdoor mobile devices due to its accuracy. However, it cannot be directly applied for indoor localization due to issues such as non-line-of-sight measurement and multipath fading. Though fingerprinting overcomes these issues, its accuracy is often hampered by signal noise and the choice of similarity metric between signal vectors. We propose INTRI, a novel, simple and effective indoor localization technique combining the strengths of trilateration and fingerprinting. For a signal level received from an access point (AP) by the target, INTRI first forms a contour consisting of all the reference points (RPs) of the same signal level for that AP, taking into account the signal noise. The target is hence at the juncture of all the contours. With an optimization formulation following the spirit of trilateration, it then finds the target location by minimizing the distance between the position and all the contours. INTRI further uses an online algorithm based on signal correlation to efficiently calibrate heterogeneous mobile devices to achieve higher accuracy. We have implemented INTRI, and our extensive simulation and experiments in an international airport, a shopping mall and our university campus show that it outperforms recent schemes with much lower location error (often by more than 20%).},

 abstract = {Time slotted operation is a well-proven approach to achieve highly reliable low-power networking through scheduling and channel hopping. It is, however, difficult to apply time slotting to dynamic networks as envisioned in the Internet of Things. Commonly, these applications do not have pre-defined periodic traffic patterns and nodes can be added or removed dynamically. This paper addresses the challenge of bringing TSCH (Time Slotted Channel Hopping MAC) to such dynamic networks. We focus on low-power IPv6 and RPL networks, and introduce Orchestra. In Orchestra, nodes autonomously compute their own, local schedules. They maintain multiple schedules, each allocated to a particular traffic plane (application, routing, MAC), and updated automatically as the topology evolves. Orchestra (re)computes local schedules without signaling overhead, and does not require any central or distributed scheduler. Instead, it relies on the existing network stack information to maintain the schedules. This scheme allows Orchestra to build non-deterministic networks while exploiting the robustness of TSCH. We demonstrate the practicality of Orchestra and quantify its benefits through extensive evaluation in two testbeds, on two hardware platforms. Orchestra reduces, or even eliminates, network contention. In long running experiments of up to 72~h we show that Orchestra achieves end-to-end delivery ratios of over 99.99%. Compared to RPL in asynchronous low-power listening networks, Orchestra improves reliability by two orders of magnitude, while achieving a similar latency-energy balance.},

 abstract = {The wireless sensor network community is currently undergoing a platform paradigm shift, moving away from classical single-processor motes toward heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. These emerging platforms promise efficient concurrent processing with energy-proportional system performance. The use of shared interconnects and shared memory for inter-processor communication, however, causes interference in the time, power, and clock domains, which prevents designers from fully harnessing these benefits. We thus designed Bolt, the first ultra-low-power processor interconnect for the compositional construction of heterogeneous wireless embedded platforms. This paper presents the architectural blueprint for interconnecting two independent processors, while enabling asynchronous inter-processor communication with predictable run-time behavior. We detail a prototype implementation of Bolt, and apply formal methods to analytically derive bounds on the execution time of its message passing operations. Experiments with a custom-built dual-processor platform show that our Bolt prototype incurs a negligible power overhead relative to state-of-the-art platforms, offers predictable message passing with empirical bounds that match the analytical ones to within a few clock cycles, and achieves a high throughput of up to 3.3 Mbps.},

 abstract = {Many elderly who are suffering from dementia are also suffering from agitation. While most assisted living facilities and home health care situations rely upon caregivers to monitor and record agitation of their patients, the accuracy is limited because the caregiver must be present during the agitation and must record the event properly. Accurate 24-7 data would help physicians with improved diagnoses and care. To solve this problem we developed KinVocal, a system that continuously monitors and detects agitated vocal events and can be used for the elderly population suffering from dementia. KinVocal, using a novel combination of acoustic signal processing and multiple text mining techniques, automatically detects and records the 8 major vocal agitations for dementia patients as defined by the medical community. This includes: constant unwarranted request for attention or help, making verbal sexual advances, crying, screaming, laughing, cursing, speaking in repetitive sentences, and negativism. The novelty of KinVocal includes the comprehensiveness of addressing all 8 vocal events, using the text of the vocalizations only when accurate, combining text and acoustic features when necessary, and employing text mining and feature identification. A comprehensive performance evaluation includes using data from Youtube and movies, controlled experiments, and real in-home deployments. The results show high accuracy for all 8 vocal events.},

 abstract = {Buildings across the world contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption. Targeted feedback can help occupants optimise energy consumption. In our first work we present techniques for actionable feedback across fridges and air conditioning (HVAC) units, which can save upto 25% of fridge energy and identify homes needing feedback on HVAC setpoint schedule with 84% accuracy. In our next work, we do an extensive sensor deployment in a home in Delhi, India; monitoring appliance level power, home aggregate power and other ambient parameters. Our study presents various insights unseen in the developed world, such as: frequent voltage brownouts, poor network reliability, long lasting blackouts, heavy dominance of fridge and HVAC to overall energy consumption. Our study verifies that measuring appliance level power scales poorly in cost and maintenance. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is viewed as a viable alternative where machine learning techniques are used to break down aggregate household energy consumption into contributing appliances. Despite the existence of a rich volume of literature in NILM, it remained virtually impossible to compare NILM works due to: i) lack of existence of benchmarks; ii) previous work tested on single data set; iii) inconsistent metrics. To address these challenges we developed an open source toolkit: Non-intrusive load monitoring toolkit (NILMTK), designed specifically to enable the comparison of NILM algorithms. While many new NILM techniques have been proposed in recent times, it is not clear if these can enable energy saving and whether higher accuracy translates to higher energy saving. We explore these questions in our recent work and find that existing energy disaggregation techniques do not provide power traces with sufficient fidelity to support the feedback techniques we developed in our earlier work. Our results indicate a need to revisit the metrics by which disaggregation is evaluated.},

 abstract = {Embedded systems that are wirelessly reprogrammed can be rendered useless by certain programming errors, excessive power consumption, or misconfigurations in the hardware. These types of situations can leave a device in a state that compromises its programmability, often rendering the device useless. Existing attempts to address the problem of robust wireless reprogramming have all been software-based solutions, that are vulnerable to certain errors, such as memory corruption, can corrupt the recovery programs. We propose a hardware-based solution to wireless reprogramming, physically separating the programmer and target device. This separation limits the propagation of errors, and ensures the device will always be recoverable. In this poster we will present the design and an early prototype of our approach -- an ultra-low-power, low-cost hardware solution to ensure recovery from fatal errors and reprogrammability in wireless systems. This poster discusses the current system design, initial results, and system analysis from our current prototype. We also present future and ongoing directions, as well as key research questions.

 abstract = {We are becoming increasingly surrounded by smart and connected devices, popularly known as the Internet of Things. The emerging user interface paradigm for many such things eschews physical buttons, knobs, and displays in favor of virtual interfaces that are downloaded from the web and rendered on remote platforms---like smartphones. However, such smartphone app-based interfaces often require tedious discovery and installation, as well as device discovery, pairing, and configuration before a user can interact with a nearby device. Requiring an explicit app install for each new device type scales poorly with device growth, and particularly hinders casual interactions with ambient devices. Instead of the high-friction, walled-garden approach now taking root, we propose name, a physical web browser that provides a seamless, scalable approach to browsing and interacting with nearby things. name leverages multiple network patterns and modern web technologies to provide users with rich device interfaces, even for devices under network or power constraints. We argue that this approach scales better and that it provides more intuitive and natural functionality for both users and developers. This demo presents the basic concept, allows others to experience our preliminary implementation, and raises several open research questions.},

PowerBlade occupies a mere 1" × 1" footprint, offers a 1/16" profile, draws less than 180 mW itself, offers 1.13% error on unity power factor loads in the 2-1200 W range and slightly worse for non-linear and reactive loads, and costs $11 in modest quantities of about 1,000 units. This new design point enables affordable large-scale studies of plug-load energy usage--an area of growing national importance.},

 abstract = {We present a holistic architecture for energy management in sensor networks. Our architecture is based on a model-driven approach which attempts to (a) establish functional relationships across different components of the software stack and the interrelated parameters based on empirical data, (b) use the maximum sensor value and time-synchronization errors acceptable by the users of the sensor network application as input to establish minimum quality of service requirements, and (c) optimize the parameter values of all the software modules within the node's application stack to minimize total energy consumption for each sensor node. We explore the trade-offs of the design space by using a non-trivial application that includes sensing, time synchronization and routing modules and show that when using our architecture, we can provide energy savings in the average of 37% to 76% while still maintaining quality of service both in terms of the expected sensing and time-synchronization errors. We further show that even when using modules that perform significantly better than others with default values (e.g. ORW >> CTP), we can still reduce overall energy consumption by properly adjusting the parameters of lowest performance modules and provide energy savings in the average of 30% to 43%.},

Users inside the demo area will be able to determine their location and can directly plot it relatively to a map of the area using our app on a smartphone. Once a receiving device has determined its initial position, it can synchronize its audio clock with the transmission infrastructure to perform TOF-based localization, which provides similar position accuracy to TDOA based localization with fewer beacons. Multilateration and trilateration processing for each device's location is offloaded onto a cloud-based solver that can provide localization as a service to ALPS and similar TOF/TDOA based systems.},

 abstract = {This work presents a distributed implementation for processing Maximizing Range Sum (MaxRS) query in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). MaxRS query is useful in many spatially-distributed event monitoring and target tracking applications. Given the location and current readings of the nodes, and a rectangle R, MaxRS finds a location of R that maximizes the sum of the readings of all the nodes covered by R. Our system performs MaxRS query in a user-specified time-interval γ and using the result obtained, attempts to maintain a certain degree of energy conservation in the WSN, based on a user-defined threshold δ. Since centralized processing of the raw readings and subsequently determining the MaxRS may incur significant communication overheads, we developed a distributed algorithm to compute MaxRS. We implemented our system in a heterogeneous WSN consisting of TelosB and SunSPOT motes, and illustrate the end-user tools: GUI for specifying required parameters, and real-time visualization of MaxRS solutions and estimated network energy consumption.},

 abstract = {Untethered sensing devices have, for decades, powered all system components (processors, sensors, actuators, etc) from a single shared energy store (battery or capacitor). When designing batteryless sensors that are powered by harvested energy, this traditional approach results in devices that charge slowly and that are more error prone, inflexible, and inefficient than they could be. This paper presents a novel federated approach to energy storage, called UFoP, that partitions and prioritizes harvested energy automatically into multiple isolated smaller energy stores (capacitors). UFoP simplifies task scheduling, enables efficient use of components with differing voltage requirements, and produces devices that charge more quickly under identical harvesting conditions than a traditional centralized approach. We have implemented a UFoP reference design and conducted extensive experimental evaluation, including a short deployment. Our experimental results using an MSP430-based prototype show that UFoP provides as much as 10% more computational availability, and as much as four times more radio availability than the centralized approach. For all applications and energy environments evaluated, UFoP harvested 0.7-10.2% more energy than the centralized equivalent; meaning UFoP adds zero energy overhead.},

To make the Tutte polynomials for graphs, we use the fastest program that was recently developed.

@inproceedings{Varshney:2015:DTR:2809695.2809720,
 abstract = {We present DPT: a wireless sensor network protocol for bulk traffic that uniquely leverages electronically switchable directional (ESD) antennas. Bulk traffic is found in several scenarios and supporting protocols based on standard antenna technology abound. ESD antennas may improve performance in these scenarios; for example, by reducing channel contention as the antenna can steer the radiated energy only towards the intended receivers, and by extending the communication range at no additional energy cost. The corresponding protocol support, however, is largely missing. DPT addresses precisely this issue. First, while the network is quiescent, we collect link metrics across all possible antenna configurations. We use this information to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) that allows us to find two multi-hop disjoint paths connecting source and sink, along with the corresponding antenna configurations. Domain-specific heuristics we conceive ameliorate the processing demands in solving the CSP, improving scalability. Second, the routing configuration we obtain is injected back into the network. During the actual bulk transfer, the source funnels data through the two paths by quickly alternating between them. Packet forwarding occurs deterministically at every hop. This allows the source to implicitly "clock" the entire pipeline, sparing the need of proactively synchronizing the transmissions across the two paths. Our results, obtained in a real testbed using 802.15.4-compliant radios and custom ESD antennas we built, indicate that DPT approaches the maximum throughput supported by the link layer, peaking at 214 kbit/s in the settings we test.},

However, the sensory data provided by individual participants are usually not reliable. To identify truthful values from the crowd sensing data, the topic of truth discovery, whose goal is to estimate user quality and infer truths through quality-aware data aggregation, has drawn significant attention. Though able to improve aggregation accuracy, existing truth discovery approaches fail to take into consideration an important issue in their design, i.e., the protection of individual users' private information. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-enabled privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPTD) framework for crowd sensing systems, which can achieve the protection of not only users' sensory data but also their reliability scores derived by the truth discovery approaches. The key idea of the proposed framework is to perform weighted aggregation on users' encrypted data using homomorphic cryptosystem. In order to deal with large-scale data, we also propose to parallelize PPTD with MapReduce framework. Through extensive experiments on not only synthetic data but also real world crowd sensing systems, we justify the guarantee of strong privacy and high accuracy of our proposed framework.},
