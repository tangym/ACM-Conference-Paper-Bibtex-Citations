 abstract = {We present Monoxalyze, a keychain-sized, Bluetooth-based, carbon monoxide breathalyzer that aims to enable mobile, scalable smoking cessation intervention programs. These intervention programs have been shown to greatly increase the rate of a quit attempt, which in turn decreases the rate of smoking, a major public health problem that still affects over one billion people around the world. Currently, intervention programs verify cessation compliance by requiring program participants to periodically visit clinics and exhale through large, expensive carbon monoxide breathalyzers---a practice that cannot scale to one billion smokers. Monoxalyze enables mobile cessation verification by working with a user's smartphone to establish a ring of spatio-temporal transitive trust between the Monoxalyze device, the user, and the smartphone, a concept that can be applied to many third-party monitoring applications. In Monoxalyze, the links of this trust are represented by simultaneous exhalation verification, facial recognition, and device-to-phone visible light authentication. In our evaluation, we show that Monoxalyze lasts over 80 days between charges, and has the ability to verify a Monoxalyze user. With a small user study we show that Monoxalyze determines smoking cessation with 92% accuracy, a level comparable with commercial CO breathalyzers. Further contributions describe the design decisions behind creating a low-power BLE device.},

Reasons for this include the diversity of network scenarios and the stochastic nature of wireless experiments. Leveraging on the excellent testbeds and tools that have been built to support experimental validation, we make the case for a reference benchmark to promote a fair comparison and reproducibility of results.

 abstract = {Opportunistic routing protocols tackle the problem of efficient data collection in dynamic wireless sensor networks, where the radio is duty-cycled to save energy and the topology changes unpredictably due to node mobility and/or link dynamics. Unlike protocols that maintain a routing structure, in opportunistic protocols nodes forward packets to any neighbor that wakes up first, reducing latency and energy costs and increasing the resilience to network dynamics. We claim the performance of existing opportunistic routing protocols can be improved while retaining their resilience by harnessing the synergy between duty cycling and opportunistic forwarding. To prove this claim, we present Staffetta, the first practical duty-cycle adaptation scheme for opportunistic low-power wireless protocols. Staffetta dynamically adapts each node's wake-up frequency to its current forwarding cost, so nodes closer to the sink become more active than nodes farther away. In this way, Staffetta biases the forwarding choices toward the sink as the neighbor waking up first is also likely to offer high routing progress. Experiments on two testbeds with four different opportunistic routing mechanisms demonstrate that Staffetta achieves severalfold performance improvements compared with a fixed wake-up frequency. As a case a point, Staffetta enables ORW, the state-of-the-art opportunistic routing protocol, to reduce end-to-end packet latency by 79-452 × and energy consumption by 2.75-9× while increasing packet delivery ratio compared with ORW's default link-layer settings.},

 abstract = {Driven by the proliferation of sensor-rich mobile devices, crowd sensing has emerged as a new paradigm of gathering information about the physical world. In crowd sensing applications, user observations are usually unevenly distributed across the monitored entities, and this gives rise to two major challenges -- redundancy and sparsity. On one hand, multiple users may observe the same entity, and their observations are sometimes conflicting with each other due to the unreliable nature of human-carried sensors. On the other hand, crowd sensing data are usually very sparse, and there may exist considerable number of entities that never receive any observations from users. Some existing work studies these two challenges separately. However, we can gain great benefits by dealing with them jointly. In this paper, we develop an integrated framework to estimate the true values of entities from redundant and sparse data in crowd sensing applications. In this framework, we propose an effective algorithm to infer the "missing" observations for each entity, and aggregate both user-contributed and inferred observations to discover the true values of entities. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world crowd sensing systems to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework on correctly inferring entity truths from redundant and sparse data.},

 abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized the way sensor data are analyzed and interpreted. The accuracy gains these approaches offer make them attractive for the next generation of mobile, wearable and embedded sensory applications. However, state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms typically require a significant amount of device and processor resources, even just for the inference stages that are used to discriminate high-level classes from low-level data. The limited availability of memory, computation, and energy on mobile and embedded platforms thus pose a significant challenge to the adoption of these powerful learning techniques. In this paper, we propose SparseSep, a new approach that leverages the sparsification of fully connected layers and separation of convolutional kernels to reduce the resource requirements of popular deep learning algorithms. As a result, SparseSep allows large-scale DNNs and CNNs to run efficiently on mobile and embedded hardware with only minimal impact on inference accuracy. We experiment using SparseSep across a variety of common processors such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, ARM Cortex M0 and M3, and Nvidia Tegra K1, and show that it allows inference for various deep models to execute more efficiently; for example, on average requiring 11.3 times less memory and running 13.3 times faster on these representative platforms.},

However, it has been shown that the success of CT in IEEE 802.15.4 is mainly due to the DSSS. In view of the great potential of long range sub-GHz technologies for future smart meter applications, we assess the feasibility of applying CT to non-DSSS sub-GHz receivers. In this work, we evaluate the FSK-based receiver performance in the critical case - the scenario that concurrent transmitted signals are received with the same power such so the mutual interference become worst. Our evaluations are based on the 2-FSK mode of TI CC1120 chips. The results show that the basic 2-FSK mode is vulnerable to CT. On the other hand, if the FEC and the interleaver are adopted, the receiver can survive in the heavy interfering region as long as the timing offset is smaller than 1 μs and the CFO is larger than 5 KHz.},

To address this limitation, we propose a scalable sensor network architecture - called Sensor Network Over White Spaces (SNOW) - by exploiting the TV white spaces. Many WSN applications need low data rate, low power operation, and scalability in terms of geographic areas and the number of nodes. The long communication range of white space radios significantly increases the chances of packet collision at the base station. We achieve scalability and energy efficiency by splitting channels into narrowband orthogonal subcarriers and enabling packet receptions on the subcarriers in parallel with a single radio. The physical layer of SNOW is designed through a distributed implementation of OFDM that enables distinct orthogonal signals from distributed nodes. Its MAC protocol handles subcarrier allocation among the nodes and transmission scheduling. We implement SNOW in GNU radio using USRP devices. Experiments demonstrate that it can correctly decode in less than 0.1ms multiple packets received in parallel at different subcarriers, thus drastically enhancing the scalability of WSN.},

 abstract = {Smart homes will compose of multiple sensors that will sense, compute and transmit information to a central cloud, all of which are energy consuming tasks. We propose to demonstrate a software-defined solution for wirelessly charging these sensors using RF energy, thereby extending their lifetimes. In our demo, the actions of more than one energy transmitter (ET) are synchronized in phase and frequency in real time using periodic feedback from the target sensor, but without any common clock reference. The controller selects the optimal subset of ETs to satisfy the energy request from a given sensor, which cooperatively beamform RF energy towards that sensor. Our software-defined framework, implemented in Python, allows the central controller to automatically discover the installed sensors, obtain energy needs, and schedule charging tasks in an asynchronous and non-blocking manner that allows the network to scale. The demonstration includes advancements in design and fabrication of RF energy harvesting circuits that interface with the TI EZ430 sensors, implementation of a software-defined control and data plane, as well as a real-time distributed beamforming algorithm on USRP radios that results in a battery-free network of sensors.},

Our vision of wearable platforms aims for long battery life but with the flexibility and security to support multiple applications. To achieve long battery life with a workload comprising apps from multiple developers, these platforms must have robust mechanisms for app isolation and developer tools for optimizing resource usage. We introduce the Amulet Platform for constrained wearable devices, which includes an ultra-low-power hardware architecture and a companion software framework, including a highly efficient event-driven programming model, low-power operating system, and developer tools for profiling ultra-low-power applications at compile time. We present the design and evaluation of our prototype Amulet hardware and software, and show how the framework enables developers to write energy-efficient applications.

 abstract = {We propose a new class of wireless transmission schemes decoupling synchronization headers from payloads to create new transmission primitives involving a second sender. By transmitting a synchronization header only we can let nearby nodes receive fragments of a packet without having to receive that packet's synchronization header, and by using the capture effect we can overwrite portions of the payload of longer ongoing packets. We explore two scenarios potentially benefiting from such schemes. A) First, we consider crossing a network chasm over which all links are of poor quality: by broadcasting a fabricated packet header on the receiving side of the chasm all receiving nodes are informed to record the packet to the best of their ability. B) Second, we investigate the insertion of short high-priority packets into longer lower-priority transmissions from a different sender. This has the advantage that high-priority senders do not need to wait for the medium to become free but can begin sending at once, while receivers lose only the affected portion of their already incoming low-priority packets. Further, we examine two techniques to reduce the amount of symbol decoding errors caused by using a mismatching synchronization header: 1) careful transmission timing and 2) correction of deterministic symbol decoding errors. In scenario A) these techniques improve the chance of every part of a packet being received successfully by some node on the receiving side of the chasm from 5% to up to 30%. In scenario B) we reach successful decoding of the injected packet in up to 70% of cases. In proof of concept implementations on a testbed of TelosB nodes we confirm the soundness of our methods.},

Hitch-Hike's key invention is a novel technique called codeword translation, which allows a backscatter tag to embed its information on standard 802.11b packets by just translating the original transmitted 802.11b codeword to another valid 802.11b codeword. This allows any 802.11b receiver to decode the backscattered packet, thus opening the doors for widespread deployment of low-power backscatter communication using widely available WiFi infrastructure. We show experimentally that HitchHike can achieve an uplink throughput of up to 300Kbps at ranges of up to 34m and ranges of up to 54m where it achieves a throughput of around 200Kbps.},

 abstract = {We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization. SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware. While ultra-wideband radios provide a pairwise range estimate natively, we show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53% decrease in median range error. Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range estimate, we leverage an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for localization that ameliorates this overhead. In stationary and fast-moving environments SurePoint achieves up to 0.08 m median error and 0.53 m 99th percentile error. As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we employ a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space. This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference phenomenon, however SurePoint is the first to demonstrate constructive interface using the 802.15.4a ultra-wideband PHY. Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we utilize TriPoint, a dedicated "drop-in" ranging module that provides a simple I2C interface. We show that this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to handle other tasks. This demo complements the paper "SurePoint: Exploiting Ultra Wideband Flooding and Diversity to Provide Robust, Scalable, High-Fidelity Indoor Localization" to be presented at SenSys'16.},

We hope you enjoy this conference that attracts a diverse set of attendees from both academia and industry and is a leading venue for publications and idea exchange on networked sensing. SenSys this year introduces a highly selective, single-track program featuring systems issues of sensors and sensor-enabled smart systems, broadly defined. It provides an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. The paper review process this year was highly selective. Out of 132 high quality submissions, only 27 were accepted for publication and presentation as full papers, yielding an acceptance rate around 20.45%. Submitted papers underwent a rigorous multistage review process. First, all submissions were checked for compliance and for general quality and topic match. Those not meeting conference criteria were administratively rejected without review. Papers surviving this stage were assigned three reviews in the first stage of the peer review process. At the conclusion of this stage, those papers that none of the reviewers recommended acceptance were rejected. The rest were assigned two additional reviews, thus totaling 5 reviews per paper. An online discussion phase then ensued, resulting in recommending 59 papers for discussion at the in-person physical PC meeting. At the conclusion of the PC meeting, a total of 27 papers were recommended for acceptance to the conference. All recommended papers were assigned shepherds to help ensure that the authors produce a final manuscript that satisfactorily addresses reviewer comments. All shepherded papers were ultimately accepted to the conference. Our program this year covers an exciting set of topics including energy, localization, systems, networking, information services and object/activity recognition. It also includes a poster/demo session, a panel, and two distinguished keynote speakers: Professor Raj Rajkumar from CMU, and Dr. Hendrik Hamann from IBM Research.},

Using IP as the basis of low power radio networks, together with application layer standards designed for this purpose is one way forward. This research focuses on implementing and deploying a system using Contiki, 6LoWPAN over an 868 MHz radio network, together with CoAP as a standard application layer protocol. A system was deployed in the Cairngorm mountains in Scotland as an environmental sensor network, measuring streams, temperature profiles in peat and periglacial features. It was found that RPL provided an effective routing algorithm, and that the use of UDP packets with CoAP proved to be an energy efficient application layer.

If the rapid proliferation of networks and high-tech miniature sensors makes this reality possible, the ever-growing complexity of the metrics and parameters governing such systems raises serious issues in terms of privacy, security and computing capability. In this demonstration, we show a new system, able to estimate a user's mobility profile based on anonymized and lightweight smartphone data. In particular, this system is composed of (1) a web analytics platform, able to analyze multimodal sensing traces and improve our understanding of complex mobility patterns, and (2) a smartphone application, able to show a user's profile generated locally in the form of a spider graph. In particular, this application uses anonymized and privacy-friendly data and methods, obtained thanks to the combination of Wi-Fi traces, activity detection and graph theory, made available independent of any personal information.

Such localization is important for many smart building applications, such as efficient building management, senior/health care, and security. Compared to other sensing approaches, footstep-induced vibration provides a sensing system which is sparse and non-intrusive. The main challenge of achieving high accuracy using such approach is frequency-dependent wave propagation characteristics, such as dispersion, in floor structure. These characteristics result in distortions in the shape of signal. To overcome such distortions, we decompose the vibration signals into different frequency components using wavelet transform and focus on specific components in all the sensors. In a set of experiments in a real structure, our approach results in average localization errors of 0.41 meters, a 4.4X reduction compared to a baseline approach using raw data.},

Hardware has evolved past 8 and 16 bit microcontrollers: there are now 32 bit processors with lower energy budgets and greater computing capability. New wireless link layers have emerged, creating protocols that support direct interaction with users, but introduce novel limitations that systems must consider.

The time has come to look beyond optimizing networks of motes. We look towards new technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Cortex M processors, and capable multi-process operating systems, with new application spaces such as personal area networks, and new capabilities and requirements in security and privacy to inform contemporary hardware and software platforms.

 abstract = {We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization. SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware. While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53% decrease in median ranging error. Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for localization that ameliorates this overhead. We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08 m median error and 0.53 m 99th percentile error. As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space. This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband radios. Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated "drop-in" ranging module that provides a simple I2C interface. We show that this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to handle other tasks.},

As the demand for IoT devices grows, the need for stronger authentication and access control mechanisms is greater than ever. Legacy authentication and access control mechanisms do not meet the growing needs of IoT. In particular, there is a dire need for a holistic authentication mechanism throughout the IoT device life-cycle, namely from the manufacturing to the retirement of the device. As a plausible solution, we present Authentication of Things (AoT), a suite of protocols that incorporate authentication and access control during the entire IoT device life span. Primarily, AoT relies on Identity- and Attribute-Based Cryptography to cryptographically enforce Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Additionally, AoT facilitates secure (in terms of stronger authentication) wireless interoperability of new and guest devices in a seamless manner. To validate our solution, we have developed AoT for Android smartphones like the LG G4 and evaluated all the cryptographic primitives over more constrained devices like the Intel Edison and the Arduino Due. This included the implementation of an Attribute-Based Signature (ABS) scheme. Our results indicate AoT ranges from highly efficient on resource-rich devices to affordable on resource-constrained IoT-like devices. Typically, an ABS generation takes around 27 ms on the LG G4, 282 ms on the Intel Edison, and 1.5 s on the Arduino Due.},

The toothbrushing gestures are recognized based on inertial sensing data from the wrist watch. As the acoustic signal collected from the watch is correlated with the motion of toothbrushing stroke, acoustic sensing algorithm is designed to assist in recognition.

Wheeled robots, usually employed for such tasks, strive to adapt to the wide range of environments where WSNs are deployed, from chaotic office spaces to neatly raked potato fields. For this reason, wheeled robots often require an expensive customization step in order to adapt, for example, their localization and navigation systems to the specific environment. To avoid this issue, we present Gondola, a parametric robot infrastructure based on pulling wires, rather than wheels. Gondola avoids the most common problems of wheeled robots and easily adapts to many WSNs' scenarios.

To address this problem, it is necessary for both residents and city administrations to understand air quality in their immediate environment with fine-grained temporal-spatial resolution. Currently both fixed and mobile systems are used to attempt to sense the pollution field. However, they generally are expensive, cover small areas and thus result in lower accuracy. To address this problem, we present Gotcha II, our environmental sensing system that utilizes data from both official sites and mobile sensing devices deployed on vehicles to infer air pollution. We present our experiences and calibration methods to improve data accuracy through the deployment on 100 vehicles in the greater Shenzhen area.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes the design and implementation of low-- energy tokens for smart interaction with capacitive touch-- enabled devices by associating the token's identity with its contact, or touch. The proposed token's design features two key novel technical components: (1) a through--touch--sensor low--energy communication method for token identification and (2) a touch--sensor energy harvesting technique. The communication mechanism involves the token transmitting its identity (ID) directly through the touch--sensor by artificially modifying the effective capacitance between the touch-- sensor and token surfaces. This approach consumes significantly lower energy compared to traditional electrical signal modulation approaches. By enabling the token to harvest energy from touch--screen sensors or touch--surfaces the token is rendered battery--free. Through experimental evaluations using a prototype implementation, the proposed design is shown to achieve at least 95% identification accuracy. It is also shown to consume less energy than competitive techniques (NFC P2P and Bluetooth Low--Energy) for communicating a short ID sequence. The adoption of this technology among users is evaluated through a user study on 12 subjects.},

This technique abates up to 99% of application messages; yet, recent work has shown it achieves "only" up to a 7x lifetime improvement when executed atop a mainstream network stack (e.g., CTP + BoX-MAC), as the idle listening and topology maintenance in the latter are ill-suited to the sparse traffic induced by data prediction. This paper presents a novel network stack designed for data prediction, CRYSTAL, that exploits synchronous transmissions to quickly and reliably transmit model updates when these occur (infrequently but often concurrently), and minimizes overhead during the (frequent) periods with no updates. Based on 90-node experiments in the Indriya testbed and with 7 public datasets, we show that CRYSTAL unleashes the full potential of data prediction, achieving per-mille duty cycle with perfect reliability and very small latency.},

As different liquid foods with different chemical compositions yield uniquely different spectral signatures, Nutrilyzer's signal processing and machine learning algorithm learn to map the photoacoustic signature to various liquid food characteristics including nutrients and adulterants. We evaluated Nutrilyzer for milk nutrient prediction (i.e., milk protein) and milk adulterant detection. We have also explored Nutrilyzer for alcohol concentration prediction.

The camera used has a frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps), so in conventional fashion, it is incapable to detain significant information about any vibration frequency which is not in the range of Nyquist theory of frequency (within a range of ±15 Hz). We have solved the challenge using optical strobing phenomena for capturing modulo (of division) between object's frequency and strobing frequency using camera. Motion in the video is tracked by conventional image processing technique. Finally, object vibration is calculated from the frequency plot and optical strobing frequency. Under most of the cases, the application estimates vibration frequency values, within a range of ±1.5% of error.},

In particular, we demonstrate that an adversary can leverage off-the-shelf hardware to manipulate the data to the device that collects drivers' habits for insurance rate customization and obtain a fraudulent insurance discount. In response to this type of attack, we also propose a defense mechanism that escalates the protection for insurers' data collection. The main idea of this mechanism is to augment the insurer's data collection device with the ability to gather unforgeable data acquired from the physical world, and then leverage these data to identify manipulated data points. Our defense mechanism leveraged a statistical model built on unmanipulated data and is robust to manipulation methods that are not foreseen previously. We have implemented this defense mechanism as a proof-of-concept prototype and tested its effectiveness in the real world. Our evaluation shows that our defense mechanism exhibits a false positive rate of 0.032 and a false negative rate of 0.013.},

Supported by new sensing capabilities, the capability to detect and measure phenomena throughout a large area will allow deeper insight and understanding into how cities work. The challenge of city-scale sensing is not limited to developing new sensing applications, however. A sensor must be installed in a location. It must be provided power, storage, and communications. All these tasks stand aside from the desired sensing effort, but are necessary nevertheless. In this demo, we introduce an initial prototype for a modular, city-scale sensing platform---the signpost network. The platform, designed to be physically attached to sign posts throughout a city, reduces the burden for sensor and application developers by providing the necessary resources to modules attached to it. Power is provided by harvesting from solar panels with battery storage, with each module allocated a certain subset of the system energy. The signpost platform also provides data storage, long-range communication, data processing, module isolation, and an installation point for connected modules. The signpost acts as a modular base station for researchers, citizen scientists, and other interested parties to deploy custom sensors for applications such as pedestrian counting, air quality monitoring, and RF spectrum sensing at a city-wide scale.},

One of the primary behavioral causes, i.e. dietary intake, is a behavior that science has had little success in understanding, much less affecting. Current behavioral science suggests that family eating dynamics (FED) have high potential to impact child and parent dietary intake and obesity rates. In contrast to traditional obesity related approaches that focus on dietary intakes (e.g., what and how much is being eaten), FED based approaches focus on family mealtime and home food environment (e.g., who is eating, when, where, with whom, interpersonal stress) for modeling behavior and providing feedback that has potential for successful behavior modification.

 abstract = {Recent studies on CTC (cross-technology communication) have demonstrated the possibility of building direct communication between heterogeneous wireless communication technologies, such as WiFi and ZigBee. However, current solutions suffer from significant spectrum usage or limited throughput. To address the issues, this paper presents Transparent Cross-technology Communication (TCTC), a novel CTC technique that establishes a side channel by exploiting today's abundant wireless traffic. The key idea of TCTC is to embed messages in the timings of on-going legacy traffic (e.g., HTTP packets in WiFi), with small and bounded impact on upper-layer applications. Feasibility and effectiveness of our design has been validated via test-bed implementations and experiments on bidirectional communication between WiFi and ZigBee platforms.},

 abstract = {Visible light indoor localization offers promising accuracy and reliability due to dense light deployment and multipath-free propagation. However, current visible light localization schemes rely on either energy-hungry cameras or assumptions about channel responses of light sources, which limits their application. They also require LED lights with specialized circuitry, which increases cost and hinders large scale deployment. We present LiTell2, a scheme that extracts unique features from incumbent fluorescent or LED lights, and uses a simple photodiode sensor to extract AoA information for localization. LiTell2's sensor achieves AoA measurements by leveraging the diversity of photodiodes' angular responses. By comparing signal from photodiodes of different angular response, LiTell2 can derive AoA of each light source, thus achieving high precision localization with unmodified light fixtures and extremely low fingerprinting cost. Our experiments show that LiTell2 provides accurate AoA sensing and enables energy efficient yet robust localization.},

 abstract = {In this demonstration we present Pulsar, a speed-of-light propagation-aware time synchronization platform. Pulsar uses ultra-wideband (UWB) radios for time transfer with each node backed by a chip scale atomic clock (CSAC) that in combination are able to provide accuracy on the order of 10's of nanoseconds for indoor applications. The demonstration will show two Pulsar boards generating a tightly synchronized PPS output that is able to adjust for the distance between the nodes. Even without communication, the devices maintain synchronization over multiple seconds due to a stable CSAC clocking the system.},
