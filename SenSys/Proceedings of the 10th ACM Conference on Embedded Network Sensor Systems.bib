 abstract = {Unprecedented rate of growth in the number of vehicles has resulted in acute road congestion problems worldwide. Better traffic flow management, based on enhanced traffic monitoring, is being tried by city authorities. In many developing countries, the situation is worse because of greater skew in growth of traffic vs the road infrastructure. Further, the existing traffic monitoring techniques perform poorly in the chaotic non-lane based traffic here. In this paper, we present Kyun Queue, a sensor network system for real time traffic queue monitoring. Compared to existing systems, it has several advantages: it (a) works in chaotic traffic, (b) does not interrupt traffic flow during its installation and maintenance and (c) incurs low cost. Our contributions in this paper are four-fold. (1) We propose a new mechanism to sense road occupancy based on variation in RF link characteristics, when line of sight between a transmitter-receiver pair is obstructed. (2) We design algorithms to classify traffic states into congested or free-flowing at time scales of 20 seconds with above 90% accuracy. (3) We design and implement the embedded platforms needed to do the sensing, computation and communication to form a network of sensors. This network can correlate the traffic state classification decisions of individual sensors, to detect multiple levels of traffic congestion or traffic queue length on a given stretch of road, in real time. (4) Deployment of our system on a Mumbai road, after careful consideration of issues like localization and interference, gives correct estimates of traffic queue lengths, validated against 9 hours of image-based ground truth. Our system can provide input to several traffic management applications like traffic light control, incident detection, and congestion monitoring.},

Recently, a practical and efficient implementation of cross-correlation (via sparse approximation) was demonstrated on resource constrained wireless sensor network platforms, where the key idea was to compress the received signal samples, and transfer them to central device where the range information was retrieved by l1-minimization. Although, this mechanism yields accurate ranging results, its applicability is limited due to its slow execution speed and inaccurate recovery of the correlation peak magnitude, which implicitly provides the useful measure of signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we propose Fast Gradient Projection (F-GP), a new l1-minimization algorithm, which overcomes the existing limitations, and provides fast and accurate ranging.},

Whereas typical mobile applications run alone in the foreground interacting with users, sensing applications concurrently run in the background, providing unobtrusive monitoring services. Such concurrent sensing workloads raise a new challenge incurring severe resource contention among themselves and with other foreground applications. To address the challenge, we develop SymPhoney, a coordinated sensing flow execution engine to support concurrent sensing applications. As its key approach, we develop a novel sensing-flow-aware coordination. We first introduce the new concept of frame externalization i.e., to identify and externalize semantic structures embedded in otherwise flat sensing data streams. Leveraging the identified frame structures, SymPhoney develops frame-based coordination and scheduling mechanisms, which effectively coordinates the resource use of concurrent contending applications and maximize their utilities even under severe resource contention. We implemented several sensing applications on top of the SymPhoney engine and performed extensive experiments, showing effective coordination capability of SymPhoney.},

This problem is less of an issue when low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) are deployed homogeneously but with the industrial kickoff and large scale deployments, the interoperability of heterogeneous, standards-compliant implementations will become a significant issue. To address this, we suggest two major changes to IETF RPL (RFC 6550). First we suggest that all storing mode nodes should hold the capability to understand and attach source routing headers that the non-storing mode nodes require to forward packets. Next, we suggest that RPL's non-storing mode nodes should send their destination advertisement messages hop-by-hop, rather than the current end-to-end approach. We show, with two different IPv6 implementations in TinyOS and NanoQplus, that our suggestions high achieve high interoperability performance among different implementations for downwards traffic patterns.},

 abstract = {In this demonstration, we show an indoor location tracking system that broadcasts ranging data to mobile phones using ultrasonic signals. The system capitalizes on the ability for many smart-phones to detect audio above the human hearing range. This approach provides enhanced ranging capabilities to mobile devices without adding to or modifying their hardware. In [1], we describe a modulation scheme based on rate-adaptive wide-band linear frequency modulated chirp pulses that can be transmitted from standard audio tweeters at just above the human hearing frequency range. Acoustic data transmissions (even outside of the human hearing range), typically introduce audible noises (clicks) due to the non-ideal impulse response of speakers. Our scheme is optimized to avoid these artifacts by using slowly changing power-levels and gradual shifts in frequency. Each speaker simultaneously transmits a uniquely identifiably signature that can be geolocated on a map. By then applying a time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) pseudo-ranging technique the mobile devices can localize themselves without synchronizing with the broadcasting infrastructure. This design is not only scalable with respect to the number of transmitters and tracked devices, but also improves user privacy since the mobile device can compute its position locally.},

In one 12-hour trial on a busy road (average daily traffic count 37,000 according to the state DOT), 7,000 unique devices were detected by a single road-side monitoring station, or about 1 device for every 5 vehicles. In this paper, we describe a system for passively tracking unmodified smartphones, based on such Wi-Fi detections. This system uses only common, off-the-shelf access point hardware to both collect and deliver detections. Thus, in addition to high detection rates, it potentially offers very low equipment and installation cost. However, the long range and sparse nature of our opportunistically collected Wi-Fi transmissions presents a significant localization challenge. We propose a trajectory estimation method based on Viterbi's algorithm which takes second-by-second detections of a moving device as input, and produces the most likely spatio-temporal path taken. In addition, we present several methods that prompt passing devices to send additional messages, increasing detection rates an use signal-strength for improved accuracy. Based on our experimental evaluation from one 9-month deployment and several single-day deployments, passive Wi-Fi tracking detects a large fraction of passing smartphones, and produces high-accuracy trajectory estimates.},

However, it is a challenging problem to ensure 100% flooding coverage efficiently considering the combined effects of low-duty-cycle operation and unreliable wireless transmission. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic switching-based reliable flooding (DSRF) framework, which is designed as an enhancement layer to provide efficient and reliable flooding over a variety of existing flooding tree structures in low-duty-cycle WSNs. Through comprehensive simulations, we demonstrate that DSRF can effectively improve both flooding energy efficiency and latency.},

 abstract = {We present DoubleDip, a low power monitoring system for enabling non-intrusive water flow detection. DoubleDip taps into minute thermal gradients in pipes for both replenishing energy reserves and performing low power wakeup. One of the remaining issues with wireless water monitoring in residences and offices is that current solutions require installing sensor nodes with access to electrical wiring or replacing batteries frequently. DoubleDip (DD) significantly extends the lifetime of vibration-based non-intrusive water flow sensors by harvesting thermal energy from hot pipes wherever accessible. DoubleDip requires less than an inch of exposed metal pipe to attach a coupler for gathering sufficient energy to power itself, in some cases, into perpetuity. We observe that water use in homes and offices is incredibly sporadic, making continuous monitoring both impractical and wasteful. Instead, DD puts a thermoelectric harvester into double duty. It uses thermal gradients not only for gathering energy but also for extremely low power (< 1μA) wakeup. In this paper, we describe the DoubleDip design and demonstrate that thermoelectric wakeup is essential for longevity and accuracy. Since DD wakes up from its low power state only when there is a water flow event, it replenishes the energy it uses in sensing and transmitting data by the energy it harvests from the corresponding heat gradient. While DD nodes installed on cold water pipes harvest far less than those installed on hot water pipes, our pilot deployment over four weeks and five locations suggests that thermoelectric wake up is only slightly worse in latency for cold water monitoring and there is sufficient energy harvested from the hot water that it can be shared to extend the lifetime of nearby cold water nodes too.},

 abstract = {Background subtraction is often the first step of many computer vision applications. For a background subtraction method to be useful in embedded camera networks, it must be both accurate and computationally efficient because of the resource constraints on embedded platforms. This makes many traditional background subtraction algorithms unsuitable for embedded platforms because they use complex statistical models to handle subtle illumination changes. These models make them accurate but the computational requirement of these complex models is often too high for embedded platforms. In this paper, we propose a new background subtraction method which is both accurate and computational efficient. The key idea is to use compressive sensing to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the information. By using multiple datasets, we show that the accuracy of our proposed background subtraction method is comparable to that of the traditional background subtraction methods. Moreover, real implementation on an embedded camera platform shows that our proposed method is at least 5 times faster, and consumes significantly less energy and memory resources than the conventional approaches. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method by the implementation and evaluation of an end-to-end real-time embedded camera network target tracking application.},

We provide empirical evidence that the measured heart rate is 75% -- 85% correlated to the ground truth with an average error of 7.5 BPM. The accuracy of the person-specific, 3-class activity level detector is on average 96.8%, where these activity levels are separated based on their differing impacts on heart rate. We demonstrate the practicality of MusicalHeart by deploying it in two real world scenarios and show that MusicalHeart helps the user achieve a desired heart rate intensity with an average error of less than 12.2%, and its quality of recommendation improves over time.},

However, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task due to the notoriously dynamic and unpredictable wireless environment. In this paper, we argue that in addition to the estimation of current link quality, prediction of the future link quality is more important for the routing protocol to establish low cost delivery paths. We propose to apply machine learning methods to predict the link quality in the near future to facilitate the utilization of intermediate links with frequent quality changes. Moreover, we show that by using online learning methods, our adaptive link estimator (TALENT) adapts to network dynamics better than statically trained models without the need of a priori data collection for training the model before deployment. We implemented TALENT in TinyOS with Low-Power Listening (LPL) and conducted extensive experiments in three testbeds. Our experimental results show that the addition of TALENT increases the delivery efficiency 1.95 times on average compared with 4B, the state of the art link quality estimator, as well as improve the end-to-end delivery rate when tested on three different wireless testbeds.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present an indoor ultrasonic location tracking system that can utilize off-the-shelf audio speakers (potentially already in place) to provide fine-grained indoor position data to modern mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. We design and evaluate a communication primitive based on rate-adaptive wide-band linear frequency modulated chirp pulses that utilizes the audio bandwidth just above the human hearing frequency range where mobile devices are still sensitive. Typically transmitting data, even outside of this range, introduces broadband human audible noises (clicks) due to the non-ideal impulse response of speakers. Unlike existing audio modulation schemes, our scheme is optimized based on psychoacoustic properties. For example, all tones exhibit slowly changing power-levels and gradual frequency changes so as to minimize human perceivable artifacts. Chirps also bring the benefit of Pulse Compression, which greatly improves ranging resolution and makes them resilient to both Doppler shifts as well as multi-path propagation that typically plague indoor environments. The scheme also supports the decoding of multiple unique identifier packets being transmitted simultaneously. By applying a Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) pseudo-ranging technique the mobile devices can localize themselves without tight out-of-band synchronization with the broadcasting infrastructure. This design is not only scalable with respect to the number of transmitters and tracked devices, but also improves user privacy since the mobile devices compute their positions locally. We show through user studies and experimentation on smartphones that we are able to provide sub-meter (95% < 10cm) accurate indoor positioning in a manner that is imperceptible to humans.},

To solve the conflict between the capability limitations of existing systems and the ever-growing demands of roadway safety oriented communication applications, we propose a novel system design and implementation for realtime warnings of roadway hazards, e.g., physical hazards such as puddles, rocks, and pits on the road, and behavioral hazards such as lane changing, speeding, careless left-turn, etc. Specifically, our demo aims to provide hazard sensing and warnings to users close to a hazard on the road in a realtime and reliable manner. In our extensive experimental study, the latency is well controlled within the hard realtime requirement (100ms) for roadway safety applications given by NHTSA, and the reliability is proved to be improved by two orders of magnitude compared with existing experimental results [1]. To our best knowledge, it is the first system for roadway safety applications that provides guaranteed highly reliable packet delivery ratio of 99% within the strict hard-realtime requirement 100ms under various scenarios, e.g., highways, city areas, rural areas, tunnels, bridges. Even in the worst case that burst warnings coming from multiple neighboring vehicles at the same time, the experimental results still show that the system is able to stably receive 99% warning messages within the hard realtime requirement 100ms. Our design can be widely applied for roadway safety applications and facilitate the current research in both hardware and software design and further provide an opportunity to consolidate the existing work on a practical and easy-configurable low-cost roadway safety oriented system.},

Constructing the model can naturally be performed by a service running in the cloud, but users may be more inclined to contribute training samples if the privacy of these data could be ensured. Thus, in this paper, we focus on privacy-preserving collaborative learning for the mobile setting, which addresses several competing challenges not previously considered in the literature: supporting complex classification methods like support vector machines, respecting mobile computing and communication constraints, and enabling user-determined privacy levels. Our approach, Pickle, ensures classification accuracy even in the presence of significantly perturbed training samples, is robust to methods that attempt to infer the original data or poison the model, and imposes minimal costs. We validate these claims using a user study, many real-world datasets and two different implementations of Pickle.},

@inproceedings{Puccinelli:2012:BCP:2426656.2426660,
 abstract = {Asynchronous low-power listening techniques reduce the energy footprint of radio communication by enforcing link layer duty cycling. At the same time, these techniques make broadcast traffic significantly more expensive than unicast traffic. Because broadcast is a key network primitive and is widely used in various protocols, recently several techniques have been proposed to reduce the amount of broadcast activity by merging broadcasts from different protocols. In this paper we focus on collection protocols and investigate the more extreme approach of eliminating broadcast completely. To this end, we design, implement and, evaluate a Broadcast-Free Collection Protocol, BFC. We derive first-order models to quantify the costs of broadcasts, and evaluate the performance of BFC on a public testbed. Compared to the Collection Tree Protocol, the de facto standard for data collection, BFC achieves double-digit percentage improvements on the duty cycles. The specific benefits to individual nodes depend on the relative cost of unicast activity; we show that the nodes that benefit the most are the sink's neighbors, which are crucial for network lifetime extension. Eliminating broadcast also brings several other advantages, including extra flexibility with link layer calibrations and energy savings in the presence of poor connectivity.},

Traces generated by such techniques can become large, defying the harsh resource constraints of WSNs. Compression is a straightforward candidate to reduce trace sizes, yet is challenged by the same resource constraints. Established trace compression algorithms perform unsatisfactorily under these constraints. We propose Prius, a novel hybrid (offline/online) trace compression technique that enables application of established trace compression algorithms for WSNs and achieves high compression rates and significant energy savings. We have implemented such hybrid versions of two established compression techniques for TinyOS and evaluated them on various applications. Prius respects the resource constraints of WSNs (5% average program memory overhead) whilst reducing energy consumption on average by 46% and 49% compared to straightforward online adaptations of established compression algorithms and the state-of-the-art trace-specific compression algorithm respectively.},

 abstract = {In wireless mobile networks, energy can be saved by using dynamic transmission scheduling with pre-knowledge about channel conditions. Such pre-knowledge can be obtained via profiling as proposed by several existing systems which assumed that the existence of spatial link correlation makes the measured channel status at one location reusable over a long period of time. Our empirical data, however, tells a different story: spatial link correlation only maintains well within a short duration (from seconds to tens of seconds) while decreases significantly afterwards, a phenomena we call ephemeral link correlation. By leveraging this observation, we design and implement a real-time transmission scheduling system, named PreSeer, on the railway platform for cargo transportation, where the transmission of a sink (to cellular towers) can be scheduled intelligently by utilizing future channel status measured by sinks located in front of it on the same train. We have implemented and evaluated the PreSeer system on the collected data extensively over 7,000-kilometer railway routes during a period of one and half years. Results reveal that PreSeer can help save as much as 40% energy, comparing with three base-line algorithms. More importantly, lessons learned from this major effort provide useful guidelines for transmission scheduling in highly-dynamic mobile environments, where (i) channel measurements cannot be perfectly aligned due to varying vehicle velocities, and (ii) the accuracy of channel measurements is subject to hardware discrepancy as well as environment irregularity.},

These properties make the AudioDAQ design more universal, so it works across a broad range of phones including sophisticated smart phones and simpler feature phones, enables simple analog peripherals without requiring a microcontroller, requires no hardware or software modifications on the phone itself, uses significantly less power than prior approaches, and allows continuous data capture over an extended period of time. The AudioDAQ design is efficient because it draws all necessary power from the microphone bias voltage, and it is general because this voltage and a voice memo application are present on most mobile phones in use today.

Our model and inference procedures can be used to analyze traffic patterns and conditions from historical data, as well as to infer current patterns and conditions from data collected in real-time. As such, our techniques provide a powerful new sensor network approach for traffic visualization, analysis, and urban planning.},

 abstract = {As the number of sensors increase in wireless sensing applications, it is important for nodes to provide meaningful summary reports of the original data to the gateway. In doing so, given the resource constraints of the sensing devices, we need a light weight, yet, effective scheme to minimize the number of reports at the sensors while preserving the accuracy of the original data. However, we show in this work that unlike outdoors environments where various sensors may show a similar phenomena (e.g., high spatial correlation), this may not be true for sensors deployed in a typical indoors environment. To resolve this issue, we introduce a data summarizing scheme for such indoor applications that combines two techniques. First, our scheme detects events in a data stream by comparing the short term mean of the recent measurements with the most recent report sent to the gateway. Second, we include an exponentially increasing/decreasing timer that triggers additional reports where the timer's interval is reconfigured dynamically with respect to the result of our event detection method. Evaluations with temperature and humidity data collected in an indoors environment indicate that our scheme significantly reduces the number of transmissions while maintaining a mean error as low as ~0.07°C and ~0.08%RH.},

 abstract = {Developing, testing, debugging, and evaluating communication protocols for low-power wireless networks is a long and cumbersome task. Simulators can be helpful in the early stages of development, but their models of hardware components and the wireless channel are often rather simplistic and hence cannot substitute experiments on real sensor node platforms. The resources available on common platforms are however very limited, and so are the possibilities for non-intrusive debugging and testing. With most existing testbeds it is only possible to collect information from the serial port, which requires adding highly intrusive logging statements that alter the timing behavior of the software running on the nodes. This is particularly detrimental to the operation of time-critical components, such as radio drivers, media access control (MAC) protocols, and certain flooding protocols [2], hindering their testbed-assisted development.},

 abstract = {Biking is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly ways to control weight and commute. To precisely estimate caloric expenditure, bikers have to install a bike computer or use a smartphone connected to additional sensors such as heart rate monitors worn on their chest, or cadence sensors mounted on their bikes. However, these peripherals are still expensive and inconvenient for daily use. This work poses the following question: is it possible to use just a smartphone to reliably estimate cycling activity? We answer this question positively through a pocket sensing approach that can reliably measure cadence using the phone's on-board accelerometer with less than 2% error. Our method estimates caloric expenditure through a model that takes as inputs GPS traces, the USGS elevation service, and the detailed road database from OpenStreetMap. The overall caloric estimation error is 60% smaller than other smartphone-based approaches. Finally, the smartphone can aggressively duty-cycle its GPS receiver, reducing energy consumption by 57%, without any degradation in the accuracy of caloric expenditure estimates. This is possible because we can recover the bike's route, even with fewer GPS location samples, using map information from the USGS and OpenStreetMap databases.},

 abstract = {Device-free passive localization (DfP) techniques can localize human subjects without wearing a radio tag. Being convenient and private, DfP can find many applications in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. Unfortunately, DfP techniques need frequent manual recalibration of the radio signal values, which can be cumbersome and costly. We present SenCam, a sensor-camera collaboration solution that conducts automatic recalibration by leveraging existing surveillance camera(s). When the camera detects a subject, it can periodically trigger recalibration and update the radio signal data accordingly. This technique requires camera access occasionally each month, minimizing computational costs and reducing privacy concerns when compared to localization techniques solely based on cameras. Through experiments in an open indoor space, we show that this scheme can retain good localization results while avoiding manual recalibration.},

After establishing the correctness of our proposed algorithm, we evaluate its performance in testbed experiments using CTP and Dozer, two well-known data collection protocols. Foremost interested in obtaining a better understanding of the performance of long-term real-world deployments, Multi-hop Network Tomography (MNT) is applied to in total more than 140 million packets that have been obtained from three multi-year WSN deployments of the PermaSense project.

 abstract = {As a supporting primitive of many mobile device applications, neighbor discovery identifies nearby devices so that they can exchange information and collaborate in a peer-to-peer manner. To date, discovery schemes trade a long latency for energy efficiency and require a collaborative duty cycle pattern, and thus they are not suitable for interactive mobile applications where a user is unable to configure others' devices. In this paper, we propose Acc, which serves as an on-demand generic discovery accelerating middleware for many existing neighbor discovery schemes. Acc leverages the discovery capabilities of neighbor devices, supporting both direct and indirect neighbor discoveries. Our evaluations show that Acc-assisted discovery schemes reduce latency by a maximum of 51.8%, compared with the schemes consuming the same amount of energy. We further present and evaluate a Crowd-Alert application where Acc can be employed by taxi drivers to accelerate selection of a direction with fewer competing taxis and more potential passengers, based on a 10 GB dataset of more than 15,000 taxis in a metropolitan area.},
