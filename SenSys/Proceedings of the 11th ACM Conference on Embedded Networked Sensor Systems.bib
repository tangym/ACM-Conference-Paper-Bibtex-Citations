 abstract = {Crowdsourced video often provides engaging and diverse perspectives not captured by professional videographers. Broad appeal of user-uploaded video has been widely confirmed: freely distributed on YouTube, by subscription on Vimeo, and to peers on Facebook/Google+. Unfortunately, user-generated multimedia can be difficult to organize; these services depend on manual "tagging" or machine-mineable viewer comments. While manual indexing can be effective for popular, well-established videos, newer content may be poorly searchable; live video need not apply. We envisage video-sharing services for live user video streams, indexed automatically and in realtime, especially by shared content. We propose FOCUS, for Hadoop-on-cloud video-analytics. FOCUS uniquely leverages visual, 3D model reconstruction and multimodal sensing to decipher and continuously track a video's line-of-sight. Through spatial reasoning on the relative geometry of multiple video streams, FOCUS recognizes shared content even when viewed from diverse angles and distances. In a 70-volunteer user study, FOCUS' clustering correctness is roughly comparable to humans.},

To reduce HVAC energy use, prior studies have proposed using wireless occupancy sensors or even cameras for occupancy based actuation showing energy savings of up to 42%. However, most of these solutions require these sensors and the associated network to be designed, deployed, tested and maintained within existing buildings which is significantly costly. We present Sentinel, a system that leverages existing WiFi infrastructure in commercial buildings along with smartphones with WiFi connectivity carried by building occupants to provide fine-grained occupancy based HVAC actuation. We have implemented Sentinel on top of RESTful web services, and demonstrate that it is scalable and compatible with legacy building management. We show that Sentinel accurately determines the occupancy in office spaces 86% of the time, with 6.2% false negative errors. We high-light the reasons for the inaccuracies, mostly attributed to aggressive power management by smartphones. Finally, we actuate 23% of the HVAC zones within a commercial building using Sentinel for one day and measure HVAC electrical energy savings of 17.8%.},

Reductions in application data traffic as high as two orders of magnitude can be achieved.

The study reported here reveals that careful, coordinated network parameter tuning can leverage the reduced traffic of forecasting techniques to increase lifetime without compromising application performance.},

We report in this demo a self-sustaining indoor sensing system. First of all, given the pervasive operation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems indoors, our system harvests energy from airflow introduced by the HVAC systems to power each sensor node. Secondly, as the harvested power is tiny (only of hundreds of μW) such that the exiting sensor products cannot be afforded due to their high energy consumption, we exploit the feature of our harvester to sense the airflow speed in an energy-free manner, which can pay back the environment by enhancing the awareness of the indoor microclimate. We also present two complementary algorithms to synchronize the duty-cycles of the sensor nodes to adapt to the energy harvesting. To our knowledge, this is the first indoor wireless sensing system that encapsulates energy harvesting, network operating, and sensing all together.},

However making sense and acting on these multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data streams requires iterative and intensive exploration of the datasets, and development of customized analysis techniques that are appropriate for a particular health domain. Lifestreams is a modular and extensible open-source data analysis stack designed to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of personal data stream sense-making. Lifestreams analysis modules include: feature extraction from raw data; feature selection; pattern and trend inference; and interactive visualization. The system was iteratively designed during a 6-month pilot in which 44 young mothers used an open-source participatory mHealth platform to record both self-report and passive data about their diet, stress and exercise. Feedback as participants and the study coordinator attempted to use the Lifestreams dashboard to make sense of their data collected during this intensive study were critical inputs into the design process. In order to explore the generality and extensibility of Lifestreams pipeline, it was then applied to two additional studies with different datasets, including a continuous stream of audio data, self-report data, and mobile system analytics. In all three studies, Lifestreams' integrated analysis pipeline was able to identify key behaviors and trends in the data that were not otherwise identified by participants.},

Previous work has shown that opportunistic routing can achieve low-latency data collection in duty-cycled networks. However, applications are now considered where nodes are not only periodic data sources, but rather addressable end points generating traffic with arbitrary patterns. We present ORPL, an opportunistic routing protocol that supports any-to-any, on-demand traffic. ORPL builds upon RPL, the standard protocol for low-power IPv6 networks. By combining RPL's tree-like topology with opportunistic routing, ORPL forwards data to any destination based on the mere knowledge of the nodes' sub-tree. We use bitmaps and Bloom filters to represent and propagate this information in a space-efficient way, making ORPL scale to large networks of addressable nodes. Our results in a 135-node testbed show that ORPL outperforms a number of state-of-the-art solutions including RPL and CTP, conciliating a sub-second latency and a sub-percent duty cycle. ORPL also increases robustness and scalability, addressing the whole network reliably through a 64-byte Bloom filter, where RPL needs kilobytes of routing tables for the same task.},

We introduce Chaos, the first primitive that natively supports all-to-all data sharing in low-power wireless networks. Different from current approaches, Chaos embeds programmable in-network processing into a communication support based on synchronous transmissions. We show that this design enables a variety of common all-to-all interactions, including network-wide agreement and data aggregation. Results from three testbeds and simulations demonstrate that Chaos scales efficiently to networks consisting of hundreds of nodes, achieving severalfold improvements over LWB and CTP/Drip in radio duty cycle and latency with almost 100 % reliability across all scenarios we tested. For example, Chaos computes simple aggregates, such as the maximum, in a 100-node multi-hop network within less than 90 milliseconds.},

@inproceedings{Wei:2013:RCV:2517351.2517357,
 abstract = {Acoustic Sensor Networks (ASNs) have a wide range of applications in natural and urban environment monitoring, as well as indoor activity monitoring. In-network classification is critically important in ASNs because wireless transmission costs several orders of magnitude more energy than computation. The main challenges of in-network classification in ASNs include effective feature selection, intensive computation requirement and high noise levels. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse representation based feature-less, low computational cost, and noise resilient framework for in-network classification in ASNs. The key component of Sparse Approximation based Classification (SAC), &ell;1 minimization, is a convex optimization problem, and is known to be computationally expensive. Furthermore, SAC algorithms assumes that the test samples are a linear combination of a few training samples in the training sets. For acoustic applications, this results in a very large training dictionary, making the computation infeasible to be performed on resource constrained ASN platforms. Therefore, we propose several techniques to reduce the size of the problem, so as to fit SAC for in-network classification in ASNs. Our extensive evaluation using two real-life datasets (consisting of calls from 14 frog species and 20 cricket species respectively) shows that the proposed SAC framework outperforms conventional approaches such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Moreover, our SAC approach can deal with multi-label classification which is common in ASNs. Finally, we explore the system design spaces and demonstrate the real-time feasibility of the proposed framework by the implementation and evaluation of an acoustic classification application on an embedded ASN testbed.},

 abstract = {Obtaining a detailed, whole-house breakdown of energy usage would allow for homeowners to better understand their energy consumption and opportunities for energy savings. Current solutions are either too course-grained, too difficult to deploy, not networked, or offer incomplete coverage of hard to meter items, such as ceiling lights. We demonstrate a wirelessly networked, energy-harvesting power metering system that draws zero standby power and is power proportional to the load it is metering. The system is comprised of three different meters: one for plugged in loads, one for panel level circuits, and one for hard to sense loads, such as ceiling lights. Each meter harvests energy proportionally to the load its measuring and powers a sensor node intermittently. At each activation the node increments a counter and periodically the node transmits a wireless packet containing that counter. Because the activation rate is proportional to the power draw of the load, the packet receiver can determine the power of the load based on the wakeup rate. Together, these sensors create multiple data streams which are aggregated by a receiver. When combined with a calibrated meter that measures total household power, our system can iteratively determine the contributions of each load to the total power usage, allowing users to gain a broad yet detailed view of their energy consumption and costs.},

A client app sends intermittent, coarse-grained measurements to a server, which correlates higher expected energy use with client properties like the running apps, device model, and operating system. The analysis quantifies the error and confidence associated with a diagnosis, suggests actions the user could take to improve battery life, and projects the amount of improvement. During a deployment to a community of more than 500,000 devices, Carat diagnosed thousands of energy anomalies in the wild. Carat detected all synthetically injected anomalies, produced no known instances of false positives, projected the battery impact of anomalies with 95% accuracy, and, on average, increased a user's battery life by 11% after 10 days (compared with 1.9% for the control group).},

While GPS provides accurate outdoor locations, accurate indoor localization schemes still require either additional infrastructure support (e.g., ranging devices) or extensive training before system deployment (e.g., WiFi signal fingerprinting). In order to help existing localization systems to overcome their limitations or to further improve their accuracy, we propose Social-Loc, a middleware that takes the potential locations for individual users, which is estimated by any underlying indoor localization system as input and exploits both social encounter and non-encounter events to cooperatively calibrate the estimation errors. We have fully implemented Social-Loc on the Android platform and demonstrated its performance on two underlying indoor localization systems: Dead-reckoning and WiFi fingerprint. Experiment results show that Social-Loc improves user's localization accuracy of WiFi fingerprint and dead-reckoning by at least 22% and 37%, respectively. Large-scale simulation results indicate Social-Loc is scalable, provides good accuracy for a long duration of time, and is robust against measurement errors.},

The board design is driven by cost-efficiency of the testbed instrumentation and provides access to the on-chip debug port of the sensor node's processor. We focus on three main debugging modalities: (i) non-intrusive network-wide tracing of the internal state of individual nodes; (ii) synchronous stopping of the whole network on a breakpoint; and (iii) distributed assertion checking.

Modeling the protocol operation as a function of network state is difficult as the state is frequently updated in an uncoordinated fashion. Recent protocols use synchronous transmissions (ST): multiple nodes send simultaneously towards the same receiver, as opposed to pairwise link-based transmissions (LT). ST enable efficient multi-hop protocols with little network state. We studied whether ST in Glossy enable simple yet accurate protocol modeling [10]. Based on extensive testbed experiments and statistical analyses, we found that: (i) unlike LT, packet receptions and losses with ST largely adhere to a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli trials; (ii) this property greatly simplifies accurately modeling ST-based protocols, as we demonstrated by obtaining model errors below 0.25% in energy for the Glossy-based Low-Power Wireless Bus (LWB).},

Effortless content sharing might be the most important application, but we can also use it to provide business card information for attendees, feed information into calendar applications to simplify scheduling of follow-up meetings, populate the membership of collaborative editing applications, mailing lists, and social networks, and perform many other tasks. We have developed a system that uses audio sensing to maintain meeting membership automatically. We choose audio since hearing the same conversation provides a human-centric notion of attending the same gathering. It takes into account walls and other sound barriers between otherwise closely situated people. It can sense participants attending remotely by teleconference. It does not require attendees to perform any explicit action when participants leave a meeting for which they should no longer have access to associated content. It works indoors and outdoors and does not require pre-populating databases with mapping information. For sensors, we require only the commonly available microphones on mobile devices. Our system exploits a new technique for matching sensed patterns of relative audio silence, or silence signatures, from mobile devices (mobile phones, tablets, laptops) to determine device co-location. A signature based on simple silence patterns rather than a detailed audio characterization reveals less information about the content of potentially private conversations and is also more robustly compared across devices that are not clock synchronized. We evaluate our method in formal indoor meetings and teleconferences and in ad hoc gatherings outdoors and in a noisy cafeteria. Across all our tests so far, our approach determines audio co-location with a worst-case accuracy of 96%, and recovery from these errors takes only a few seconds. We also describe a content sharing application supported by silence signature matching, the limitations of our approach, current status, and future plans.},

The conversation clustering algorithm proposed is able to detect fine-grain conversation groups even if speakers are close together. Finally, to address energy constrain, a POMDP-based energy control scheme is incorporated. We evaluate the performance of each component in SocialWeaver using more than 100 hours of conversation data collected from conversation groups with sizes ranging from 2 to 13. Evaluation shows that accuracy of 71% to 92% can be achieved for various conversation modes and up to 50% of the energy consumption in SocialWeaver can be reduced through the POMDP-based scheme. Evaluations of SocialWeaver in both controlled and uncontrolled settings show promising results in realistic settings and potential to enable many future applications.},

 abstract = {Energy management, and in particular its efficient optimization, is one of the hot trends in the current days, both at the enterprise level (optimization of whole corporate/government buildings) and single-citizens' homes. Energy efficiency is generally function of out-door techniques -- renewable energy, smart energy production and distribution, etc. -- and in-door techniques; in particular, very few energy managers -- each of us can be an energy manager of his own home - can state "who, when and why is consuming", conversely this knowledge is fundamental in order to diminish wasting of energy. Recent studies show that the energy wasted in the overall consumption is about the 30% of the total amount; examples of potential energy wasting are printers and PCs on during the night, status LED of different devices (TV, set-top-box, etc.) and/or lights, lights during normal day-light time, etc.},

 abstract = {Despite the continuous research to facilitate WSNs development, most safety analysis and mitigation efforts in concurrency are still left to developers, who must manage synchronization and shared memory explicitly. In this paper, we present a system language that ensures safe concurrency by handling threats at compile time, rather than at runtime. Based on the synchronous programming model, our design allows for a simple reasoning about concurrency that enables compile-time analysis resulting in deterministic and memory-safe programs. As a trade-off, our design imposes limitations on the language expressiveness, such as doing computationally-intensive operations and meeting hard real-time responsiveness. To show that the achieved expressiveness and responsiveness is sufficient for a wide range of WSN applications, we implement widespread network protocols and the CC2420 radio driver. The implementations show a reduction in source code size, with a penalty of memory increase below 10% in comparison to nesC. Overall, we ensure safety properties for programs relying on high-level control abstractions that also lead to concise and readable code.},

 abstract = {Automation and monitoring systems for industrial and commercial sites (short: Site Management Systems) often grow organically, hence they need to be able to integrate large numbers of heterogeneous devices, based on both legacy and novel tools and systems. Currently, many standards are used in the site management field for both control (e.g., KNX, BACNet, LON) and communication (e.g., WiFi, Ethernet). Different systems are responsible for different tasks and parts of the site. Since they are usually not designed to interoperate, the site manager is forced to choose one that suits most of her needs, forgoing features offered by alternative solutions. I.e, the flexibility of the site manager is limited. Moreover, site management systems often require technical personnel for installation, calibration and configuration, and are not designed to be modified frequently to adapt to changes. Because of this, the site manager is discouraged from changing the settings of the system or from adding or updating devices, by lack of technical knowledge and by high costs. In other words, a site management system that makes adding new devices, e.g., solar panels, as easy as plugging in and using a webcam is needed.},

For realizing our proposal, we modified Android OS itself, and developed two applications that run on Android OS. In the former, we uniquely modified SensorManager of Android OS for supporting an external sensors. In the latter, we made a virtualizing application for each embedded sensors that sends a value to other terminals via Bluetooth. Also, we developed a control application of our function itself. Through our demo using "Penguin Skiing 3D", we show that an acceleration sensor is successfully virtualized and is behaving as a local sensor of another terminal. In addition, we evaluate the affect of a sampling interval and a cache update interval at a remote terminal against the accuracy at a local terminal.},

@inproceedings{DeBruin:2013:MEE:2517351.2517363,
 abstract = {Conventional AC power meters perform at least two distinct functions: power conversion, to supply the meter itself, and energy metering, to measure the load consumption. This paper presents Monjolo, a new energy-metering architecture that combines these two functions to yield a new design point in the metering space. The key insight underlying this work is that the output of a current transformer -- nominally used to measure a load current -- can be harvested and used to intermittently power a wireless sensor node. The hypothesis is that the node's activation frequency increases monotonically with the primary load's draw, making it possible to estimate load power from the interval between activations, assuming the node consumes a fixed energy quanta during each activation. This paper explores this thesis by designing, implementing, and evaluating the Monjolo metering architecture. The results demonstrate that it is possible to build a meter that draws zero-power under zero-load conditions, offers high accuracy for near-unity power factor loads, works with non-unity power factor loads in combination with a whole-house meter, wirelessly reports readings to a data aggregator, is resilient to communication failures, and is parsimonious with the radio channel, even under heavy loads. Monjolo eliminates the high-voltage AC-DC power supply and AC metering circuitry present in earlier designs, enabling a smaller, simpler, safer, and lower-cost design point that supports novel deployment scenarios like non-intrusive circuit-level metering.},

To analyse the coverage of a building, WSN-Maintain takes as input the floorplan of the building, the coverage requirement of each region and the locations of sensor nodes. We take account of the heterogeneity of device specifications in terms of communication capability and sensing coverage. WSN-Maintain is run in parallel with the collect-view tool of Contiki, which was integrated into the Cooja simulator. We show that WSN-Maintain is able to automatically turn on redundant nodes to maintain the coverage requirement when active nodes fail and report failures that require physical maintenance.

 abstract = {Carpooling has long held the promise of reducing gas consumption by decreasing mileage to deliver co-riders. Although ad hoc carpools already exist in the real world through private arrangements, little research on the topic has been done. In this paper, we present the first systematic work to design, implement, and evaluate a carpool service, called coRide, in a large-scale taxicab network intended to reduce total mileage for less gas consumption. Our coRide system consists of three components, a dispatching cloud server, passenger clients, and an onboard customized device, called TaxiBox. In the coRide design, in response to the delivery requests of passengers, dispatching cloud servers calculate cost-efficient carpool routes for taxicab drivers and thus lower fares for the individual passengers. To improve coRide's efficiency in mileage reduction, we formulate a NP-hard route calculation problem under different practical constraints. We then provide (i) an optimal algorithm using Linear Programming, (ii) a 2 approximation algorithm with a polynomial complexity, and (iii) its corresponding online version. To encourage coRide's adoption, we present a win-win fare model as the incentive mechanism for passengers and drivers to participate. We evaluate coRide with a real world dataset of more than 14,000 taxicabs, and the results show that compared with the ground truth, our service can reduce 33% of total mileage; with our win-win fare model, we can lower passenger fares by 49% and simultaneously increase driver profit by 76%.},

In this use-case bandwidth usage is the main concern for the sensor gateway whereas usage of power which is directly impacted by overall bandwidth consumption is a key factor in case of mobile phone used as sensor gateway. We have reduced communication cost and optimized resource usage in terms of energy and bandwidth which are essential for any constrained sensor gateway by adapting characteristics of CoAP as mentioned above.

 abstract = {We present our ongoing work on the design of macroprogramming abstractions to program sensing and actuating applications using robot swarms. Robots can sample the environment and act on it where no other sensor can reach, e.g., to monitor the environment at altitude with aerial robots. Programming the individual behavior of multiple coordinating robots is difficult. We design LiftOff, a macroprogramming abstraction that allows to program robot swarms collectively, by creating the illusion of a single computing device that occupies the entire physical space of interest. We achieve this by giving variables and values in a programming language a spatial semantics. In LiftOff, values may be associated to a location, and programmers use the same variable to access different values at different locations, sparing the need to manually create a mapping from variables to spatial values. LiftOff applications execute synchronously or based on lazy evaluation. The former allows precise program analysis, e.g., using model checking, whilst the latter potentially executes faster. In this paper, we report on LiftOff's initial design and prototypes.},

The system relies on a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm, which serve to train personalized gestures and also to recognize them real-time. The trained set of gestures is available for consumer applications to include this type of interaction in their functionalities. In particular, we describe a consumer application that enables to configure and orchestrate different controllable smart objects. Each object provides a list of configurable actions that it can perform, thus the user may match each action with his preferred gesture. In execution time, a user may control the desired object just by pressing the object name; additionally, the user can retrieve the existing configuration, reconfigure it and train new gestures.

@inproceedings{Lane:2013:PCE:2517351.2517372,
 abstract = {Fueled by the widespread adoption of sensor-enabled smartphones, mobile crowdsourcing is an area of rapid innovation. Many crowd-powered sensor systems are now part of our daily life -- for example, providing highway congestion information. However, participation in these systems can easily expose users to a significant drain on already limited mobile battery resources. For instance, the energy burden of sampling certain sensors (such as WiFi or GPS) can quickly accumulate to levels users are unwilling to bear. Crowd system designers must minimize the negative energy side-effects of participation if they are to acquire and maintain large-scale user populations. To address this challenge, we propose Piggyback CrowdSensing (PCS), a system for collecting mobile sensor data from smartphones that lowers the energy overhead of user participation. Our approach is to collect sensor data by exploiting Smartphone App Opportunities -- that is, those times when smartphone users place phone calls or use applications. In these situations, the energy needed to sense is lowered because the phone need no longer be woken from an idle sleep state just to collect data. Similar savings are also possible when the phone either performs local sensor computation or uploads the data to the cloud. To efficiently use these sporadic opportunities, PCS builds a lightweight, user-specific prediction model of smartphone app usage. PCS uses this model to drive a decision engine that lets the smartphone locally decide which app opportunities to exploit based on expected energy/quality trade-offs. We evaluate PCS by analyzing a large-scale dataset (containing 1,320 smartphone users) and building an end-to-end crowdsourcing application that constructs an indoor WiFi localization database. Our findings show that PCS can effectively collect large-scale mobile sensor datasets (e.g., accelerometer, GPS, audio, image) from users while using less energy (up to 90% depending on the scenario) compared to a representative collection of existing approaches.},

Current sleep monitoring systems are often difficult to use and hence limited to sleep clinics, or invasive to users, e.g., requiring users to wear a device during sleep. This paper presents iSleep -- a practical system to monitor an individual's sleep quality using off-the-shelf smartphone. iSleep uses the built-in microphone of the smartphone to detect the events that are closely related to sleep quality, including body movement, couch and snore, and infers quantitative measures of sleep quality. iSleep adopts a lightweight decision-tree-based algorithm to classify various events based on carefully selected acoustic features, and tracks the dynamic ambient noise characteristics to improve the robustness of classification. We have evaluated iSleep based on the experiment that involves 7 participants and total 51 nights of sleep, as well the data collected from real iSleep users. Our results show that iSleep achieves consistently above 90% accuracy for event classification in a variety of different settings. By providing a fine-grained sleep profile that depicts details of sleep-related events, iSleep allows the user to track the sleep efficiency over time and relate irregular sleep patterns to possible causes.},

Due to the limited size of equipped screens, scrolling operations are indispensable in order to display the content of interest on screen. While power consumption caused by hardware and software installed within smartphones is well studied, the energy cost made by human-screen interaction such as scrolling remains unknown. In this paper, we analyze the impact of scrolling operations to the power consumption of smartphones, finding that the state-of-art strategy of smartphones in responding a scrolling operation is to always use the highest frame rate which arouses huge computation burden and can contribute nearly 50% to the total power consumption of smartphones. In recognizing this significance, we further propose a novel system, Energy-Efficient Engine(E3), which automatically tracks the scrolling speed and adaptively adjusts the frame rate according to individual user preference. The goal of E3 is to guarantee the user experience and minimize the energy consumption caused by scrolling at the same time. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of E3 design. On average, E3 can save up to 58% of the energy consumed by CPU and 34% of the overall energy consumption.},

 abstract = {Background. Real time urban traffic information is critical to wide populations living in the city but undergoes significant spatial and temporal variation especially in the urban areas and calls for well monitoring. For the past decades, increasing efforts have been put into exploring an accurate, efficient, and inexpensive way to instantly monitor the urban traffic conditions. Conventional methods rely on intrusive sensing, where people deploy infrastructural devices like loop detectors or traffic cameras at roadsides to actively detect traffic references. Installing such intrusive devices incurs substantial deployment and maintenance costs and can only provide limited observation at sparse positions. Recent studies resort to the GPS traces collected from "probe vehicles" like taxis or private cars to estimate the road traffic conditions [2, 5]. Such a passive probing method avoids cumbrous infrastructure deployment and enjoys flexible information extraction from the running probes in the city. Nevertheless, most of them largely rely on full cooperation from the probe vehicles and bear substantial cost in obtaining their location references.},

Our tool uses parameters, e.g. RSSI and LQI, transmitted with every received packet to profile the links between nodes and their corresponding neighborhood.

An ultrasonic triggering mechanism has been recently developed for VirtualSense, an ultra-low-power sensor node featuring a Java runtime environment. Ultrasonic triggers provide on-demand wakeup capabilities that can be exploited by routing nodes to be switched on whenever there is a packet to be routed towards the sink, while spending all the idle time in an ultra low power inactive state where even the radio module is turned off. In addition, the same hardware components can be used to perform pairwise distance measurements that can be exploited for localization.

 abstract = {Whereas a lot of efforts have been put on energy conservation in wireless sensor networks, the limited lifetime of these systems still hampers their practical deployments. This situation is further exacerbated indoors, as conventional energy harvesting (e.g., solar) ceases to work. To enable long-lived indoor sensing, we report in this paper a self-sustaining sensing system that draws energy from indoor environments, adapts its duty-cycle to the harvested energy, and pays back the environment by enhancing the awareness of the indoor microclimate through an "energy-free" sensing. First of all, given the pervasive operation of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems indoors, our system harvests energy from airflow introduced by the HVAC systems to power each sensor node. Secondly, as the harvested power is tiny (only of hundreds of μW), an extremely low but synchronous duty-cycle has to be applied whereas the system gets no energy surplus to support existing synchronization schemes. So we design two complementary synchronization schemes that cost virtually no energy. Finally, we exploit the feature of our harvester to sense the airflow speed (which can be used to infer the indoor microclimate) in an energy-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first indoor wireless sensing system that encapsulates energy harvesting, network operating, and sensing all together.},

 abstract = {Location information about mobile devices can reveal movement patterns of people wearing them. We present a cross-technology approach to track Wi-Fi enabled smartphones using a ZigBee sensor network. Implementing such a system on resource constrained low-power sensor nodes requires means to efficiently process signal strength measurements. We propose a new method to recognize Wi-Fi probe requests on devices that are unable to decode Wi-Fi packets. Initial experiments on a testbed show that it is possible to localize unmodified phones within a building using signal strength measurements.},

 abstract = {Buildings are often inefficiently conditioned. Rooms that are empty are needlessly conditioned and partially filled rooms are conditioned assuming maximum occupancy. In this demonstration, we describe a system that reduces energy consumption by opportunistically reducing energy consumption based on room usage; we only condition rooms currently occupied and condition the space based on real-time occupancy measurements. We will show how a thermal sensor array can be used measure occupancy in real-time and how this occupancy information can be integrated with a real building management system in order to control the heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting of a building to optimize energy usage.},

 abstract = {We present Mirage, a non body contact technique to infer the amount and type of body motion, gesture, and activity. This approach involves passive measurement of static electric field of the environment flowing through sense electrode. This sensing method leverages electric field distortion by the presence of an intruder (e.g. human body). Mirage sensor has simple analog circuitry, supports ultra-low power operation, and requires no instrumentation to the user. We illustrate the utility of Mirage with a demonstration of real-time interactive applications including activity monitoring and games which allow the users to interact with a computer using body motion.},

Kintense uses a combination of: (1) an array of supervised learners to recognize a predefined set of aggressive actions, (2) an unsupervised learner to discover new aggressive actions or refine existing actions, and (3) human feedback to reduce false alarms and to label potential aggressive actions. This abstract provides an overview of the design and implementation of Kintense and provides empirical evidence that Kintense is 11% -- 16% more accurate when compared to standard techniques such as dynamic time warping (DTW) and posture based gesture recognizers.},

@inproceedings{Mandel:2013:PEC:2517351.2517371,
 abstract = {Bit errors are common in wireless networks, and techniques for overcoming them traditionally consist of expensive retransmission (e.g. Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)) or expensive Forward Error Correction (FEC), both of which are undesirable in resource-constrained wireless networks such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we present TVA (Transmit-Verify-Acknowledge), a protocol that can correct errors without adding additional redundancy to data packets. Instead, TVA corrects errors using the redundancy inherent in Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRCs). The ubiquity of CRCs has the advantage of allowing TVA to be both backwards-compatible and backwards-efficient with link-layer protocols such as IEEE 802.15.4. We present a novel method of CRC error correction, which is compact and computationally efficient, and is designed to correct the most common error patterns observed in WSNs. We demonstrate that TVA provides reliability effectively equivalent to that of ARQ. We perform trace-driven simulations using data from sensor network deployments in different environments and analyze TVA's performance at different message lengths. To demonstrate the practicality of TVA, we implement it in TinyOS, and perform experiments on MicaZ motes to evaluate TVA in the presence of 802.11 interference. We find that TVA improves over ARQ and FEC-based protocols, using 31% less redundant communication and 30% less additional time to recover errored packets compared to ARQ.},

 abstract = {For understanding human activities in urban public spaces, we have been developing a sensing platform for visualizing data derived from sensor devices in the spaces. The platform collects sensing data from sensor devices installed in public spaces, and provide a simple communication interface to access the sensor data for client systems. In this demo abstract, we describe a working prototype of a sensor data streaming service for visualizing urban public spaces. The streaming data includes the number of pedestrians, pedestrian flows, and sound pressures of the human activities in the sensing area. As an application of the streaming service, we will show a client system that visualizes the current pedestrian flows in the sensing area with very little delay. The flows are visualized like a view of live camera without pedestrians' appearances. The system has a search interface to retrieve the sensing data in a past period and also visualizes them.},
