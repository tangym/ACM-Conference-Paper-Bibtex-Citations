 abstract = {While there is significant work on sensing and recognition of significant places for users, little attention has been given to users' significant routes. Recognizing these routine journeys, can open doors for the development of novel applications, like personalized travel alerts, and enhancement of user's travel experience. However, the high energy consumption of traditional location sensing technologies, such as GPS or WiFi based localization, is a barrier to passive and ubiquitous route sensing through smartphones. In this paper, we present a passive route sensing framework that continuously monitors a vehicle user solely through a phone's gyroscope and accelerometer. This approach can differentiate and recognize various routes taken by the user by time warping angular speeds experienced by the phone while in transit and is independent of phone orientation and location within the vehicle, small detours and traffic conditions. We compare the route learning and recognition capabilities of this approach with GPS trajectory analysis and show that it achieves similar performance. Moreover, with an embedded co-processor, common to most new generation phones, it achieves energy savings of an order of magnitude over the GPS sensor.},

 abstract = {For outdoor navigation, GPS provides the most widely-used means of node localization; however, the level of accuracy provided by low-cost receivers is typically insufficient for use in high-precision applications. Additionally, many of these applications do not require precise absolute Earth coordinates, but rather rely on relative positioning to infer information about the geometric configuration of the constituent nodes in a system. This paper presents a novel approach that uses GPS to derive relative location information for a scalable network of single-frequency receivers. Networked nodes share their raw satellite observations, enabling each node to localize its neighbors in a pairwise fashion as opposed to computing its own standalone position. Random and systematic errors are mitigated in novel ways, challenging long-standing beliefs that precision GPS systems require extensive stationary calibration times or complex equipment configurations. In addition to presenting the mathematical basis for our technique, a working prototype is developed, enabling experimental evaluation of several real-world test scenarios. The results of these experiments indicate sub-meter relative positioning accuracy under various conditions and in varying environments. This represents up to order of magnitude increase in precision over existing absolute positioning techniques or other unimodal GPS-based solutions.},

 abstract = {Automotive apps can improve efficiency, safety, comfort, and longevity of vehicular use. These apps achieve their goals by continuously monitoring sensors in a vehicle, and combining them with information from cloud databases in order to detect events that are used to trigger actions (e.g., alerting a driver, turning on fog lights, screening calls). However, modern vehicles have several hundred sensors that describe the low level dynamics of vehicular subsystems, these sensors can be combined in complex ways together with cloud information. Moreover, these sensor processing algorithms may incur significant costs in acquiring sensor and cloud information. In this paper, we propose a programming framework called CARLOG to simplify the task of programming these event detection algorithms. CARLOG uses Datalog to express sensor processing algorithms, but incorporates novel query optimization methods that can be used to minimize bandwidth usage, energy or latency, without sacrificing correctness of query execution. Experimental results on a prototype show that CARLOG can reduce latency by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to an unoptimized Datalog engine.},

Less invasive procedures can be achieved with the use of wireless Medical Capsule Robots (MCRs). MCRs are low powered and small in size and can be used for physiological parameter monitoring, therapy delivery, and biopsy sampling. Designing MCRs from the ground up is a costly and time consuming process. In this work, we present a flexible modular architecture to facilitate the design of MCRs and propose using TinyOS as the operating system. To assess the architecture and validate the feasibility of TinyOS, we implement a closed-loop control of a sensor-actuator system and compare the results with a traditional MCR built based on an 8051 microcontroller (MCU) programmed in plain C. Similar performances from the two approaches lead us to conclude that TinyOS is a valid option to implement a modular architecture for designing MCRs.},

The importance values of Android processes are in a hierarchy of foreground, visible, background etc. in decreasing order of importance. Whenever a new process arrives, it may necessitate removal of old and less important processes for reclaiming memory. Current smartphones do not provide any options through which user's idea of priority can override that of the system defaults. In this work we present an implementation that enables the user to obtain alerts on system load and recommendations to proactively kill a set of processes to reclaim system memory. This enables user selected background process to be spared from the standard android policy of process termination, in lieu of foreground apps, relatively unimportant from user perspective, during that period. We show that manual reclaiming of memory based on recommendations from our app, reduces the automatic killing and measurement lag experienced by a sensor analytics app under test.

We demonstrate, using a working prototype, that Ekho is capable of reproducing both solar and RF energy harvesting environments accurately and consistently. Our results show that Ekho can recreate harvesting-dependent program behaviors by emulating energy harvesting conditions accurately to within 77.4 μA for solar environments, and can emulate RF energy harvesting conditions significantly more consistently than a programmable RF harvesting environment.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2015). We hope you enjoy this conference that attracts a diverse set of attendees from both academia and industry and is a leading venue for publications and idea exchange on networked sensing. SenSys this year introduces a highly selective, single-track program featuring systems issues of sensors and sensor-enabled smart systems, broadly defined. It provides an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. The paper review process this year was highly selective. Out of 132 high quality submissions, only 27 were accepted for publication and presentation as full papers, yielding an acceptance rate around 20.45%. Submitted papers underwent a rigorous multistage review process. First, all submissions were checked for compliance and for general quality and topic match. Those not meeting conference criteria were administratively rejected without review. Papers surviving this stage were assigned three reviews in the first stage of the peer review process. At the conclusion of this stage, those papers that none of the reviewers recommended acceptance were rejected. The rest were assigned two additional reviews, thus totaling 5 reviews per paper. An online discussion phase then ensued, resulting in recommending 59 papers for discussion at the in-person physical PC meeting. At the conclusion of the PC meeting, a total of 27 papers were recommended for acceptance to the conference. All recommended papers were assigned shepherds to help ensure that the authors produce a final manuscript that satisfactorily addresses reviewer comments. All shepherded papers were ultimately accepted to the conference. Our program this year covers an exciting set of topics including energy, localization, systems, networking, information services and object/activity recognition. It also includes a poster/demo session, a panel, and two distinguished keynote speakers: Professor Raj Rajkumar from CMU, and Dr. Hendrik Hamann from IBM Research.},

On the cloud-side, we create an air-quality analytics engine that learn and create models of air-quality based on a fusion of sensor data. This engine is used to calibrate AQMs and mini-AQMs in real-time, and infer PM2:5 concentrations. We evaluate AirCloud using 5 months of data and 2 month of continuous deployment, and show that AirCloud is able to achieve good accuracies at much lower cost than previous solutions. We also show three real applications built on top of AirCloud by 3rd party developers to further demonstrate the value of our system.},

 abstract = {Network traffic prioritization is gaining attention in the WSN community, as more and more features are being integrated into sensor networks. Real-world deployment experience suggests that WSN brings new challenges to existing problems, such as resource constraints, low data-rate radios, and diverse application scenarios. We present the RushNet framework that prioritizes two common traffic patterns in multi-hop sensor networks: low-priority (LP) traffic that is large-volume but delay-tolerant, and high-priority (HP) traffic that is sporadic but latency-sensitive. RushNet achieves schedule-free and coordination-free delivery differentiations with the following features. First, RushNet works with most data collection protocols to deliver LP traffic. Second, RushNet leverages transmission power difference and radio capture effect to implement on-demand HP packet delivery with low overhead. Third, RushNet proposes a retrodiction technique to help nodes minimize the overhead of recovering LP packet loss due to concurrent HP traffic. We evaluate RushNet performance with micro-benchmarks and a crowdsourced office comfort monitoring deployment. The deployment results suggest RushNet can achieve a throughput close to network capacity, and deliver 98% of the HP packets with a latency of less than four seconds.},

This is especially important on smartphones, which are more prone to be lost or stolen than regular computers, and carry plenty of sensitive information. There is a multitude of signals that can be harnessed for continuous authentication on mobile devices, such as touch input, accelerometer, and gyroscope, etc. However, existing public datasets include only a handful of them, limiting the ability to do experiments that involve multiple modalities. To fill this gap, we performed a large-scale user study to collect a wide spectrum of signals on smartphones. Our dataset combines more modalities than existing datasets, including movement, orientation, touch, gestures, and pausality. This dataset has been used to evaluate our new behavioral modality named Hand Movement, Orientation, and Grasp (H-MOG).

However, in crowded indoor spaces, understanding the group-dependent movement behavior is a non-trivial problem as: (1) detecting groups is hard as the density ensures that at any location, a large number of people are moving together, (2) location tracking in many real-world venues is either absent or not very accurate, and (3) indoor mobility models that take into account group attributes (such as group size) are rare.

 abstract = {Sensor network research has facilitated advancements in various domains, such as industrial monitoring, environmental sensing, etc., and research challenges have shifted from creating infrastructure to utilizing it. Extracting meaningful information from sensor data, or control applications using the data, depends on the metadata available to interpret it, whether provided by novel networks or legacy instrumentation. Commercial buildings provide a valuable setting for investigating automated metadata acquisition and augmentation, as they typically comprise large sensor networks, but have limited, obscure metadata that are often meaningful only to the facility managers. Moreover, this primitive metadata is imprecise and varies across vendors and deployments. This state-of-the-art is a fundamental barrier to scaling analytics or intelligent control across the building stock, as even the basic steps involve labor intensive manual efforts by highly trained consultants. Writing building applications on its sensor network remains largely intractable as it involves extensive help from an expert in each building's design and operation to identify the sensors of interest and create the associated metadata. This process is repeated for each application development in a particular building, and across different buildings. This results in customized building-specific application queries which are not portable or scalable across buildings. We present a synthesis technique that learns how to transform a building's primitive sensor metadata to a common namespace by using a small number of examples from an expert, such as the building manager. Once the transformation rules are learned for one building, it can be applied across buildings with a similar primitive metadata structure. This common and understandable namespace captures the semantic relationship between sensors, enabling analytics applications that do not require apriori building-specific knowledge. Initial results show that learning the rules to transform 70% of the primitive metadata of two buildings (with completely different metadata structure), comprising 1600 and 2600 sensors, into a common namespace ([1]) took only 21 and 27 examples respectively(Figure 1c). The learned rules were able to transform similar primitive metadata in other buildings as well(Figure 1d), enabling writing of portable applications across these buildings. The techniques developed here may be applicable to the other large legacy sensor networks, such as industrial processing, or urban monitoring.},

We first consider the annual dynamics of the energy source to design an appropriate power subsystem (i.e., solar panel size and energy store capacity), and then dynamically compute the long-term sustainable performance level at runtime. We show through trace-driven simulations using eleven years of real-world data that our approach outperforms existing predictive, e.g., EWMA, WCMA, and reactive, e.g., ENO-MAX, approaches in terms of average performance level by up to 177%, while reducing duty-cycle variance by up to three orders of magnitude. We further demonstrate the benefits of the dynamic power management scheme using a wireless sensor system deployed for environmental monitoring in a remote, high-alpine environment as a case study. A performance evaluation over two years reveals that the dynamic power management scheme achieves a two-fold improvement in system utility when compared to only applying appropriate capacity planning.},

 abstract = {Accelerometer is the predominant sensor used for low-power context detection on smartphones. Although low-power, accelerometer is orientation and position-dependent, requires a high sampling rate, and subsequently complex processing and training to achieve good accuracy. We present an alternative approach for context detection using only the smartphone's barometer, a relatively new sensor now present in an increasing number of devices. The barometer is independent of phone position and orientation. Using a low sampling rate of 1 Hz, and simple processing based on intuitive logic, we demonstrate that it is possible to use the barometer for detecting the basic user activities of IDLE, WALKING, and VEHICLE at extremely low-power. We evaluate our approach using 47 hours of real-world transportation traces from 3 countries and 13 individuals, as well as more than 900 km of elevation data pulled from Google Maps from 5 cities, comparing power and accuracy to Google's accelerometer-based Activity Recognition algorithm, and to Future Urban Mobility Survey's (FMS) GPS-accelerometer server-based application. Our barometer-based approach uses 32 mW lower power compared to Google, and has comparable accuracy to both Google and FMS.

We design a feature called Radio Awake Length Counter and use it to classify and reveal network activity. Results from experiments on a real world testbed indicate that our approach can achieve up to 97% accuracy to identify the routing protocols, average 85% accuracy to distinguish application workloads.},

 abstract = {To save energy, wireless sensor networks often run in a low duty cycle mode, where the radios of sensor nodes are scheduled between ON and OFF states. For nodes to communicate with each other, Low Power Listening (LPL) and Low Power Probing (LPP) are two types of rendezvous mechanisms. Nodes with LPL or LPP rely on signal strength or probe packets to detect potential transmissions, and then keep the radio-on for communications. Unfortunately, in many cases, signal strength and probe packets are susceptible to interference, resulting in undesirable radio on time when the signal strength of interference is above a threshold or a probe packet is interfered. To address the issue, we propose ZiSense, an energy efficient rendezvous mechanism which is resilient to interference. Instead of checking the signal strength or decoding the probe packets, ZiSense detects the existence of ZigBee transmissions and wakes up nodes accordingly. On sensor nodes with limited information and resource, we carefully study and extract short-term features purely from the time-domain RSSI sequence, and design a rule-based approach to efficiently identify the existence of ZigBee. We theoretically analyze the benefit of ZiSense in different environments and implement a prototype in TinyOS with TelosB motes. We examine ZiSense performance under controlled interference and office environments. The evaluation results show that, compared with state-of-the-art rendezvous mechanisms, ZiSense significantly reduces the energy consumption.},

 abstract = {Real-time monitoring of groups and their rich contexts will be a key building block for futuristic, group-aware mobile services. In this paper, we propose GruMon, a fast and accurate group monitoring system for dense and complex urban spaces. GruMon meets the performance criteria of precise group detection at low latencies by overcoming two critical challenges of practical urban spaces, namely (a) the high density of crowds, and (b) the imprecise location information available indoors. Using a host of novel features extracted from commodity smartphone sensors, GruMon can detect over 80% of the groups, with 97% precision, using 10 minutes latency windows, even in venues with limited or no location information. Moreover, in venues where location information is available, GruMon improves the detection latency by up to 20% using semantic information and additional sensors to complement traditional spatio-temporal clustering approaches. We evaluated GruMon on data collected from 258 shopping episodes from 154 real participants, in two large shopping complexes in Korea and Singapore. We also tested GruMon on a large-scale dataset from an international airport (containing ≈37K+ unlabelled location traces per day) and a live deployment at our university, and showed both GruMon's potential performance at scale and various scalability challenges for real-world dense environment deployments.},

 abstract = {Whereas a few physical layer techniques have been proposed to locate a signal source indoors, they all deem multipath a "curse" and hence take great efforts to cope with it. Consequently, each sensor only obtains the information about the direct path; this necessitates a networked sensing system (hence higher system complexity and deployment cost) with at least three sensors to actually locate a source. In this paper, we deem multipath a "bless" and thus innovatively exploit the power of it. Essentially, with minor knowledge of the geometry of an indoor space, each signal path may potentially contribute a new piece of information to the location of its source. As a result, it is possible to locate the source with only one hand-held device. At the same time, the extra information provided by multipath can help to at least partially reconstruct the geometry of the indoor space, which enables a floor plan generation process missing in most of the indoor localization systems. To demonstrate these ideas, we implement a USRP-based radio sensor prototype named iLocScan; it can simultaneously scan an indoor space (hence generate a plan for it) and position the signal source in it. Through iLocScan, we mainly aim to showcase the feasibility of harnessing multipath in assisting indoor localization, rather than to rival existing proposals in terms of localization accuracy. Nevertheless, our experiments show that iLocScan offers satisfactory results on both source localization and space scanning.},

Unfortunately, it is still non-trivial to coordinate multiple drones to perform a task collaboratively. We present a novel programming model called team-level programming that can express collaborative sensing tasks without exposing the complexity of managing multiple drones, such as concurrent programming, parallel execution, scaling, and failure recovering. We create the Voltron programming system to explore the concept of team-level programming in active sensing applications. Voltron offers programming constructs to create the illusion of a simple sequential execution model while still maximizing opportunities to dynamically re-task the drones as needed. We implement Voltron by targeting a popular aerial drone platform, and evaluate the resulting system using a combination of real deployments, user studies, and emulation. Our results indicate that Voltron enables simpler code and produces marginal overhead in terms of CPU, memory, and network utilization. In addition, it greatly facilitates implementing correct and complete collaborative drone applications, compared to existing drone programming systems.},

These reflections effectively light up the objects, which we use to perform imaging. Our algorithms separate the multi-path reflections from different objects into an image. They can also extract depth information where objects in the same direction, but at different distances to the receiver, can be identified. We implement a prototype wireless receiver using USRP-N210s at 2.4 GHz and demonstrate that it can image objects such as leather couches and metallic shapes in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept applications including localization of static humans and objects, without the need for tagging them with RF devices. Our results show that we can localize static human subjects and metallic objects with a median accuracy of 26 and 15 cm respectively. Finally, we discuss the limits of our Wi-Fi based approach to imaging.},

 abstract = {The environmental context of a mobile device determines how it is used and how the device can optimize operations for greater efficiency and usability. We consider the problem of detecting if a device is indoor or outdoor. Towards this end, we present a general method employing semi-supervised machine learning and using only the lightweight sensors on a smartphone. We find that a particular semi-supervised learning method called co-training, when suitably engineered, is most effective. It is able to automatically learn characteristics of new environments and devices, and thereby provides a detection accuracy exceeding 90% even in unfamiliar circumstances. It can learn and adapt online, in real time, at modest computational costs. Thus the method is suitable for on-device learning. Implementation of the indoor-outdoor detection service based on our method is lightweight in energy use -- it can sleep when not in use and does not need to track the device state continuously. It is shown to outperform existing indoor-outdoor detection techniques that rely on static algorithms or GPS, in terms of both accuracy and energy-efficiency.},

 abstract = {The rapidly growing adoption of sensor-enabled smartphones has greatly fueled the proliferation of applications that use phone sensors to monitor user behavior. A central sensor among these is the microphone which enables, for instance, the detection of valence in speech, or the identification of speakers. Deploying multiple of these applications on a mobile device to continuously monitor the audio environment allows for the acquisition of a diverse range of sound-related contextual inferences. However, the cumulative processing burden critically impacts the phone battery. To address this problem, we propose DSP.Ear -- an integrated sensing system that takes advantage of the latest low-power DSP co-processor technology in commodity mobile devices to enable the continuous and simultaneous operation of multiple established algorithms that perform complex audio inferences. The system extracts emotions from voice, estimates the number of people in a room, identifies the speakers, and detects commonly found ambient sounds, while critically incurring little overhead to the device battery. This is achieved through a series of pipeline optimizations that allow the computation to remain largely on the DSP. Through detailed evaluation of our prototype implementation we show that, by exploiting a smartphone's co-processor, DSP.Ear achieves a 3 to 7 times increase in the battery lifetime compared to a solution that uses only the phone's main processor. In addition, DSP.Ear is 2 to 3 times more power efficient than a naïve DSP solution without optimizations. We further analyze a large-scale dataset from 1320 Android users to show that in about 80-90% of the daily usage instances DSP.Ear is able to sustain a full day of operation (even in the presence of other smartphone workloads) with a single battery charge.},

However, studying interaction distance, which is known to impact disease spread, communication behavior, and other phenomenon, has proven challenging. Smartphones are limited by their inaccurate and/or impractical ranging capabilities, while wearable sensors are limited by their need for infrastructure nodes, bulkiness, and/or inaccurate ranging. To address these challenges, we present Opo, a 14 cm2, 11.4 g "lapel pin" built from commercial components. Opo sensors range neighbors every 2 s up to 2 m away with 5% average error, all while requiring zero infrastructure and improving upon current wearable sensors' accuracy and power usage. The cornerstone of Opo is an ultrasonic wakeup circuit that draws 19 μA when no neighbors are present. This enables Opo sensors to discover and range neighbors without the need for infrastructure nodes and slow or power-hungry RF discovery protocols. Thus, Opo is able to sense interaction distance with high accuracy (5 cm) and temporal fidelity (2 s) on a limited power budget.},

Currently, researchers rely on mainly two options: external measurement tools, which are precise but constrain the mobility of the device and require the annotation of power traces; or modelling methods, which allow mobility and consider explicitly the state of events, but have less accuracy and lower sampling rates than external tools. We address the challenges of mobile power analysis with a novel power metering toolkit, called NEAT, which comprises a coin-sized power measurement board that fits inside a typical smartphone, and analysis software that automatically fuses the event logs taken from the phone with the obtained power trace. The combination of high-fidelity power measurements and detailed information about the state of the phone's hardware and software components allows for fine-grained analysis of complex and short-lived energy patterns. We equipped smartphones with NEAT and conducted various experiments to highlight (i) its accuracy with respect to model-based approaches, showing errors upwards of 20%; (ii) its ability to gather accurate and well annotated user-data "in the wild", which would be hard to do with current external meters; and (iii) the importance of having fine-granular and expressive traces by resolving kernel energy bugs.},
