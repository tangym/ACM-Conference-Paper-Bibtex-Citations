At its core, our approach involves a shift in who analyzes data: from adult data scientists to young learners themselves. We first introduce the goals and design of the system and then demonstrate it by describing example projects that illustrate its functionality. Next, we show through a series of case studies how the system engages children in not only representing data and answering questions with data but also in self-reflection about their own learning and participation.},

We find that the ethos of "fair chase" serves to unite an eclectic group of hunters under a single moral compass. Fair chase posits, for example, that hunters must not have an improper advantage over animals. The actual practices of hunters in different communities (e.g., communities revolving around different weapons or professions), however, reveals a series of opposing points of view among hunters at large on what actually constitutes fair chase. We suggest that an understanding of fair chase and its dialectics can constructively problematize nature for human-computer interaction.},

However, research has not been conducted to evaluate whether this holds true when involving geometry input to facilitate quantitative problem-solving. We developed a bimodal (graphing geometric shapes and writing algebraic expressions) user interface, in order to conduct a within-subject, controlled experiment with 24 college students and varied two types of geometry input: 1) sketch-based input and 2) structured input. The sketch-based input was significantly faster than the structured input, but there were no significant differences based on perception and cognition. However, after a post-hoc analysis, we found a significant interaction effect on perception between prior knowledge and geometry input. Novice students preferred the sketch-based input, but advanced students preferred the structured input. Our study implies that natural sketch-based input may be less preferable than structured input for geometry-based interfaces toward math problem-solving.},

Building upon those studies, this paper provides unique insight from a 3-year longitudinal study on the use of online tools that were organically adapted by citizens to engage in local governance in three diverse Chicago neighborhoods. Though the responsiveness of government officials varied across communities, our results suggest that citizens use technology to heighten the visibility of their concerns, to support mechanisms of government accountability, and to provide various options for resident participation in local governance. We argue that while communities may be effective in their use of ICTs, technology may not increase their political power.},

To investigate this question, we designed and prototyped a new class of privacy indicators, called Data Controller Indicators (DCIs), that expose previously hidden information flows out of the apps. Our lab study of DCIs suggests that such indicators do support people in making more confident and consistent choices, informed by a more diverse range of factors, including the number and nature of third-party companies that access users' data. Furthermore, personalised DCIs, which are contextualised against the other apps an individual already uses, enable them to reason effectively about the differential impacts on their overall information exposure.},

Recent advances in wireless sensing show promise for a ubiquitous gesture-based interaction interface with Wi-Fi. In this work, we extract complete information of motion-induced Doppler shifts with only commodity Wi-Fi. The key insight is to harness antenna diversity to carefully eliminate random phase shifts while retaining relevant Doppler shifts. We further correlate Doppler shifts with motion directions, and propose a light-weight pipeline to detect, segment, and recognize motions without training. On this basis, we present WiDance, a Wi-Fi-based user interface, which we utilize to design and prototype a contactless dance-pad exergame.

Rather than tracking individual users for the duration of an activity, Group Touch distinguishes users from each other by modeling whether an interaction with the tabletop corresponds to either: (1) a new user, or (2) a change in users currently interacting with the tabletop. This reframing of the challenge as distinguishing users rather than tracking and identifying them allows Group Touch to support multi-user collaboration in real-world settings without custom instrumentation. Specifically, Group Touch examines pairs of touches and uses the difference in orientation, distance, and time between two touches to determine whether the same person performed both touches in the pair. Validated with field data from high-school students in a classroom setting, Group Touch distinguishes among users "in the wild" with a mean accuracy of 92.92% (SD=3.94%). Group Touch can imbue collaborative touch applications in real-world settings with the ability to distinguish among multiple users.},

However, in doing so, they expose themselves to potential risks, ranging from being targets of robbery to the more subtle social losses through being seen to be rude or inattentive to those around them. In nature, some animals can blend into their environments to avoid being eaten or to reduce their impact on the ecosystem around them. Taking inspiration from these evolved systems we investigate the notion of chameleon approaches for mobile interaction design. Our probes were motivated, inspired and refined through extended interactions with people drawn from contexts with differing ranges of security and privacy concerns. Through deployments on users' own devices, our prototypes show the value of the concept. The encouraging results motivate further research in materials and form factors that can provide more effective automatic plain-sight hiding.},

 abstract = {Designing for reflection is becoming an increasingly important part of many HCI systems in a wide range of application domains. However, there is a gap in our understanding of how the process of reflection can be supported through technology. In fact, an implicit assumption in the majority of existing work is that, just by providing access to well-selected data, in-depth reflection can and will occur. To counter this view, we draw on Schön's notion of reflective practicum and apply it as a sensitising concept to identify the complex interplay of factors that support transformative reflection in the context of two social-emotional learning (SEL) studies. The results highlight the need to carefully scaffold the process of reflection, rather than simply assume that the capability to reflect is a broadly available trait to be 'triggered' through data. Building on this analysis, we develop a conceptual framework that extends the concept of the reflective practicum towards identifying appropriate roles of technology to support transformative reflection. While our case is within the context of SEL, we argue that a deeper understanding of these opportunities can also benefit designing for reflection in other areas.},

Users wore our variable-friction prototype shoe on their right foot, which they slid on a low-friction surface to control a mouse cursor. Two interface modes were evaluated: constant (CF) and variable friction (VF), under the ISO 9241-9 standard for pointing device evaluation. For the variable-friction modality, target regions were high friction to provide sliding resistance cues. Our findings confirmed that variable-friction foot-controlled pointing can achieve throughput competitive with a range of hand-controlled devices. This suggests the potential for taking advantage of foot input for simple pointing tasks, in particular when the hands are overloaded. With respect to other foot-controlled pointing systems, our implementation offered improved performance and comparable error rates. In addition, the analysis provided further insight into the design of foot-controlled input devices.},

The suit can "freeze" users' body parts, for example during a game in order to provide the physical sensation of being frozen by an enemy. In this paper we first present the Frozen Suit concept and its potential applications. We then systematically investigate how to design jamming patches in order to sufficiently restrict an arm or a leg. In particular we used low-fidelity prototypes to explore the restricting power of different material and particles. In order to push this analysis further we conducted a controlled experiment in order to compare the perceived stiffness of different patches sizes attached to the elbow. We performed a paired comparison experience and used a Bradley-Terry-Luce model to analyze the subjective feedback from participants. We found that 20cm long x 7cm large is the most restrictive patch and that an increase in patch area correlates with an increase in perceived stiffness (quadratic). We finish by presenting a use case application with a game that we implemented where enemies can freeze the player.},

TDome allows versatile interactions that address major MDE tasks, which we illustrate through various proof-of-concept implementations: detect surrounding displays, select one display, transfer data across displays, reach distant displays and perform private interactions. We explore TDome's usability and suitability for MDEs through three user studies. First we explore combined physical+touch gestures from which we discard uncomfortable combinations. We experimentally validate their feasibility and come up with a set of 71 combined gestures that are comfortable and ensure a high success rate, i.e. that can be easily performed and efficiently detected. Finally, we collect user feedback to identify natural mappings between gestures and MDE interactions.},

Feedback increased self-awareness and the use of socially-focused words, and decreased the use of words expressing certainty. In addition, mixed-gender dyads rated themselves as more socially orientated with feedback than without, which was reflected in an increased use of inclusive pronouns and affiliation words, and fewer words expressing discrepancy. However, with feedback, same-gender dyads reported greater task orientation than mixed-gender dyads reflected in increased use of task-relevant words.

However, tolerance to turbulence is a challenge for their deployment. To better understand the impact of turbulence on cockpit input methods we conducted a comparative study of user performance with three input methods -- touch, trackball (as currently used in commercial aircraft), and a touchscreen stencil overlay designed to assist finger stabilization. These input methods were compared across a variety of interactive tasks and at three levels of simulated turbulence (none, low, and high). Results showed that performance degrades and subjective workload increases as vibration increases. Touch-based interaction was faster than the trackball when precision requirements were low (at all vibrations), but it was slower and less accurate for more precise pointing, particularly at high vibrations. The stencil did not improve touch selection times, although it did reduce errors on small targets at high vibrations, but only when finger lift-off errors had been eliminated by a timeout. Our work provides new information on the types of tasks affected by turbulence and the input mechanisms that perform best under different levels of vibration.},

 abstract = {Developing information technology to democratize scientific knowledge and support citizen empowerment is a challenging task. In our case, a local community suffered from air pollution caused by industrial activity. The residents lacked the technological fluency to gather and curate diverse scientific data to advocate for regulatory change. We collaborated with the community in developing an air quality monitoring system which integrated heterogeneous data over a large spatial and temporal scale. The system afforded strong scientific evidence by using animated smoke images, air quality data, crowdsourced smell reports, and wind data. In our evaluation, we report patterns of sharing smoke images among stakeholders. Our survey study shows that the scientific knowledge provided by the system encourages agonistic discussions with regulators, empowers the community to support policy making, and rebalances the power relationship between stakeholders.},

This paper presents a novel method for generating such datasets, along with several examples. Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the benefit of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.},

 abstract = {EarFieldSensing (EarFS) is a novel input method for mobile and wearable computing using facial expressions. Facial muscle movements induce both electric field changes and physical deformations, which are detectable with electrodes placed inside the ear canal. The chosen ear-plug form factor is rather unobtrusive and allows for facial gesture recognition while utilizing the close proximity to the face. We collected 25 facial-related gestures and used them to compare the performance levels of several electric sensing technologies (EMG, CS, EFS, EarFS) with varying electrode setups. Our developed wearable fine-tuned electric field sensing employs differential amplification to effectively cancel out environmental noise while still being sensitive towards small facial-movement-related electric field changes and artifacts from ear canal deformations. By comparing a mobile with a stationary scenario, we found that EarFS continues to perform better in a mobile scenario. Quantitative results show EarFS to be capable of detecting a set of 5 facial gestures with a precision of 90% while sitting and 85.2% while walking. We provide detailed instructions to enable replication of our low-cost sensing device. Applying it to different positions of our body will also allow to sense a variety of other gestures and activities.},

If the fingerprints do not match, that may signal a man-in-the-middle attack. An adversary performing an attack may use a fingerprint that is similar to the target fingerprint, but not an exact match, to try to fool inattentive users. Fingerprint representations should thus be both usable and secure. We tested the usability and security of eight fingerprint representations under different configurations. In a 661-participant between-subjects experiment, participants compared fingerprints under realistic conditions and were subjected to a simulated attack. The best configuration allowed attacks to succeed 6% of the time; the worst 72%. We find the seemingly effective compare-and-select approach performs poorly for key fingerprints and that graphical fingerprint representations, while intuitive and fast, vary in performance. We identify some fingerprint representations as particularly promising.},

We report on a study comparing a novel intervention of seeking support from one's social network to the more common approaches of expressive writing and studying task-relevant materials for simulated open-ended test questions. We measured in-the-moment (state) anxiety before and after each intervention, and correctness of the solutions. We also surveyed students to learn about their perceptions of the interventions. Our results showed that social support decreased the anxiety of high test-anxious students by 21% with the reduction in anxiety correlating with the number of messages received. Social support also allowed high test-anxious students to score at the level of low test-anxious students. Expressive writing showed a similar effect, but increased the anxiety of low test-anxious students by 61%. Studying task materials had no effect on anxiety and high test-anxious students performed worse than low test-anxious students. Despite benefiting from social support, we found that students were uncomfortable soliciting support from their online social network. Realizing the benefits of this approach may therefore require different formulations of social support in practice.},

We then address the major concerns by building a mobile app that supports easy event capture/access, context tagging, and privacy preservation. Our two-week user study (n = 23) showed Roadwatch effectively supported community policing activities on the road. Further, we found that the critical factors for reporting are personal involvement and seriousness of risks, and participants were mainly motivated by their contribution to traffic safety. Finally, we discuss several practical design implications to facilitate community policing on the road.},

In this paper, we present an in-depth qualitative study observing the behaviour and discussing the strategy used by non-expert participants to create, interact, update and communicate a concept map that represents a collection of research ideas. Our results show non-expert individuals create concept maps differently to visualisation algorithms.

In a controlled experiment, subjects rated visualization sequences covering a taxonomy of common transition types. In all but one case, GraphScape's highest-ranked suggestion aligns with subjects' top-rated sequences.

They are being explored in a wide range of application scenarios from medical surgery to car dashboard controllers. One aspect of touchless interaction that has not been explored to date is the Sense of Agency (SoA). The SoA refers to the subjective experience of voluntary control over actions in the external world. In this paper, we investigated the SoA in touchless systems using the intentional binding paradigm. We first compare touchless systems with physical interactions and then augmented different types of haptic feedback to explore how different outcome modalities influence intentional binding. From our experiments, we demonstrated that an intentional binding effect is observed in both physical and touchless interactions with no statistical difference. Additionally, we found that haptic and auditory feedback help to increase SoA compared with visual feedback in touchless interfaces. We discuss these findings and identify design opportunities that take agency into consideration.},

Our system introduces two technical contributions: 1) encoding the crowd's division of labor into de-individualized roles, much as movie crews or disaster response teams use roles to support coordination between on-demand workers who have not worked together before; and 2) reconfiguring these structures through a model inspired by version control, enabling continuous adaptation of the work and the division of labor. We report a deployment in which flash organizations successfully carried out open-ended and complex goals previously out of reach for crowdsourcing, including product design, software development, and game production.

Using PathViewer, we analyzed how several students solved a Python assignment, discovering interesting and unexpected patterns.

That is, our system generates mirroring by producing a pseudo-smile through image processing. We conducted an experiment in which pairs of participants had brief conversations via FaceShare.

 abstract = {Prevention of errors has been an orienting goal within the field of Human-Computer Interaction since its inception, with particular focus on minimizing human errors through appropriate technology design. However, there has been relatively little exploration into how designers can best support users of technologies that will inevitably make errors. We present a mixed-methods study in the domain of navigation technology for visually impaired individuals. We examined how users respond to device errors made in realistic scenarios of use. Contrary to conventional wisdom that usable systems must be error-free, we found that 42% of errors were acceptable to users. Acceptance of errors depends on error type, building feature, and environmental context. Further, even when a technical error is acceptable to the user, the misguided social responses of others nearby can negatively impact user experience. We conclude with design recommendations that embrace errors while also supporting user management of errors in technical systems.},

 abstract = {HCI researchers investigating the politics of technology design have recently focused on how design practice can tackle "Matters of Concern" - complex social issues perceived and experienced in multiple ways. These researchers suggest design research can generate new networks of human and non-human actors to express and act on these issues. Prior studies, however, tend to restrict their networks within traditional boundaries (e.g. existing organizations, local communities) and categories (e.g. human/nonhuman binary) without examining their significance for participants. We suggest collaborative map making as a reflexive method for understanding current Matters of Concern from the perspectives of diverse actors, not just researchers. As case studies of the method's use, we present two studies of domestic computing technologies in the US and South Korea, which show how collaborative map making allows salient networks to expand beyond the individual actors in the home to local and global power issues outside of boundaries (e.g. physical house) and categories (e.g. private/public space) commonly recognized in HCI. Our methodology provides HCI researchers with a way to understand existing Matters of Concern, so they can position themselves to address and act on these issues.},

In this paper, we draw upon perspectives from Feminist HCI to extend the current knowledge of issues in gaming that are specific to women. We present results from a mixed-methods study with 327 participants who are students and alumnae of a women's college. Our findings shed light on the complex relationships of women with games, with other gamers, and with gaming culture and industry. The results also indicate that in some cases gender-related negative experiences of gaming have lasting impact on the participation and self-confidence of young women.

Six techniques are evaluated, spanning current and future techniques: long press, non-dominant hand, two-fingers, hard press, knuckle, and thumb-on-finger. Two poses are controlled for, seated with the tablet on a desk and standing with the tablet held on the forearm. Findings indicate pose has no effect on mode switching time and little effect on error rate; using two-fingers is fastest while long press is much slower; non-preferred hand and thumb-on-finger also rate highly in subjective scores. The experiment protocol is based on Li et al.'s pen mode-switching study, enabling a comparison of touch and pen mode switching. Among the common techniques, the non-dominant hand is faster than pressure with touch, whereas no significant difference had been found for pen. Our work addresses the lack of empirical evidence comparing touch mode-switching techniques and provides guidance to practitioners when choosing techniques and to researchers when designing new mode-switching methods.},

Traditional technology (e.g., hearing aids) often fails to offer enough value, has low adoption rates, and can result in social stigma. Speechreading can dramatically improve conversational understanding, but speechreading is a skill that can be challenging to learn. To address this, we developed a novel speechreading acquisition framework that can be used to design Speechreading Acquisition Tools (SATs) - a new type of technology to improve speechreading acquisition. We interviewed seven speechreading tutors and used thematic analysis to identify and organise the key elements of our framework. We then evaluated our framework by using it to: 1) categorise every tutor-identified speechreading teaching technique, 2) critically evaluate existing conversational aids, and 3) design three new SATs. Through the use of SATs designed using our framework, the speechreading abilities of people with hearing loss around the world should be enhanced, thereby improving the conversational foundation of their day-to-day lives.},

The model is based on the assumption that interaction for decision making is an example of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) in which observations are made by limited perceptual systems that model human foveated vision and decisions are made by strategies that are adapted to the task. We illustrate the model by applying it to the task of determining whether to block a credit card given a number of variables including the location of a transaction, its amount, and the customer history. Each of these variables have a different validity and users may weight them accordingly. The model solves the POMDP by learning patterns of eye movements (strategies) adapted to different presentations of the data. We compare the model behavior to human performance on the credit card transaction task.},

These interfaces provide limited capabilities for previewing content in a VR headset or for directly manipulating the spherical video in an intuitive way. As a result, editors must alternate between editing on the desktop and previewing in the headset, which is tedious and interrupts the creative process. We demonstrate an application that enables a user to directly edit spherical video while fully immersed in a VR headset. We first interviewed professional VR filmmakers to understand current practice and derived a suitable workflow for in-headset VR video editing. We then developed a prototype system implementing this new workflow. Our system is built upon a familiar timeline design, but is enhanced with custom widgets to enable intuitive editing of spherical video inside the headset. We conducted an expert review study and found that with our prototype, experts were able to edit videos entirely within the headset. Experts also found our interface and widgets useful, providing intuitive controls for their editing needs.},

This tension can be particularly problematic when personas (who, of course as "people" have genders) are used to promote gender inclusiveness - because reinforcing stereotypical perceptions can run counter to gender inclusiveness. In this paper we explicitly investigate this tension through a new approach to personas: one that includes multiple photos (of males and females) for a single persona. We compared this approach to an identical persona with only one photo using a controlled laboratory study and an eye-tracking study. Our goal was to answer the following question: is it possible for personas to encourage product designers to engage with personas while at the same avoiding promoting gender stereotyping? Our results are encouraging about the use of personas with multiple pictures as a way to expand participants' consideration of multiple genders without reducing their engagement with the persona.},

Our three-week between-subjects field experiment revealed that worker busyness caused 30.1% relative decrease of task completion rate. Mean accepted task price increased by 7.6% when workers are with companions. Worker fatigue caused 37.4% relative decrease of task quality.},

We developed a theoretically motivated model to predict the likelihood of emergency physicians returning to an interrupted task. Eighteen emergency physicians were observed individually for two-hour blocks of time, resulting in a total of 2160 minutes of observation and 231 interruptions. We used a mixed effects logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of primary task resumption after interruptions. The likelihood of primary task resumption was predicted by memory decay, measured by the duration of the interruption, workload, measured by the patient volume during the shift, and whether shift was day or night. With a better understanding of these interruptions, we can help design interventions to manage interruptions, minimize medical errors, and improve patient safety.},

We evaluate pen and touch, Wii Remote, Kinect, Leap Motion, and sound-sensed gesture datasets as well as conduct tests with continuous data.

Second, we conduct an online survey to examine how different interactions with the UI affect users' expectations about whether an app accesses sensitive resources. Our results suggest that user interactions such as button clicks can be interpreted as authorization, reducing the need for separate requests; but that accesses not directly tied to user interactions should be separately authorized, possibly when apps are first launched.},

We explore personal object recognizers, where visually impaired people train a mobile application with a few snapshots of objects of interest and provide custom labels. We adopt transfer learning with a deep learning system for user-defined multi-label k-instance classification. Experiments with blind participants demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, which reaches accuracies over 90% for some participants. We analyze user data and feedback to explore effects of sample size, photo-quality variance, and object shape; and contrast models trained on photos by blind participants to those by sighted participants and generic recognizers.},

Motivated by arguments that 'second screening' practices offer opportunities to engage viewers with issues of political concern, we describe the design and evaluation of two smartphone apps that facilitate and promote more critical live-viewing of reality TV. Our apps, Spotting Guide and Moral Compass, encourage users to identify, categorise, tag and filter patterns and tropes within reality TV, as well as reinterpret social media posts associated with their broadcast. We show that such interactions encourage critical thinking around typical editing and production techniques and foster co-discussion and reflection amongst viewers. We discuss, more broadly, how these interactions encourage users to identify the wider consequences and framings of reality TV, and offer implications and considerations for design that provokes criticality and reflection in second screening contexts.},

In controlled experiments with workers on Mechanical Turk, we compare the effects of these secondary tasks to simple idea exposure or no support at all, examining usage of the inspirations, fluency, breadth, and depth of ideas generated. We find tasks to be as good or better than exposure, although this depends on the period of ideation and the fluency level.

This strategy allows third-party developers and researchers to modify an interaction without an application's source code, without rooting the phone, without otherwise modifying an application, while retaining all capabilities of the system (e.g., Android's full implementation of the TalkBack screen reader). This paper introduces interaction proxies, defines a design space of interaction re-mappings, identifies necessary implementation abstractions, presents details of implementing those abstractions in Android, and demonstrates a set of Android implementations of interaction proxies from throughout our design space. We then present a set of interviews with blind and low-vision people interacting with our prototype interaction proxies, using these interviews to explore the seamlessness of interaction, the perceived usefulness and potential of interaction proxies, and visions of how such enhancements could gain broad usage. By allowing third-party developers and researchers to improve an interaction, interaction proxies offer a new approach to personalizing mobile application accessibility and a new approach to catalyzing development, deployment, and evaluation of mobile accessibility enhancements.},

We first present examples of this pervasive phenomenon in naturally occurring Skype conversations, revealing how this conduct is configured and organized within the interaction between participants. We reveal how the subtle adjustment of the position of the body, the head and gaze with respect to the handheld objects offers crucial resources for participants to achieve joint seeing. Then we report on a quite different setting, a naturalistic experiment where participants collaborate on a collective task with remote colleagues through maneuverable, orientable devices (Kubis). Again, in these experiments participants frequently show objects, and at times the devices provide additional resources to support these activities. But at other times they also involve some difficulties. We conclude by suggesting possible technological developments, some quite simple, others more radical, that might support participants to show objects, whether they are in domestic settings or undertaking work activities.},

There are many validated approaches for measuring player experience that are grounded in psychological theories on motivation and emotion. Attribution theory explains how people assign causes to events and how these attributions affect peoples' emotional reactions and motivations. In this paper we argue that attribution theory can provide additional value to the existing suite of GUR tools; however, there are currently no validated tools to assess player attribution in the context of games. This paper describes the conceptualization of player attribution based on literature, presents the development and validation of a scale to assess player attribution in games, and discusses the implications of adding player attribution to the toolbox of methods for the design and evaluation of digital games.},

 abstract = {One of the main barriers to immersivity during object manipulation in virtual reality is the lack of realistic haptic feedback. Our goal is to convey compelling interactions with virtual objects, such as grasping, squeezing, pressing, lifting, and stroking, without requiring a bulky, world-grounded kinesthetic feedback device (traditional haptics) or the use of predetermined passive objects (haptic retargeting). To achieve this, we use a pair of finger-mounted haptic feedback devices that deform the skin on the fingertips to convey cutaneous force information from object manipulation. We show that users can perceive differences in virtual object weight and that they apply increasing grasp forces when lifting virtual objects as rendered mass is increased. Moreover, we show how naive users perceive changes of a virtual object's physical properties when we use skin deformation to render objects with varying mass, friction, and stiffness. These studies demonstrate that fingertip skin deformation devices can provide a compelling haptic experience appropriate for virtual reality scenarios involving object manipulation.},

These effects are frequently due to external factors properties and phenomena that are unrelated to the deployment. Therefore, we conducted a literature review within the public display domain to investigate the causes behind the reported issues. This work presents a taxonomy of external factors affecting deployments, consisting of six categories: weather, events, surroundings, space, inhabitants, and vandalism. Apart from a few positive examples, we predominantly found negative effects arising from these factors. We then identified four ways of addressing the effects: ignoring, adapting, solving, and embracing. Of these, ignoring and adapting are substantially more frequent responses than solving and embracing emphasizing the need for researchers to adapt. We present real-world examples and insights on how researchers and practitioners can address the effects to better manage their deployments.},

How can we facilitate rapid prototyping of rapid prototyping tools? We propose a novel set of modules, the Cardboard Machine Kit, for the construction of digital fabrication machines. These open-source modules are implemented using cardboard frames, stepper motors, and networked electronics controlled through a Python library. We evaluated the kit both through machine building workshops and by studying the usage of the kit in the wild. In the wild we observed more than 500 novice machine builders who built 125 different machines for 15 different application types. We argue that this breadth demonstrates the efficacy of this modular approach. Finally we discuss the limitations of the Cardboard Machine Kit and discuss how it could inform future machine building infrastructure.},

Our results show that real-time movement sonification led to an increased sense of control during challenging everyday tasks. Sonification calibrated to functional activity facilitated application of pain management techniques such as pacing. When calibrated to individual needs, sonification enabled serendipitous discovery of physical capabilities otherwise obscured by a focus on pain or a dysfunctional proprioceptive system.

In this paper, we conducted a workshop to design a clinician interface supporting the integration of data-driven consultation into the existing workflow and investigate the role of the interface in situ. After implementing the clinician interface designed based on the workshop results, we observed 32 cases of actual use within the clinical context. We found that our interface, DataMD, helped the clinician construct a new workflow, enhanced the clinician's counseling skills, and facilitated more in-depth conversation.

This impedes a pair's ability to efficiently communicate about on-screen locations and makes synchronous coordination difficult. We designed a novel gaze visualization for remote pair programmers which shows where in the code their partner is currently looking, and changes color when they are looking at the same thing. Our design is unobtrusive, and transparently depicts the imprecision inherent in eye tracking technology. We evaluated our design with an experiment in which pair programmers worked remotely on code refactoring tasks. Our results show that with the visualization, pairs spent a greater proportion of their time concurrently looking at the same code locations. Pairs communicated using a larger ratio of implicit to explicit references, and were faster and more successful at responding to those references.},

MistForm also enables unique interaction possibilities by exploiting the synergies between shape changing interfaces and mid-air fog displays. For instance, moving the screen will affect the brightness and blurriness of the screen at specific locations around the display, creating spaces with similar (collaboration) or different visibility (personalized content). We describe the design of MistForm and analyse its inherent challenges, such as image distortion and uneven brightness on dynamic curved surfaces. We provide a machine learning approach to characterize the shape of the screen and a rendering algorithm to remove aberrations.

Consequently, design strategies for balancing game difficulty are discussed by both academics and game designers. In this paper, we study how manipulating the following design decisions, commonly found in platformers, moderates difficulty: Scroll Speed, Target Size, Jump Task Complexity, and Perspective. Results for Scroll Speed and Target Size indicate that errors increase as speed increases and platform size decreases. However, results for jump task complexity demonstrate a separation of errors from task complexity. Specifically, while double-jump tasks are harder than single-jump tasks, triple-jump tasks appear to be as difficult as double-jump tasks. Additionally, the study demonstrates how changes in perspective affect the errors made by players in gameplay. The study results are applicable both to automatic level generation and dynamic difficulty adjustment in platformer games.},

However, standard touch interactions, such as dragging to move content, do not scale well to large surfaces and were not designed to support collaboration, such as passing an object around. This paper introduces CoReach, a set of collaborative gestures that combine input from multiple users in order to manipulate content, facilitate data exchange and support communication. We conducted an observational study to inform the design of CoReach, and a controlled study showing that it reduced physical fatigue and facilitated collaboration when compared with traditional multi-touch gestures. A final study assessed the value of also allowing input through a handheld tablet to manipulate content from a distance.},

To ensure that the project is completed successfully, these disparate groups of people engage in articulation work, which is the meta-work that supports the use of collaborative systems. In this paper, we examine the articulation work surrounding the deployment of systems that have found limited long-term adoption: assistive technology. Specifically, we examine three research deployments of a collaborative game for children with autism. Analysis of the articulation work performed during these studies demonstrates how research deployments of technologies create conditions in which stakeholders must take on additional roles to make the deployment work. By understanding the articulation work surrounding deployment studies engendered in this role fluidity, we can improve both research design and the analysis of data emergent from these studies.},

Although there has been widespread adoption of photo-sharing platforms such as Instagram in recent years, the role of visual imagery as a mechanism of self-disclosure is less understood. We study the nature of visual attributes manifested in images relating to mental health disclosures on Instagram. Employing computer vision techniques on a corpus of thousands of posts, we extract and examine three visual attributes: visual features (e.g., color), themes, and emotions in images. Our findings indicate the use of imagery for unique self-disclosure needs, quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from those shared via the textual modality: expressions of emotional distress, calls for help, and explicit display of vulnerability. We discuss the relationship of our findings to literature in visual sociology, in mental health self disclosure, and implications for the design of health interventions.},

But if vibrotactile actuation is tightly coupled to users' actions, it can be used to create much richer haptic experiences. It is not well understood, however, how this coupling should be done or which vibrotactile parameters create which experiences. To investigate how actuation parameters relate to haptic experiences, we built a physical slider with minimal native friction, a vibrotactile actuator and an integrated position sensor. By vibrating the slider as it is moved, we create an experience of texture between the sliding element and its track. We conducted a magnitude estimation experiment to map how granularity, amplitude and timbre relate to the experiences of roughness, adhesiveness, sharpness and bumpiness. We found that amplitude influences the strength of the perceived texture, while variations in granularity and timbre create distinct experiences. Our study underlines the importance of action in haptic perception and suggests strategies for deploying such tightly coupled feedback in everyday devices.},

The new context dictates how carefully a clip must be prepared, so our end-to-end approach enables previewing and easy iteration. We convert static-camera videos into loopable sequences, synthesizing them in response to simple end-user requests. This is hard because a) users want essentially semantic-level control over the synthesized video content, and b) automatic loop-finding is brittle and leaves users limited opportunity to work through problems. We propose a human-in-the-loop system where adding effort gives the user progressively more creative control.

In the absence of a caregiver, users must enter reminders themselves if the apps are going to help them. Poor memory and apathy associated with ABI can result in failure to initiate such configuration behaviour and the benefits of reminder apps are lost. ForgetMeNot takes a novel approach to address this problem by periodically encouraging the user to enter reminders with unsolicited prompts (UPs). An in situ case study investigated the experience of using a reminding app for people with ABI and tested UPs as a potential solution to initiating reminder entry. Three people with severe ABI living in a post-acute rehabilitation hospital used the app in their everyday lives for four weeks to collect real usage data. Field observations illustrated how difficulties with motivation, insight into memory difficulties and anxiety impact reminder app use in a rehabilitation setting. Results showed that when 6 UPs were presented throughout the day, reminder-setting increased, showing UPs are an important addition to reminder applications for people with ABI. This study demonstrates that barriers to technology use can be resolved in practice when software is developed with an understanding of the issues experienced by the user group.},

Our pneumatic prototype emits short and long term flows with a minimum delay and is able to animate wind sources in 3D space around the user's head. To get insights on how airflow can be used in VR and how such a device should be designed, we arranged focus groups and discussed the topic.

In current HCI research, those particulars are almost always taken to be 'things' artefacts or singular systems. We argue that this emphasis may have come at a cost that can be described as a loss of identity; interaction design research was never primarily concerned with the design of artefacts, but with how humans act and interact with each other with and through artefacts. We propose a complementary perspective by looking at design projects and traditions where the 'ultimate particulars' can be considered to be activities rather than things. The article is concerned with how knowledge needs to be articulated in the scholarly engagement with such design practices. We argue that engagement with activity-centric design gets design research one step closer towards understanding salient contemporary design practices and what Buchanan calls 'environmental design'.},

Due to their uncertainty, such forecasts can differ by provider. To make an informed decision, many people compare several forecasts, which is a time-consuming and cumbersome task. To facilitate comparison, we identified three aggregation mechanisms for forecasts: manual comparison and two mechanisms of computational aggregation. In a survey, we compared the mechanisms using different representations. We then developed a weather application to evaluate the most promising candidates in a real-world study. Our results show that aggregation increases users' confidence in uncertain data, independent of the type of representation. Further, we find that for daily events, users prefer to use computationally aggregated forecasts. However, for high-stakes events, they prefer manual comparison. We discuss how our findings inform the design of improved interfaces for comparison of uncertain data, including non-weather purposes.},

Rather than trying to do away with the gap between ethnography and design by seamlessly integrating the two processes, we reworked the relationship between ethnography and design by closing the gap in the temporal workflows while simultaneously maintaining a distinction in the performance of the two roles.

We investigate how auditory pre-alerts that occur well before the handover request impact the success of the handover in a dual task scenario. In a study with a driving simulator, drivers perform tasks on their phone while the car is in an autonomous mode. They receive a repeated burst audio pre-alert or an increasing pulse audio pre-alert preceding the standard warning for immediate handover. Results show that pre-alerts caused people to look more at the road before the handover occurred, and to disengage from the secondary task earlier, compared to when there was no pre-alert. This resulted in safer handover situations. Increasing pulse pre-alerts show particular promise due to their communication of urgency. Our detailed analysis informs the design and evaluation of alerts in safety-critical systems with automation.},

The system aims to support a higher-level flow of interaction by 'chunking' the traditionally disjoint steps of selection and action into unified selection-action phrases. This holistic goal led us to address two complementary aspects: SELECTION, for which we devise a new technique known as the Zoom-Catcher that integrates pinch-to-zoom and selection in a single gesture for fluidly selecting and acting on content; plus: ACTION, where we demonstrate how this addresses the combined issues of navigating, selecting, and manipulating content. In particular, the designer can transform select ink strokes in flexible and easily-reversible representations via semantic, structural, and temporal axes of movement that are defined as conceptual 'moves' relative to the specified content. This approach dovetails zooming with lightweight specification of scope as well as the evocation of context-appropriate commands, at-hand, in a location-independent manner. This establishes powerful new primitives that can help to scaffold higher-level tasks, thereby unleashing the expressive power of ink in a compelling manner.},

In this paper, we look to the historical scholarship on piecework — a similar trend of work decomposition, distribution, and payment that was popular at the turn of the 20th century — to understand how these questions might play out with modern on-demand work. We identify the mechanisms that enabled and limited piecework historically, and identify whether on-demand work faces the same pitfalls or might differentiate itself. This approach introduces theoretical grounding that can help address some of the most persistent questions in crowd work, and suggests design interventions that learn from history rather than repeat it.},

The musician composes fragments of music that can be played back with varying levels of embellishment, disguise and looseness to trigger digital interactions. We collaborated with twenty-three musicians, spanning professionals to amateurs and working with a variety of instruments. We chart the rapid evolution of the system to meet their needs as they strove to integrate music recognition technology into their performance practice, introducing multiple features to enable them to trade-off reliability with musical expression. Collectively, these support the idea of deliberately introducing "looseness" into interactive systems by addressing the three key challenges of control, feedback and attunement, and highlight the potential role for written notations in other recognition-based systems.},

The advent of non-rectangular displays questions this knowledge. In this paper we study how traditional content layouts can be adapted to fit different non-rectangular displays. We performed a first qualitative study where graphic designers fitted text and images into different non-rectangular displays. From the analysis of their output we generalize and adapt ten composition principles that have been proposed in the literature for rectangular displays. We evaluate the revised principles through a paired comparison questionnaire where 57 participants compared pairs of layouts. Using the Bradley-Terry-Luce model to analyze our data we show that some results contradict current conventions on visual design for rectangular displays. We then extracted the most interesting cases and conducted a follow up study with additional shapes to investigate how the principles generalize. From these results we propose a set of guidelines for designing visual content for non-rectangular displays.},

Word clarity quantifies the extent to which a word is likely to confuse with other words on a keyboard. We formally define word clarity, derive equations calculating it, and both theoretically and empirically show that word clarity has a significant effect on text entry performance: it can yield up to 26.4% difference in error rate, and 25% difference in input speed. We later propose a Pareto optimization method for sampling test sets with different sizes, which optimizes the word clarity and bigram representativeness, and memorability of the test set. The obtained test sets are published on the Internet.},

Although blind people can label appliances with Braille stickers, doing so generally requires sighted assistance to identify the original functions and apply the labels. We introduce Facade - a crowdsourced fabrication pipeline to help blind people independently make physical interfaces accessible by adding a 3D printed augmentation of tactile buttons overlaying the original panel. Facade users capture a photo of the appliance with a readily available fiducial marker (a dollar bill) for recovering size information. This image is sent to multiple crowd workers, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface. Facade then generates a 3D model for a layer of tactile and pressable buttons that fits over the original controls. Finally, a home 3D printer or commercial service fabricates the layer, which is then aligned and attached to the interface by the blind person. We demonstrate the viability of Facade in a study with 11 blind participants.},

We present three design case studies that were executed in a time span of three years: a baby sleep project; a pregnancy project; and a baby bottle-feeding project. Through a retrospective analysis we conclude that the approach adopted in these cases progressed from complete separation of UXR and design activities to design-inclusive UXR in which design forms an integral part of research. This is reflected by a rearrangement of project activities to identify, envision, enable and evaluate user experiences. Previously the UXR (identify and evaluate) and design (envision and enable) activities were executed sequentially. Now, these four project activities merge in studying design interventions in context over a prolonged time, to iteratively explore and advance UX design qualities.},

The test asked participants to examine pairs of photographed meals and identify meals higher in a specific macronutrient (e.g., carbohydrate). After each answer, participants received no feedback on the accuracy of their answers, viewed proportions of peers choosing each response, received correctness feedback from an expert dietitian with or without expert-generated explanations, or received correctness feedback with crowd-generated explanations. The results showed that neither viewing peer responses nor correctness feedback alone improved learning. However, correctness feedback with explanations (i.e., modeling) led to significant learning gains, with no significant difference between explanations generated by experts or peers. This suggests the importance of explanations in social computing-based casual learning about nutrition and the potential for scaling this approach via crowdsourcing.},

Using this approach, we were able to include autistic children in dedicated evaluation phases through the co-definition of goals and methods, joint processes of data gathering and the co-interpretation of results.

These lend HCI an analytic vocabulary for understanding why markets may succeed or struggle. Building on prior empirical work, we apply these concepts to compare two well-known network hospitality platforms, Couchsurfing and Airbnb. As a second illustrative case, we use market design to shed light on the challenges experienced by smaller-scale peer-to-peer marketplaces for lending, renting, and selling physical goods. To conclude, we discuss how this kind of analysis can make conceptual, evaluative, and generative contributions to the study and design of exchange platforms and other socio-technical systems.},

 abstract = {Drones are increasingly being used for various purposes from recording footage in inaccessible areas to delivering packages. A rise in drone usage introduces privacy and security concerns about flying boundaries, what data drones collect in public and private spaces, and how that data is stored and disseminated. However, commercial and personal drone regulations focusing on privacy and security have been fairly minimal in the USA. To inform privacy and security guidelines for drone design and regulation, we need to understand users' perceptions about drones, privacy and security. In this paper, we describe a laboratory study with 20 participants who interacted with a real or model drone to elicit user perceptions of privacy and security issues around drones. We present our results, discuss the implications of our work and make recommendations to improve drone design and regulations that enhance individual privacy and security.},

 abstract = {We propose a novel method of spatial audio rendering using ultrasound. An ultrasonic phased array generates one or more focal points in air, and they act as point sources of audible sound when the ultrasound waves are modulated. Our sound-point loudspeaker has two major advantages over conventional ultrasound-based sound-beam (superdirectional) loudspeakers. The higher audience selectivity means that our sound-point loudspeaker can deliver sound to the ears of the target person, whereas a sound-beam loudspeaker delivers sound to not only the target person but also other persons standing in the same direction. The other advantage is lower exposure to ultrasound; while an audible sound beam travels along an ultrasonic beam in a soundbeam loudspeaker, audible sound can be heard along the direction perpendicular to the ultrasonic beam in our soundpoint loudspeaker. This paper reports the principles of our sound-point loudspeaker, prototype construction, evaluation, and applications.},

For example, emailing many people for feedback requires either impersonal surveys or manual effort to hold many similar conversations. To scale personalized conversations, we introduce techniques that exploit similarities across conversations to recycle relevant parts of previous conversations. These techniques reduce the authoring burden, save senders' time, and maintain recipient engagement through personalized responses. We introduce MyriadHub, a mail client where users start conversations and then crowd workers extract underlying conversational patterns and rules to accelerate responses to future similar emails. In a within-subjects experiment comparing MyriadHub to existing mass email techniques, senders spent significantly less time planning events with MyriadHub. In a second experiment comparing MyriadHub to a standard email survey, MyriadHub doubled the recipients' response rate and tripled the number of words in their responses.},

Users interact with the system via email, delegating their scheduling needs to the system as if it were a human personal assistant. Common scheduling scenarios are broken down using well-defined workflows and completed as a series of microtasks that are automated when possible and executed by a human otherwise. Unusual scenarios fall back to a trained human assistant executing an unstructured macrotask. We describe the iterative approach we used to develop Calendar.help, and share the lessons learned from scheduling thousands of meetings during a year of real-world deployments.

To promote such development, different strategies can be used to implement game mechanics that change player's in-game behavior. One of such strategies is enticing players to take action through incentives akin to game achievements. We explored if this strategy could be used to influence players' proxemic behavior in the Interactive Tag Playground, an installation that enhances the traditional game of tag. We placed the ITP in an art gallery, observed hundreds of play sessions, and refined the mechanics, which consisted in projecting collectible particles around the tagger that upon collection by runners resulted only in the embellishment of their circles. We implemented the refined mechanics in a study with 48 children. The playground automatically collected the players' positions, and analyses show that runners got closer to and moved more towards taggers when using our enticing strategy. This suggests an enticing strategy can be used to influence physical in-game behavior.},

In this paper, we leverage The American Voter as an analysis framework in the realm of computational political science, employing the factors of party, personality, and policy to structure the analysis of public discourse on online social media during the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries. Our analysis of 50 million tweets reveals the continuing importance of these three factors; our understanding is also enriched by the application of sentiment analysis techniques. The overwhelmingly negative sentiment of conversations surrounding 10 major presidential candidates reveals more "crosstalk" from Democratic leaning users towards Republican candidates, and less vice-versa. We uncover the lack of moderation as the most discussed personality dimension during this campaign season, as the political field becomes more extreme - Clinton and Rubio are perceived as moderate, while Trump, Sanders, and Cruz are not. While the most discussed issues are foreign policy and immigration, Republicans tweet more about abortion than Democrats who tweet more about gay rights than Republicans. Finally, we illustrate the importance of multifaceted political discourse analysis by applying regression to quantify the impact of party, personality, and policy on national polls.},

Do people trust this promise and adjust their privacy decisions if the interfaces through which they interact make differential privacy less opaque? In a study with 228 participants, we measured comfort, understanding, and trust using a variant of differential privacy known as Randomized Response Technique (RRT). We found that allowing individuals to see the amount of obfuscation applied to their responses increased their trust in the privacy-protecting mechanism. However, participants who associated obfuscating privacy mechanisms with deception did not make the "safest" privacy decisions, even as they demonstrated an understanding of RRT. We demonstrate that prudent privacy-related decisions can be cultivated with simple explanations of usable privacy.},

Our findings suggest that 69% of exergames papers citing this study misrepresent the findings, demonstrating a systematic failure of scholarship in exergames research. We argue that exergaming research should cease focusing on games as treatment for obesity, and that HCI publications should demand more critical and scholarly engagement with research from outside HCI.},

Using a contextual inquiry approach (n=6 blind/visually impaired), we found that blind people place a lot of trust in automatically generated captions, filling in details to resolve differences between an image's context and an incongruent caption. We built on this in-person study with a second, larger online experiment (n=100 blind/visually impaired) to investigate the role of phrasing in encouraging trust or skepticism in captions. We found that captions emphasizing the probability of error, rather than correctness, encouraged people to attribute incongruence to an incorrect caption, rather than missing details. Where existing research has focused on encouraging trust in intelligent systems, we conclude by challenging this assumption and consider the benefits of encouraging appropriate skepticism.},

Results indicated that primary users' judgments of relational satisfaction with annoyers were influenced by annoyers' narcissistic personality and their overall propensity for posting overly self-focused content. Commitment affected primary users' use of both passive "unfollowing" and active "unfriending" in response to annoyers' behavior. Decisions to maintain or terminate online friendships are related to judgments and actions of both partners. Overall, these results emphasize the dyadic nature of relational maintenance and termination processes in online environments, and the importance of studying them as such.},

 abstract = {Time-consuming and complicated best describe the current state of the Information Extraction (IE) field. Machine learning approaches to IE require large collections of labeled datasets that are difficult to create and use obscure mathematical models, occasionally returning unwanted results that are unexplainable. Rule-based approaches, while resulting in easy-to-understand IE rules, are still time-consuming and labor-intensive. SEER combines the best of these two approaches: a learning model for IE rules based on a small number of user-specified examples. In this paper, we explain the design behind SEER and present a user study comparing our system against a commercially available tool in which users create IE rules manually. Our results show that SEER helps users complete text extraction tasks more quickly, as well as more accurately.},

Using the Internet-enhanced self-disclosure hypothesis (ISDH) as a framework, we conducted an online survey of 274 Grindr users. Serial mediation analysis showed support for the ISDH, suggesting that Grindr use was negatively associated with loneliness. Intimate self-disclosure and internalized homophobia mediated the relationship between Grindr use and loneliness, but sexting had no relationship with internalized homophobia or loneliness. We discuss implications for the ISDH, Grindr, self-disclosure, and sexting.},

Using a mixed-methods evaluation, we demonstrate that this software leaves students with significantly increased knowledge about HIV and reduced stigma toward individuals infected with the virus. Validating the effectiveness of TeachAIDS in circumventing taboos, students report comfort in learning from the software, and it has since been deployed in tens of thousands of schools throughout India.

Through evaluation during an HCI conference (Naudience=11, Npresenters=3) we found that EngageMeter provides value to presenters (a) in real-time, since it allows reacting to current engagement scores by changing tone or adding pauses, and (b) in post-hoc, since presenters can adjust their slides and embed extra elements. We discuss how EngageMeter can be used in collocated and distributed audience sensing as well as how it can aid presenters in long term use.},

Recent research has been primarily constructive (oriented to building of systems) or phenomenon-driven (serving attempts to understand interactions in collocated CMC). The paper contributes a theory-driven approach and examines collocated CMC as a Habermasean "public sphere": a space that supports inclusive, civil, and rational discussion. An in-the-wild experimental study comparing CMC with face-to-face (F2F) communication enabled ascertaining that CMC is more inclusive than F2F communication. Respectfulness levels did not differ but were established differently: via collective construction of a common narrative in F2F and through quick reactions in CMC. Similarly, while rationality figures were on a par, F2F communication allowed participants to justify their claims better. The article discusses how a theory-based approach can strengthen phenomenon-driven research with new conceptual frames and measurement tools, and steer constructive research with a normative framework.},

Crisis Informatics literature examines interconnections of people, organizations, and IT during crisis events. However, how people use technology to cope with disease crises (outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics) remains understudied. We investigate how individuals used social media in response to the outbreak of Zika, focusing on travel-related decisions. We found that extreme uncertainty and ambiguity characterized the Zika virus crisis. To cope, people turned to social media for information gathering and social learning geared towards personal risk assessment and modifying decisions when dealing with partial and conflicting information about Zika. In particular, individuals sought local information and used socially informed logical reasoning to deduce the risk at a specific locale. We conclude with implications for designing information systems to support individual risk assessment and decision-making when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity during public health crises.},

Using DIY fabrication and assembly, we explore how simple 1-DOF robots can express affect with economy and user customizability, leveraging open-source designs. We developed low-cost techniques for coupled iteration of a simple robot's body and behaviour, and evaluated its potential to display emotion. Through two user studies, we (1) validated these CuddleBits' ability to express emotions (N=20); (2) sourced a corpus of 72 robot emotion behaviours from participants (N=10); and (3) analyzed it to link underlying parameters to emotional perception (N=14). We found that CuddleBits can express arousal (activation), and to a lesser degree valence (pleasantness). We also show how a sketch-refine paradigm combined with DIY fabrication and novel input methods enable parametric design of physical emotion display, and discuss how mastering this parsimonious case can give insight into layering simple behaviours in more complex robots.},

 abstract = {Software developers rely on support from a variety of resources---including other developers---but the coordination cost of finding another developer with relevant experience, explaining the context of the problem, composing a specific help request, and providing access to relevant code is prohibitively high for all but the largest of tasks. Existing technologies for synchronous communication (e.g. voice chat) have high scheduling costs, and asynchronous communication tools (e.g. forums) require developers to carefully describe their code context to yield useful responses. This paper introduces Codeon, a system that enables more effective task hand-off between end-user developers and remote helpers by allowing asynchronous responses to on-demand requests. With Codeon, developers can request help by speaking their requests aloud within the context of their IDE. Codeon automatically captures the relevant code context and allows remote helpers to respond with high-level descriptions, code annotations, code snippets, and natural language explanations. Developers can then immediately view and integrate these responses into their code. In this paper, we describe Codeon, the studies that guided its design, and our evaluation that its effectiveness as a support tool. In our evaluation, developers using Codeon completed nearly twice as many tasks as those who used state-of-the-art synchronous video and code sharing tools, by reducing the coordination costs of seeking assistance from other developers.},

Our goal is to help users create gestures that are both personally memorable and reliably recognized by a touch-enabled mobile device. We address these competing requirements with two dynamic guides that use progressive feedforward to interactively visualize the "negative space" of unused gestures: the Pathward technique suggests four possible completions to the current gesture, and the Fieldward technique uses color gradients to reveal optimal directions for creating recognizable gestures. We ran a two-part experiment in which 27 participants each created 42 personal gesture shortcuts on a smartphone, using Pathward, Fieldward or No Feedforward. The Fieldward technique best supported the most common user strategy, i.e. to create a memorable gesture first and then adapt it to be recognized by the system. Users preferred the Fieldward technique to Pathward or No Feedforward, and remembered gestures more easily when using the technique. Dynamic guides can help developers design novel gesture vocabularies and support users as they design custom gestures for mobile applications.},

We extracted six themes that manifested this tension and three overarching concepts, correctness, community, and code, which help make sense of and synthesize the themes.

Contrary to our expectations, we did not find evidence that adding data semantics increases accuracy, and further found that our backstory narratives can even decrease accuracy. Adding dataset semantics can however increase attention and provide subjective benefits in terms of confidence, perceived easiness, task enjoyability and perceived usefulness of the visualization. Nevertheless, our backstory narratives did not appear to provide additional subjective benefits.

We draw from our ethnographic engagements with tech entrepreneurial efforts in Ghana, China, and Jamaica to unpack the stakes involved in their uptake, showing that while local actors produce situated alternatives, their work nevertheless often results in a continued valorization of these seemingly universal methods. We argue that design methods shape not only use practices, but have consequences for the life worlds of professional designers. This includes how they impact personal and national identities, confer legitimacy in transnational innovation circles, and secure access to social and economic resources.

 abstract = {Motivated by mobile devices' growing demand for connectivity, and concern in HCI with the energy intensity and sustainability of networked services, in this paper we reveal the impact of applications on smartphones and tablets in terms of network demand and time use. Using a detailed mixed methods study with eight participants, we first provide an account of how data demand has meaning and utility in our participants' social practices, and the timing and relative impacts of these. We then assess the scale of this demand by drawing comparison between our fine-grained observations and a more representative dataset of 398 devices from the Device Analyzer corpus. Our results highlight the significant categories of data demanding practice, and the identification of where changes in app time and duration of use might reduce or shift demand to reduce services' impacts.},

 abstract = {SUGILITE is a new programming-by-demonstration (PBD) system that enables users to create automation on smartphones. SUGILITE uses Android's accessibility API to support automating arbitrary tasks in any Android app (or even across multiple apps). When the user gives verbal commands that SUGILITE does not know how to execute, the user can demonstrate by directly manipulating the regular apps' user interface. By leveraging the verbal instructions, the demonstrated procedures, and the apps? UI hierarchy structures, SUGILITE can automatically generalize the script from the recorded actions, so SUGILITE learns how to perform tasks with different variations and parameters from a single demonstration. Extensive error handling and context checking support forking the script when new situations are encountered, and provide robustness if the apps change their user interface. Our lab study suggests that users with little or no programming knowledge can successfully automate smartphone tasks using SUGILITE.},

We push the boundaries for around device interactions to facilitate an entire smartphone application: browsing through large information lists to make a decision. To this end, we present AirPanes, a novel technique that allows two-handed in-air interactions, conjointly with touch input to perform analytic tasks, such as making a purchase decision. AirPanes resolves the inefficiencies of having to switch between multiple views or panes in common smartphone applications. We explore the design factors that make AirPanes efficient. In a controlled study, we find that AirPanes is on average 50% more efficient that standard touch input for an analytic task. We offer recommendations for implementing AirPanes in a broad range of applications.},

A 21-day study was conducted with 158 participants (younger and older Internet users). Data collection took place at the participants' homes to increase ecological validity. Our results show that older women were the most vulnerable group to phishing attacks. While younger adults were most susceptible to scarcity, older adults were most susceptible to reciprocation. Further, there was a discrepancy, particularly among older users, between self-reported susceptibility awareness and their behavior during the intervention. Our results show the need for demographic personalization for warnings, training and educational tools in targeting the specifics of the older adult population.},

A reasonably accurate estimation of fatigue requires an estimate of an individual's strength. However, there is no easy-to-access method to measure individual strength to accommodate inter-individual differences. Furthermore, fatigue is influenced by both psychological and physiological factors, but no current HCI model provides good estimates of cumulative subjective fatigue. We present a new, simple method to estimate the maximum shoulder torque through a mid-air pointing task, which agrees with direct strength measurements. We then introduce a cumulative fatigue model informed by subjective and biomechanical measures. We evaluate the performance of the model in estimating cumulative subjective fatigue in mid-air interaction by performing multiple cross-validations and a comparison with an existing fatigue metric. Finally, we discuss the potential of our approach for real-time evaluation of subjective fatigue as well as future challenges.},

As technologies are embedded in the body, the boundary between human and machine starts to blur. We find that GrinderTech members, through the design and making of technologies for embedding, do so as a means to move beyond social and gendered binary constructions-or, societal norms that are practiced and performed, and re-enforced through language, as a way of creating power differentials in society, e.g. citizen/scientist and man/woman. Moreover, their motivations for designing and making these devices reflects their desire to re-imagine society.

To explore the opportunities for a hospital-based peer support system, we administered a survey to 146 pediatric patients and caregivers, and conducted semi-structured interviews with twelve patients and three caregivers in a children's hospital. Our analysis revealed that hospitalized individuals need peer support for five key purposes: (1) to ask about medical details-such as procedures, treatments, and medications; (2) to learn about healthcare providers; (3) to report and prevent medical errors; (4) to exchange emotional support; and (5) to manage their time in the hospital. In this paper, we examine these themes and describe potential barriers to using a hospital-based peer support system.

We explore Thumb + Pen interactions that support simultaneous pen and touch interaction, with both hands, in such situations. Our approach engages the thumb of the device-holding hand, such that the thumb interacts with the touch screen in an indirect manner, thereby complementing the direct input provided by the preferred hand. For instance, the thumb can determine how pen actions (articulated with the opposite hand) are interpreted. Alternatively, the pen can point at an object, while the thumb manipulates one or more of its parameters through indirect touch. Our techniques integrate concepts in a novel way that derive from marking menus, spring-loaded modes, indirect input, and multi-touch conventions. Our overall approach takes the form of a set of probes, each representing a meaningfully distinct class of application. They serve as an initial exploration of the design space at a level which will help determine the feasibility of supporting bimanual interaction in such contexts, and the viability of the Thumb + Pen techniques in so doing.},

 abstract = {Despite rapid advances in 3D printing, fabricating large, durable and robust artifacts is impractical with current technology. We focus on a particularly challenging environment-scale artifact: rock climbing routes. We propose a prototype fabrication method to replicate part of an outdoor climbing route and enable the same sensorimotor experience in an indoor gym. We start with 3D reconstruction of the rock wall using multi-view stereo and use reference videos of a climber in action to identify localized rock features that are necessary for ascent. We create 3D models akin to traditional indoor climbing holds, fabricated using rapid prototyping, molding and casting techniques. This results in robust holds accurately replicating the features and configuration of the original rock route. Validation was performed on two rock climbing sites in New Hampshire and Utah. We verified our results by comparing climbers' moves on the indoor replicas and original outdoor routes.},

In the context of these activities, our robots not only display autonomous motion and act as tangible interfaces, but are also usable as haptic devices in order to exploit, for instance, kinesthetic learning. In this article, we present the design and analysis of the haptic interaction module of the Cellulo robots. We first detail our hardware and controller design that is low-cost and versatile. Then, we describe the task-based experimental procedure to evaluate the robot's haptic abilities. We show that our robot is usable in most of the tested tasks and extract perceptive and manipulative guidelines for the design of haptic elements to be integrated in future learning activities. We conclude with limitations of the system and future work.},

Despite the long history (and recent renaissance) of digital pens, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey of what types of marks people make and what motivates them to use ink-both analog and digital in daily life. To capture the diversity of inking behaviors and tease out the unique affordances of pen-and ink, we conducted a diary study with 26 participants from diverse backgrounds. From analysis of 493 diary entries we identified 8 analog pen-and-ink activities, and 9 affordances of pens. We contextualized and contrasted these findings using a survey with 1,633 respondents and a follow-up diary study with 30 participants, observing digital pens. Our analysis reveals gaps and research opportunities based on pen affordances not yet fully explored in the literature.},

In addition, mobilizable connectors are suggested to support flexible assembly, which can be revised, recycled, and reused to facilitate short iterations.

We explore such a conflict in an India-based multinational organization using an eight-month interpretive case study. Based on grounded analysis, we present a narrative account of how consultants, on contract for managing the deployment and making necessary adjustments, used discourse as a means of shaping user understanding about the features and practices embedded in the underlying system, which were not initially realized through the interface. Sustained user resistance to this shaping led to a negotiated compromise and adaptation of the system to incorporate local work culture. Our findings allow us to explore the under-theorized role of discursive power within an implementer-user-technology trio, and illustrate the feedback utility of user resistance in developing culturally-inclusive designs.},

However, very little is known about how these population biases affect the many algorithms that rely on social media data. Focusing on the case study of geolocation inference algorithms and their performance across the urban-rural spectrum, we establish that these algorithms exhibit significantly worse performance for underrepresented populations (i.e. rural users). We further establish that this finding is robust across both text- and network-based algorithm designs. However, we also show that some of this bias can be attributed to the design of algorithms themselves rather than population biases in the underlying data sources. For instance, in some cases, algorithms perform badly for rural users even when we substantially overcorrect for population biases by training exclusively on rural data. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design and study of social media-based algorithms.},

A key reason for this is that common forms of evaluation used in HCI make it difficult to effectively accumulate-and use-knowledge across research projects. This paper proposes a strategy for HCI research on behavior change that retains the field's focus on novel technical contributions while enabling accumulation of evidence that can increase impact of individual research projects both in HCI and the broader behavior-change science. The core of this strategy is an emphasis on the discovery of causal effects of individual components of behavior-change technologies and the precise ways in which those effects vary with individual differences, design choices, and contexts in which those technologies are used.},

This in-depth interview study explores self-tracking practices in multiple sclerosis (MS), a complex neurological disease that causes physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms. Our findings illustrate that when faced the unpredictable and degenerative nature of MS, individuals regained a sense of control by intertwining self-care practices with different self-tracking technologies. They engaged in disease monitoring, fitness tracking, and life journaling to quantify the body and care for the mind. We focus attention on the role of emotional wellbeing and the experience of control in self-tracking and managing MS. Finally, we discuss in which ways self-tracking technologies could support the experiential nature of control and foster mindful experiences rather than focusing only on tracking primary disease indicators.},

A correct resolution should only permit the expected access, while maintaining the protection against illegal access. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that correct resolutions are occasional---sysadmins often grant too much access (known as security misconfigurations) to allow the denied access, posing severe security risks. This paper presents a quantitative study on real-world practices of resolving access-denied issues, with a particular focus on how and why security misconfigurations are introduced during problem solving. We characterize the real-world security misconfigurations introduced in the field, and show that many of these misconfigurations were the results of trial-and-error practices commonly adopted by sysadmins to work around access denials. We argue that the lack of adequate feedback information is one fundamental reason that prevents sysadmins from developing precise understanding and thus induces trial and error. Our study on access-denied messages shows that many of today's software systems miss the opportunities for providing adequate feedback information, imposing unnecessary obstacles to correct resolutions.},

It extends previous approaches through multi-electrode sensing and high-speed wireless data collection for embedded devices. We implement the sensing in devices and furniture, where unique electrode configurations generate characteristic profiles based on user's unique electrical properties.

 abstract = {Touch latency has been shown to deteriorate users' performances at levels as low as 25 ms, but this was tested only in short experimental sessions. Real life usage of touchscreens covers much longer periods. It provides training which could lead to reduce the impact of latency. We investigate users' ability to compensate for touch latency with training. Two groups of participants were trained on a tracking task during ten different days over two weeks with either high or low latency. The gap of performances between the two groups, observed at the beginning of the experiment, was reduced by 54 % after training. Users can thus compensate for latency, at least partially. These results nuance the negative effects of touch latency reported in previous work. They suggest that long-term studies could provide better insights on users' behaviors when dealing with touch latency.},

Nevertheless, we extract from the literature distinct and highly developed concepts, for instance viewing interaction as dialogue, transmission, optimal behavior, embodiment, and tool use. Importantly, these concepts are associated with different scopes and ways of construing the causal relationships between the human and the computer. This affects their ability to inform empirical studies and design. Based on this discussion, we list desiderata for future work on interaction, emphasizing the need to improve scope and specificity, to better account for the effects and agency that computers have in interaction, and to generate strong propositions about interaction.},

Each artifact was designed to illustrate a particular property of light communication ranging from inner workings of transmission protocols to properties of light in itself. The set was used in two small scale workshops where users played around with the artifacts and afterward were interviewed about their experiences. Interviews and observations from the workshops suggest that users gained insights into the material properties of light communication and were also inspired to think of creative uses for VLC based on those insights},

However, the relation between the printed structure and the parameters causing the printing error is unclear. In this paper, we focus on the height position of the extruder and the amount of extruded material, and explore the combination of these parameters to enhance the capability of FDM. By extending an equation that calculates the amount of material from the layer height, we investigate the behavior and structure of material extruded from various height positions. On the basis of experimental results, the printed structure is classified into six categories according to the structural feature. We describe these structural features and demonstrate examples with new inherent expressions for FDM.},

Other applications require laborious manual input that a skilled developer could automate if the application were scriptable. This paper presents Genie, a system that automatically reverse engineers an abstract model of the underlying commands in a web application, then enables interaction with that functionality through alternative interfaces and other input modalities (e.g., speech, keyboard, or command line input). Genie comprises an abstract model of command properties, behaviors, and dependencies as well as algorithms that reverse engineer this model from an existing web application through static and dynamic program analysis. We evaluate Genie by developing several interfaces that automatically add support for speech, keyboard, and command line input to arbitrary web applications.},

Hotaru has been shown in festivals and also formally playtested with 62 individuals. To more fully articulate the Interdependent Wearables strong concept, we compared this system's design with wearable and embodied systems for play and other purposes, and drew upon relevant HCI theory.

Many real-world objects cannot easily be equipped with displays or actuators in order to change their shape. While common approaches such as projection mapping enable changing the appearance of objects without modifying them, certain surface properties (e.g. highly reflective or transparent surfaces) can make employing these techniques difficult. In this work, we present a conceptual design exploration on how the appearance of an object can be changed by solely altering the space around it, rather than the object itself. In a proof-of-concept implementation, we place objects onto a tabletop display and track them together with users to display perspective-corrected 3D graphics for augmentation. This enables controlling properties such as the perceived size, color, or shape of objects. We characterize the design space of our approach and demonstrate potential applications. For example, we change the contour of a wallet to notify users when their bank account is debited. We envision our approach to gain in importance with increasing ubiquity of display surfaces.},

By simple clicks on mobile apps like Hipstamatic and Instagram, users can easily apply digital filters to their pictures to create effects such as faux-vintage and light leaks. To understand the potential impacts of photo filters, we conducted an online experiment and investigated how the use of the black-and-white and film-style photo filters changed viewers' perceptions and descriptions of photographs. We found that photo filters substantially increased viewers' perceived temporal distances to photographs. Participants also tended to describe analogue-style photos more interpretively and tentatively than unfiltered ones, indicating an increase in construal levels. We suggest that the widely used photo filter is not just a tool to change aesthetics; it also adds a layer of history, meaning, and defamiliarization to photographs, allowing users to construct a mental distance in images that deviates from everyday experiences. We offer insights into the psychology of visual styles and implications for designing filter apps and photo-sharing platforms.},

This paper presents the deployment of Chorus - a mealtime technology that orchestrates the sharing of personal devices and stories during family mealtimes, explores related content from all participants' devices, and supports revisiting previously shared content. A three-week field deployment with seven families shows that Chorus augments family interactions through sharing contents of personal and familial significance, supports togetherness and in-depth discussion by combining resources from multiple devices, helps to broach sensitive topics into familial conversation, and encourages participation from all family members including children. We discuss implications of this research and reflect on design choices and opportunities that can further enhance the family mealtime experience.},

 abstract = {Visual data analysis involves both open-ended and focused exploration. Manual chart specification tools support question answering, but are often tedious for early-stage exploration where systematic data coverage is needed. Visualization recommenders can encourage broad coverage, but irrelevant suggestions may distract users once they commit to specific questions. We present Voyager 2, a mixed-initiative system that blends manual and automated chart specification to help analysts engage in both open-ended exploration and targeted question answering. We contribute two partial specification interfaces: wildcards let users specify multiple charts in parallel, while related views suggest visualizations relevant to the currently specified chart. We present our interface design and applications of the CompassQL visualization query language to enable these interfaces. In a controlled study we find that Voyager 2 leads to increased data field coverage compared to a traditional specification tool, while still allowing analysts to flexibly drill-down and answer specific questions.},

Traditional approaches rely on direct and distributed sensing, most often by measuring one particular aspect of an environment with a special purpose sensor. This approach can be costly to deploy, hard to maintain, and aesthetically and socially obtrusive. In this work, we explore the notion of general purpose sensing, wherein a single enhanced sensor can indirectly monitor a large context, without direct instrumentation of objects. Further, through what we call Synthetic Sensors, we can virtualize raw sensor data into actionable feeds, whilst simultaneously mitigating immediate privacy issues. A series of structured, formative studies informed the development of our new sensor hardware and accompanying information architecture. We deployed our system across many months and environments, the results of which show the versatility, accuracy and potential utility of our approach.},

We conducted a mixed methods study including interviews (N = 42) and a survey (N = 223) to understand how people currently experience events using Facebook Live, Periscope, and Snapchat Live Stories. We identified four dimensions that make remote event viewing engaging: immersion, immediacy, interaction, and sociality. We find that both live streams and the more curated event content found on Snapchat are immersive and immediate, yet Snapchat Live Stories enable quickly switching among different views of the event. Live streams, on the other hand, offer real time interaction and sociality in a way that Snapchat Live Stories do not. However, the interaction's impact depends on comment volume, comment content, and relationship between viewer and broadcaster. We describe how people experience events remotely using these social media, and identify design opportunities around detecting exciting content, leveraging multiple viewpoints, and enabling interactivity to create engaging user experiences for remotely participating in events.},

We further compare these variants with an iterated version of the body tracking system with an extended tracking area. Our findings include an unexpected reluctance of passersby to use their mobile device in public, and the increased interactive area for body interaction resulting in increased engagement and spontaneous multi-user interaction, while removing the so-called 'landing effect'.

In this paper we introduce intersectionality as a framework for engaging with the complexity of users' "and authors" "identities", and situating these identities in relation to their contextual surroundings. We conducted a meta-review of identity representation in the CHI proceedings, collecting a corpus of 140 manuscripts on gender, ethnicity, race, class, and sexuality published between 1982-2016. Drawing on this corpus, we analyze how identity is constructed and represented in CHI research to examine intersectionality in a human-computer interaction (HCI) context. We find that previous identity-focused research tends to analyze one facet of identity at a time. Further, research on ethnicity and race lags behind research on gender and socio-economic class. We conclude this paper with recommendations for incorporating intersectionality in HCI research broadly, encouraging clear reporting of context and demographic information, inclusion of author disclosures, and deeper engagement with identity complexities.},

Therefore, the main goal of the presenter is to transport messages to the audience. The paper aims to improve the process of message transportation by providing audience-friendly and anticipatable gestures for the presenter to be used for 3D interaction with the content. For this purpose, we first gathered input from a potential audience through a Wizard of Oz experiment and implemented three coherent gesture sets using the Kinect. We conducted an online survey to evaluate the hypotheses regarding the anticipation rate and perceived user experience. In particular, two of our three gesture sets show tendencies to be intuitively predictable by an untrained, uninformed audience. As the three sets differ significantly in the anticipation level, we conclude that future improvements of such gestures would enhance the audience's ability to predict the intended actions even further.},

The baseline of visual feedback is as expected more precise (99.7% success rate) and faster (1.3 s) in comparison, but there are many applications in which visual feedback is not desirable or available due to lighting conditions, visual overload, or visual impairments. Mean final precision with HapticHead feedback on invisible targets is 2.3° compared to 0.8° with visual feedback.

We increase the expressive power of TouchTokens by introducing laser-cut lattice hinges in their design, so as to make them flexible. A new recognizer, that analyzes the micro-movements of the fingers that hold the tokens, enables the system to detect when a token is left on the surface rather than taken off it. It can also detect bend events that can be mapped to command triggers, and a squeezed state that can be used for quasi-modal interaction.},

Our study examines: (1) how touch input compares to an indirect pointing device (a mouse); (2) how performance compares across a range of standard interaction techniques; and (3) how these answers differ for users with and without motor impairments. While the touchscreen was faster than the mouse overall, only participants without motor impairments benefited from a lower error rate on the touchscreen.

In ThermoVR, we integrated five thermal feedback modules on the HMD to provide thermal feedback directly onto the user's face. We conducted evaluations with 15 participants using two approaches: Firstly, we provided simultaneously actuated thermal stimulations (hot and cold) as directional cues and evaluated the accuracy of recognition; secondly, we evaluated the overall immersive thermal experience that the users experience when provided with thermal feedback on the face. Results indicated that the recognition accuracy for cold stimuli were of approx. 89.5% accuracy while the accuracy for hot stimuli were 68.6%. Also, participants reported that they felt a higher level of immersion on the face when all modules were simultaneously stimulated (hot and cold). The presented applications demonstrate the ThermoVR's directional cueing and immersive experience.},

As thermal cameras become ubiquitous and affordable, we foresee a new form of threat to user privacy on mobile devices. Thermal cameras allow performing thermal attacks, where heat traces, resulting from authentication, can be used to reconstruct passwords. In this work we investigate in details the viability of exploiting thermal imaging to infer PINs and patterns on mobile devices. We present a study (N=18) where we evaluated how properties of PINs and patterns influence their thermal attacks resistance. We found that thermal attacks are indeed viable on mobile devices; overlapping patterns significantly decrease successful thermal attack rate from 100% to 16.67%, while PINs remain vulnerable (>72% success rate) even with duplicate digits. We conclude by recommendations for users and designers of authentication schemes on how to resist thermal attacks.},

This paper describes a study on the influence of typefaces using a blind Turing test-inspired approach. The study consisted of two user experiments. First, three different typefaces (OCR, Georgia, Helvetica) and three neutral dialogues between a human and a financial adviser were shown to participants. The second experiment applied the same study design but OCR font was substituted by Bradley font. For each of our two independent experiments, participants were shown three dialogue transcriptions and three typefaces counterbalanced. For each dialogue typeface pair, participants had to classify adviser conversations as human or chatbot-like. The results showed that machine-like typefaces biased users towards perceiving the adviser as machines but, unexpectedly, handwritten-like typefaces had not the opposite effect. Those effects were, however, influenced by the familiarity of the user to artificial intelligence and other participants' characteristics.},

Previous research has shown that a spatially-stable overview of the entire document can be substantially faster than any other navigation technique -- particularly when revisiting previous locations. However, the overview technique has only been tested in a limited laboratory study, so little is known about whether it works in more realistic contexts. To answer this question, we developed a PDF viewer that incorporates several document-navigation techniques, and carried out two studies. First, we ran a field experiment in which users carried out search tasks using an overview and other techniques -- on their own computers in a non-laboratory environment. Second, we ran a smaller field study in which people used our viewer (with choice of navigation techniques) for their own PDF tasks. In the field experiment, the overview was significantly and substantially faster than other techniques, and in the field study, the technique was frequently used for a wide variety of documents. Our work provides confirmation of the value of spatially stable overviews as a basis for document navigation.},

The research community has also enabled human position estimation and whole-body gestural interaction in instrumented environments. However, the broad field of capacitive sensing research has become fragmented by different approaches and terminology used across the various domains. This paper strives to unify the field by advocating consistent terminology and proposing a new taxonomy to classify capacitive sensing approaches. Our extensive survey provides an analysis and review of past research and identifies challenges for future work.

While there is a significant body of work on the use of personal navigation technologies in everyday scenarios, no research has examined these technologies' roles in catastrophic incidents. In this paper, we seek to address this gap in the literature. Borrowing techniques from public health research and communication studies, we construct a corpus of 158 detailed news reports of unique catastrophic incidents associated with personal navigation technologies. We then identify key themes in these incidents and the roles that navigation technologies played in them, e.g. missing road characteristics data contributed to over 25% of these incidents. With the goal of reducing casualties associated with personal navigation technologies, we outline implications for design and research that emerge from our results, e.g. advancing "space usage rule" mapping, incorporating weather information in routing, and improving visual and audio instructions in complex situations.},

These entrepreneurial actions wrestle against the affordances of the installed base of the Blockchain infrastructure, and take the shape of engaging or circumventing activities. These activities purposefully aim at either influencing or working around the enablers and constraints afforded by the Blockchain information infrastructure, as its installed base is gaining inertia. This study contributes to our understanding of the purpose of infrastructuring, seen from the perspective of heterogeneous entrepreneurial agents.

 abstract = {We propose a class of passive haptics that we call Sparse Haptic Proxy: a set of geometric primitives that simulate touch feedback in elaborate virtual reality scenes. Unlike previous passive haptics that replicate the virtual environment in physical space, a Sparse Haptic Proxy simulates a scene's detailed geometry by redirecting the user's hand to a matching primitive of the proxy. To bridge the divergence of the scene from the proxy, we augment an existing Haptic Retargeting technique with an on-the-fly target remapping: We predict users' intentions during interaction in the virtual space by analyzing their gaze and hand motions, and consequently redirect their hand to a matching part of the proxy. We conducted three user studies on haptic retargeting technique and implemented a system from three main results: 1) The maximum angle participants found acceptable for retargeting their hand is 40°, with an average rating of 4.6 out of 5. 2) Tracking participants' eye gaze reliably predicts their touch intentions (97.5%), even while simultaneously manipulating the user's hand-eye coordination for retargeting. 3) Participants preferred minimized retargeting distances over better-matching surfaces of our Sparse Haptic Proxy when receiving haptic feedback for single-finger touch input. We demonstrate our system with two virtual scenes: a flight cockpit and a room quest game. While their scene geometries differ substantially, both use the same sparse haptic proxy to provide haptic feedback to the user during task completion.},

Use and ownership were ubiquitous, but students demonstrated variability in coping with the inevitable; disconnection was more burdensome for low-resourced students. Findings extend technology maintenance and are leveraged as a starting point for three calls for action in HCI: 1) the CHI community should research the burdens of poverty in poor and wealthy contexts; 2) new HCI projects should accommodate inconsistent access; and, 3) new design choices should minimize disruption and optimize stability. This requires action at the individual and organizational level as designers create products that consider marginalization but also use expertise to influence policy.},

We present an approach that bypasses labeling each behavior instance that a person exhibits. Instead, we weakly label instances using people's demonstrated routine. We classify and generate new instances based on the probability that they belong to the routine model.

Our first experiment revealed that scrolling through a continuous image stream of the navigation path is highly informative, but it becomes tedious with constant use. Discrete image checkpoints require less effort, but can be confusing. A balance may be struck by adding fast video transitions between image checkpoints, but precise control is required to handle difficult situations. Authoring still image checkpoints is also difficult, and this inspired us to invent a new technique using video checkpoints.

Such infrequent measurements hamper the opportunity to detect changes and intervene early in the impairment process. In this paper, we develop a sensor that uses radio signals to continuously measure gait velocity and stride length at home. Our sensor hangs on a wall like a picture frame. It does not require the monitored person to wear or carry a device on her body. Our approach builds on recent advances in wireless systems which have shown that one can locate people based on how their bodies impact the surrounding radio signals. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method by comparing it to the gold standard in clinical tests, and the VICON motion tracking system. Our experience from deploying the sensor in 14 homes indicates comfort with the technology and a high acceptance rate.},

The prevalence of devices carried by students and the emergence of novel peer feedback systems enables the possibility of collecting and sharing feedback immediately between students during class. However, pen and paper is thought to be more familiar, less distracting for students, and easier for instructors to implement and manage. To evaluate the efficacy of in-class digital feedback systems, we conducted a within-subjects study with 73 students during two weeks of a game design course. After short student presentations, while instructors provided verbal feedback, peers provided feedback either on paper or through a device. The study found that both methods yielded comments of similar quality and quantity, but the digital approach provided additional ways for students to participate and required less effort from the instructors. While both methods produced similar behaviors, students held inaccurate perceptions about their behavior with each method. We discuss design implications for technologies to support in-class feedback exchange.},

At 3-year follow-up adrenaline carriage improved further and confidence remained higher. Participants expressed how the education session was a turning point in taking control of their allergy and how the app facilitated sharing about anaphylaxis with others.

Since a brutal gang-rape incident took place in Delhi in December 2012 and received global attention, women's safety has been the focus of much attention India-wide. In April 2016, the Indian government issued a mandate that all mobile phones sold in India 2017 onwards must include a panic button for women's safety. We draw on interview and survey data to examine women's responses to the mandate, also investigating what factors influence their perceptions of safety, positively and negatively. Our findings indicate that women's sense of safety may be deconstructed into a multitude of factors--personal, public, social, technological--that must align for this sense of safety to be preserved. We then discuss the implications these factors have for the success and (re-)design of the panic button and similar interventions.},

Drawing on a corpus of video recordings capturing 'naturally occurring' Kinect gaming within home settings, we detail how the analytic 'work' of spectating is interactionally accomplished as a matter of collaborative action with players and engagement in the game. We examine: spectators supporting players with continuous 'scaffolding'; spectators critiquing player technique during and between moments of play; spectators recognising and complimenting competent player conduct; and spectators reflecting on prior play to build instructions for the player. From this we draw out a number of points that shift the conversation in HCI about 'the spectator' towards understanding and designing for spectating as an interactional activity; that is, sequentially ordered and temporally coordinated. We also discuss bodily conduct and the particular ways of 'seeing' involved in spectating, and conclude with remarks on conceptual and design implications for HCI.},

Food-grade organic molecules anthocyanin, vanillin, and chitosan were employed as dopants to synthesize materials which output a spectrum of colors, degrees of shape deformation, and switch between odorous and non-odorous states. We evaluated the individual output properties of our sensor-actuators to assess the rate, range, and reversibility of the changes as a function of pH 2-10. We present a design space with techniques for enhancing the functionality of the material primitives, and offer passive and computational methods for controlling the material interfaces.

These incidents of user backlash point to larger issues such as inaccurate understandings of how algorithmic systems work as well as mismatches between designer and user intent. Using a content analysis of 102,827 tweets from #RIPTwitter, a recent hashtag-based backlash to rumors about introducing algorithmic curation to Twitter's timeline, this study addresses the nature of user resistance in the form of the complaints being expressed, folk theories of the algorithmic system espoused by users, and how these folk theories potentially frame user reactions. We find that resistance to algorithmic change largely revolves around expectation violation, with folk theories acting as frames for reactions such that more detailed folk theories are expressed through more specific reactions to algorithmic change.},

This means that classifying users' interruptibility as a binary status, interruptible or not interruptible, is not sufficient to accurately measure their availability towards smartphone interruptions. In this paper, we propose, implement and evaluate a two-stage hierarchical model to predict people's interruptibility intensity. Our work is the first to introduce personality traits into interruptibility prediction model, and we found that personality data improves the prediction significantly. Our model bootstraps the prediction with similar people's data, and provides a good initial prediction for users whose individual models have not been trained on their own data yet.

In an evaluation with 27 participants, we show that participants more frequently used the voice-driven system than a comparison text-based system.

Although most participants believed that their behaviors within the app accurately reflected their "true selves," we found that in-app traits generally correlated more strongly with Miitomo engagement patterns than did users' "real life" traits and qualities.

The game was tested with mixed ability and gender groups of students using the Teams-Game-Tournament collaboration technique. A key outcome was that the students with educationally disadvantaged backgrounds benefited from using the game format. They devised their own play and study strategies. We discuss implications on future designs of the game, and considerations for its integration in Egyptian schools.},

Possessing predominantly socially-constructed dimensions of value, cosmetic items are chosen, discussed, assessed, and valuated in an ongoing iterative collaborative process by communities of players. In our study, we explore the case of Dota 2 and apply Topic Modeling to community-discussions data gathered from Reddit.com. We describe social experiences related to the valuation of cosmetic items in interaction and collision of various logics, including artificial scarcity, decomposition of visual effects, and connectedness to the game lore. Our findings connect the collective experience of players in the game and on online community platforms, suggesting that non-utility-based social value construction becomes an important part of game experience.},

As a mode of scientific inquiry, citizen science has the potential to "scale up" scientific data collection efforts and increase lay engagement with science. However, current technological directions risk losing sight of the ways in which citizen science is actually practiced. As citizen science is increasingly used to describe a wide range of activities, we begin by presenting a framework of citizen science genres. We then present findings from four interlocking qualitative studies and technological interventions of community air quality monitoring efforts, examining the motivations and capacities of citizen participants and characterizing their alignment with different types of citizen science. Based on these studies, we suggest that data acquisition involves complex multi-dimensional tradeoffs, and the commonly held view that citizen science systems are a win-win for citizens and science may be overstated.},

To address this research gap, we take a novel approach, examining how such reflections can be stimulated through a medium that generations of families have used for reflection and teaching: storytelling. Through observations and interviews, we studied how 13 families interacted with a low-fidelity prototype, and their attitudes towards this tool. Our prototype used storytelling and interactive prompts to scaffold reflection on factors that impact children's PA.

In contrast, recent research promotes constructive visualization where individual data units and visuals are directly manipulated. We present a qualitative study comparing people's visualization processes using two visualization tools: one promoting a top-down approach to visualization construction (Tableau Desktop) and one implementing a bottom-up constructive visualization approach (iVoLVER). Our results show how the two approaches influence: 1) the visualization process, 2) decisions on the visualization design, 3) the feeling of control and authorship, and 4) the willingness to explore alternative designs. We discuss the complex trade-offs between the two approaches and outline considerations for designing better visualization tools.},

Time is encoded both explicitly and implicitly in designed products. However, many technologies propagate business-centric, modernist values such as scheduling and efficiency, and marginalize broader socio-cultural aspects on which many activities are nonetheless contingent, e.g. the right people, the right weather conditions, and the right vibe. We derive our reflections from a case study of a cross-cultural digital noticeboard designed with an Australian Aboriginal community. Attention to the situational when opens up new possibilities for design that put greater emphasis on the social and relational aspects of time, the situational insights embodied in local narratives, and the tangible (e.g. people) and intangible (e.g. energy) circumstances that together make up the "right" time.},

 abstract = {In this paper we explore the motivations for, and practicalities of, incorporating "implications for adoption" into HCI research practice. Implications for adoption are speculations which may be used in research projects to scrutinize and explore the implications and requirements associated with a technology's potential adoption in the future. There is a rich tradition within the HCI community of implementing, demonstrating, and testing new interactions or technologies by building prototypes. User-centered design methods help us to develop prototypes to and move toward designs that are validated, efficient, and rewarding to use. However, these studies rarely shift their temporal focus to consider, in any significant detail, what it would mean for a technology to exist beyond its prototypical implementation, in other words how these prototypes might ultimately be adopted. Given the CHI community's increasing interest in technology-related human and social effects, the lack of attention paid to adoption represents a significant and relevant gap in current practices. It is this gap that the paper addresses and in doing so offers three contributions: (1) exploring and unpacking different notions of adoption from varying disciplinary perspectives; (2) discussing why considering adoption is relevant and useful, specifically in HCI research; (3) discussing methods for addressing this need, specifically design fiction, and understanding how utilizing these methods may provide researchers with means to better understand the myriad of nuanced, situated, and technologically-mediated relationships that innovative designs facilitate.},

 abstract = {Crowdsourcing provides a scalable and efficient way to construct labeled datasets for training machine learning systems. However, creating comprehensive label guidelines for crowdworkers is often prohibitive even for seemingly simple concepts. Incomplete or ambiguous label guidelines can then result in differing interpretations of concepts and inconsistent labels. Existing approaches for improving label quality, such as worker screening or detection of poor work, are ineffective for this problem and can lead to rejection of honest work and a missed opportunity to capture rich interpretations about data. We introduce Revolt, a collaborative approach that brings ideas from expert annotation workflows to crowd-based labeling. Revolt eliminates the burden of creating detailed label guidelines by harnessing crowd disagreements to identify ambiguous concepts and create rich structures (groups of semantically related items) for post-hoc label decisions. Experiments comparing Revolt to traditional crowdsourced labeling show that Revolt produces high quality labels without requiring label guidelines in turn for an increase in monetary cost. This up front cost, however, is mitigated by Revolt's ability to produce reusable structures that can accommodate a variety of label boundaries without requiring new data to be collected. Further comparisons of Revolt's collaborative and non-collaborative variants show that collaboration reaches higher label accuracy with lower monetary cost.},

At each stage, students received feedback from peers and external crowds: their own social networks, online communities, and a task market. We measured the quality, quantity and valence of the feedback and the actions taken on it, and categorized its content using a taxonomy of critique discourse. The study found that peers produced feedback that was of higher perceived quality, acted upon more, and longer compared to the crowds. However, crowd feedback was found to be a viable supplement to peer feedback and students preferred it for projects targeting specialized audiences. Feedback from all sources spanned only a subset of the critique categories. Instructors may fill this gap by further scaffolding feedback generation.

We interviewed 24 low-wage workers who experienced wage theft and sought justice about their work practices, challenges, and information technology usage. Based on these interviews, we identify three key sociotechnical practices these workers engaged in to address their wage theft: 1) identifying wage and payment discrepancies; 2) tracking and documenting work; and 3) pursuing wage claims. Seeking to leverage HCI research to interrupt uneven social, economic, and information relations in the low-wage workplace, we ultimately reflect on the possibility and limits of several key design recommendations.},

Over the course of two years, we interviewed and conducted design-based fieldwork in two large U.S. cities with individuals and advocacy organizations, learning about the goals, motivations, and constraints that inform their work in their respective urban homes. Our design-based investigation and fieldwork advance a deeper, situated understanding of the role that computing technology plays when engaging across multiple sites of advocacy work. From this, we add detail to the connections across resources, identities, and issues and continue to advance the emerging area of digital civics, which seeks to design tools that support relational civic interactions across multiple categories of civic actors.},

However, how to make these services work better among low-income and transportation-scarce households, how these individuals experience these services, and whether they encounter barriers in enlisting these services is unknown. To address these questions, we onboarded 13 low-income individuals living in transportation-scarce environments to Uber as passengers. Our participants found these services to be reliable and benefited from rich social interactions with drivers; however, barriers such as cost, limited payment methods, and low digital literacy can make such services infeasible. We contribute platform designs that could lead to increased digital literacy and application transparency. To be more inclusive and to reach critical mass, we suggest that these companies foster belief in commons and community trust by coordinating with local businesses in low-resource areas with lower digital literacy.},

Care and Connect saw significant support in its early stages on the online platform, yet failed to engage participants in its design phase and deployment. To unpick this, we contribute an account of its initial use in the community, and then describe findings from research engagements with carers and people with dementia. These workshops used Care and Connect to structure discussions of participants' own experiences of dementia-friendliness, and uncovered themes of 1) trust, 2) exclusion versus inclusion, 3) duration and quality of time, and 4) empathy becoming action. Using this evidence, we advance an account of online community commissioning as a process which needs to understand not only the general issues ongoing in communities facing significant life challenges, but also the particularity of community members' experiences.},

 abstract = {Despite the increasing popularity of head mounted displays (HMDs), development of efficient text entry methods on these devices has remained under explored. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of head-based text entry for HMDs, by which, the user controls a pointer on a virtual keyboard using head rotation. Specifically, we investigate three techniques: TapType, DwellType, and GestureType. Users of TapType select a letter by pointing to it and tapping a button. Users of DwellType select a letter by pointing to it and dwelling over it for a period of time. Users of GestureType perform word-level input using a gesture typing style. Two lab studies were conducted. In the first study, users typed 10.59 WPM, 15.58 WPM, and 19.04 WPM with DwellType, TapType, and GestureType, respectively. Users subjectively felt that all three of the techniques were easy to learn and considered the induced fatigue to be acceptable. In the second study, we further investigated GestureType. We improved its gesture-word recognition algorithm by incorporating the head movement pattern obtained from the first study. This resulted in users reaching 24.73 WPM after 60 minutes of training. Based on these results, we argue that head-based text entry is feasible and practical on HMDs, and deserves more attention.},

ProbUI replaces today's static target models (bounding boxes) with probabilistic gestures ("bounding behaviours"). It is the first touch GUI framework to unite concepts from three areas of related work: 1) Developers declaratively define touch behaviours for GUI targets. As a key insight, the declarations imply simple probabilistic models (HMMs with 2D Gaussian emissions). 2) ProbUI derives these models automatically to evaluate users' touch sequences. 3) It then infers intended behaviour and target. Developers bind callbacks to gesture progress, completion, and other conditions. We show ProbUI's value by implementing existing and novel widgets, and report developer feedback from a survey and a lab study.},

In this paper, we examine effects of movement and mimicry in robot-mediated communication. Participants were instructed to get to know their partner, a confederate, who interacted with them via a telepresence robot. The robot either (a) mimicked the participant's body orientation (mimicry condition), (b) mimicked pre-recorded movements of another participant (random movement condition), or (c) did not move during the interaction (static condition). Results showed that mimicry and random movement had similar effects on participants' perceptions of similarity and closeness to their partners and that these effects depend on the participant's gender and level of self-monitoring. The findings suggest that the social movements of a telepresence robot affect interpersonal processes and that these effects are shaped by individual differences.},

As part of an industry-led research program, we introduced experience-driven design to metal industry companies with experience goals as the key technique. Four design cases in three companies showed that the goals are useful in keeping the focus on user experience, but several challenges are still left for future research to tackle. This exploratory research lays ground for future research by providing initial criteria for assessing experience design tools. The results shed light on utilizing experience goals in industrial design projects and help practitioners in planning and managing the product design process with user experience in mind.},

Typically, these occur whenever professionals are ill-positioned with respect to the display or visualize images under improper light and luminance conditions. In this work, we show that virtual reality can assist radiodiagnostics by considerably diminishing or cancel out the effects of unsuitable ambient conditions. Our approach combines immersive head-mounted displays with interactive surfaces to support professional radiologists in analyzing medical images and formulating diagnostics. We evaluated our prototype with two senior medical doctors and four seasoned radiology fellows.

Individuation expresses how, over time, a technology becomes personal and intimate, unique in purpose, orchestrated in place, and how people eventually come to rely on it to sustain connection with others. We articulate this concept as a critical vantage point for designing augmented everyday objects and the Internet of Things. Individuation foregrounds aspects of habituation, routines and arrangements that through everyday practices reveal unique meaning, reflect self-identity and support agency. The concept is illustrated through three long term case studies of technology in use, involving tangible and embodied interaction with devices that afford communication, monitoring, and awareness in the home setting. The cases are analysed using Hornecker and Buur's Tangible Interaction Framework. We further extend upon this framework to better reveal the role played by personal values, history of use, and arrangements, as they develop over time in the home setting, in shaping tangible and embodied interaction with individuated technologies.},

Our results show that a respondent's position on the leaderboard had important effects on their perception of the leaderboard and the surrounding app, and that participants rated leaderboards most favorably in fitness apps and least favorably in social networking contexts. More extraverted people reported more positive experiences with leaderboards despite their ranking or the application domain. We present design implications for creating leaderboards targeted at different domains and for different audiences.},

MarkPad allows creating a large number of size-dependent gestural shortcuts that can be spatially organized as desired by the user. It relies on the idea of using visual or tactile marks on the touchpad or a combination of them. Gestures start from a mark on the border and end on another mark anywhere. MarkPad does not conflict with standard interactions and provides a novice mode that acts as a rehearsal of the expert mode. A first study showed that an accuracy of 95% could be achieved for a dense configuration of tactile and/or visual marks allowing many gestures. Performance was 5% lower in a second study where the marks were only on the borders. A last study showed that borders are rarely used, even when the users are unaware of the technique. Finally, we present a working prototype and briefly report on how it was used by two users for a few months.},

While researchers have implemented mechanisms to improve the content of feedback, most systems for online feedback exchange do not support an end-to-end cycle, from help-seeking to sense-making to action. Building on extant literature in learning sciences, design, organizational behavior, and online communities, we propose a conceptual framework to highlight critical processes that affect online feedback exchange. We contribute research questions for future feedback systems and argue that online feedback systems must be able to support designers through five activities that happen before, during, and after the feedback exchange. Our framework suggests that systems should address broader socio-psychological factors, such as how intent should be communicated online, how dialogue can support the interpretation of feedback, and how to balance the tradeoffs of anonymizing feedback providers.},

Those defenses, however, may not be sufficient to prevent social insider attacks, where attackers know their victims, and gain access to a victim's account by interacting directly with their device. To characterize these attacks, we ran two MTurk studies. In the first (n = 1,308), using the list experiment method, we estimated that 24% of participants had perpetrated social insider attacks and that 21% had been victims (and knew about it). In the second study (n = 45), participants wrote stories detailing personal experiences with such attacks. Using thematic analysis, we typified attacks around five motivations (fun, curiosity, jealousy, animosity, and utility), and explored dimensions associated with each type. Our combined findings indicate that social insider attacks are common, often have serious emotional consequences, and have no simple mitigation.},

Unfortunately, many who attempt diagnostic self tracking have trouble accomplishing their goals. People often lack knowledge and skills needed to design and conduct scientifically rigorous experiments, and current tools provide little support. To address these shortcomings and explore opportunities for diagnostic self tracking, we designed, developed, and evaluated a mobile app that applies a self experimentation framework to support patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in identifying their personal food triggers. TummyTrials aids a person in designing, executing, and analyzing self experiments to evaluate whether a specific food triggers their symptoms. We examined the feasibility of this approach in a field study with 15 IBS patients, finding that participants could use the tool to reliably undergo a self-experiment. However, we also discovered an underlying tension between scientific validity and the lived experience of self experimentation. We discuss challenges of applying clinical research methods in everyday life, motivating a need for the design of self experimentation systems to balance rigor with the uncertainties of everyday life.},

We developed two technology probes to explore how to embed graphical substrates into tools. Contextify lets designers tailor layouts according to each reader's intention and context; while Linkify lets designers create dynamic layouts based on relationships among content properties. We tested the probes with professional graphic designers, who all identified novel uses in their current projects.

We introduce post-userism, a perspective that simultaneously acknowledges the limits of, and proposes alternatives to, the central construct of the user as proxy for the "human" in HCI. Drawing on developments across the historical trajectory of HCI, we articulate how the user is enacted across four different levels of representation-systems, interface, design process, and the ideology and identify situations where the user breaks down. Synthesizing prior work, we offer a series of strategies for grappling with such situations. In doing so, we seek to overcome the limitations imposed by the user and develop a language that will aid in evolving the foundations of HCI by asking what, exactly, we place at the center of our scholarship and design.},

We first conduct a user study on common postures during smartphone use. We then design an experiment to evaluate the accuracy of ScreenGlint under varying face-to-screen distances. An in-depth evaluation involving multiple users is conducted and the impact of head pose variations is investigated. ScreenGlint achieves an overall angular error of 2.44º without head pose variations, and 2.94º with head pose variations. Our technique compares favorably to state-of-the-art research works, indicating that the glint of the screen is an effective and practical cue to gaze estimation on the smartphone platform. We believe that this work can open up new possibilities for practical and ubiquitous gaze-aware applications.},

Users can customize food shape transformations through a pre-defined simulation platform, and then fabricate these designed patterns using additive manufacturing. Three application techniques are provided - 2D-to-3D folding, hydration-induced wrapping, and temperature-induced self-fragmentation, to present the shape, texture, and interaction with food materials. Based on this concept, several dishes were created in the kitchen, to demonstrate the futuristic dining experience through materials-based interaction design.},

 abstract = {Sleep is an important aspect of our health, but it is difficult for people to track manually because it is an unconscious activity. The ability to sense sleep has aimed to lower the barriers of tracking sleep. Although sleep sensors are widely available, their usefulness and potential to promote healthy sleep behaviors has not been fully realized. To understand people's perspectives on sleep sensing devices and their potential for promoting sleep health, we surveyed 87 and interviewed 12 people who currently use or have previously used sleep sensors, interviewed 5 sleep medical experts, and conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of 6986 reviews of the most popular commercial sleep sensing technologies. We found that the feedback provided by current sleep sensing technologies affects users' perceptions of their sleep and encourages goals that are in tension with evidence-based methods for promoting good sleep health. Our research provides design recommendations for improving the feedback of sleep sensing technologies by bridging the gap between expert and user goals.},

Each modality has been studied individually, but can only convey a limited range of emotions within two-dimensional valence-arousal space. This paper is the first to systematically combine multiple modalities to expand the available affective range. Three studies were conducted: Study 1 measured the emotionality of vibrotactile feedback by itself; Study 2 measured the perceived emotional content of three bimodal combinations: vibrotactile + thermal, vibrotactile + visual and visual + thermal. Study 3 then combined all three modalities. Results show that combining modalities increases the available range of emotional states, particularly in the problematic top-right and bottom-left quadrants of the dimensional model. We also provide a novel lookup resource for designers to identify stimuli to convey a range of emotions},

In their clinical practice, they draw from and adapt guidelines and research-based strategies to fit individual client situations and challenges. Designers of technologies to support quitting smoking can learn from these real world practices to create tools that better adapt to individual differences. We present findings from interviews with 28 providers with diverse experiences in smoking cessation counselling. Through analysis of their individualization strategies, challenges, and perceptions of technology, we find that providers: (1) individualize context appropriate coping strategies by involving clients in brainstorming, (2) emphasize the need to support nicotine withdrawal in clients, (3) mitigate social triggers and mediate social support for clients, and (4) need to navigate dependencies with other providers for managing medications and comorbid health conditions of clients. With this empirical understanding, we extend the discussion on the design of technology to support quitting smoking, highlight current barriers to individualization, and suggest future opportunities to address these barriers.},

The system design is based on novel 3D drawing principles and the subsequent optimization, making the stroke sequence of the wire model drawable and easy to draw. On-the-fly edits on unsatisfactory strokes are also allowed for creative design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by testing on a variety of wire models and a user study.

While web designs have undergone changes for 25 years, we lack theories to describe or explain these changes. In this paper, we take a first step towards identifying and understanding the design periods of websites. Drawing from humanistic HCI methods, we asked subject experts of web design to critically analyze a dataset of prominent websites whose lifetimes span over a decade. These informed judgments reveal a set of key markers that signal shifts in design periods. For instance, advances in display technologies and changes in company strategies help explain how design periods demarcated by particular layout templates and navigation models arise. We suggest that designers and marketers can draw inspiration from website designs curated into design periods. Future work should examine the utility of applying design periods to any computationally embedded artifact that is an interaction design.},

Rather than simply executing user navigation commands, BIGnav interprets user input to update its knowledge about the user's intended target. Then it navigates to a new view that maximizes the information gain provided by the user's expected subsequent input. We conducted a controlled experiment demonstrating that BIGnav is significantly faster than conventional pan and zoom and requires fewer commands for distant targets, especially in non-uniform information spaces. We also applied BIGnav to a realistic application and showed that users can navigate to highly probable points of interest on a map with only a few steps. We then discuss the tradeoffs of BIGnav--including efficiency vs. increased cognitive load--and its application to other interaction tasks.},

A pressure-sensor matrix on a skateboard deck is used to record the pressure distribution data, which are then played using the video function of a smartphone camera. With this logged data, a user can access the feet positions, pressure intensity, and timing of the foot movements. To verify the proposed concept and determine the specific context of its use, an experimental session and interviews were conducted with skateboarders of various skill levels.

But without additional camera technology, an HMD occludes all visual feedback about a user's hand position over the keyboard. We describe a system that assists HMD users in typing on a physical keyboard. Our system has a virtual keyboard assistant that provides visual feedback inside the HMD about a user's actions on the physical keyboard. It also provides powerful automatic correction of typing errors by extending a state-of-the-art touchscreen decoder. In a study with 24 participants, we found our virtual keyboard assistant enabled users to type more accurately on a visually-occluded keyboard.

 abstract = {Research on Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) has shown that the use of multimedia materials such as images and videos can facilitate interpretation and memorization of new words and phrases by providing richer cues than text alone. We present ViVo, a novel video-augmented dictionary that provides an inexpensive, convenient, and scalable way to exploit huge online video resources for vocabulary learning. ViVo automatically generates short video clips from existing movies with the target word highlighted in the subtitles. In particular, we apply a word sense disambiguation algorithm to identify the appropriate movie scenes with adequate contextual information for learning. We analyze the challenges and feasibility of this approach and describe our interaction design. A user study showed that learners were able to retain nearly 30% more new words with ViVo than with a standard bilingual dictionary days after learning. They preferred our video-augmented dictionary for its benefits in memorization and enjoyable learning experience.},

In this note, we explore the construct of pause, its rhythms, and nuances of enacting pause. Throughout, we draw on our experience engaging with pause in the multi-lifespan design of information systems for transitional justice. Five rhythms are identified: periodic hiatus, pending future event, responding to the socio-political climate, (temporary) closure, and laying fallow. In addition, we provide heuristics for managing pause and then restarting the design process. We then explore the scalability of pause from longer (e.g., multi-lifespan design) to shorter timeframes. We conclude with reflections on the potential benefits and open questions about pause as a design mechanism.},

Ultrasound imaging has remained under-explored in the HCI community despite being non-invasive, harmless and capable of imaging internal body parts, with applications including smart-watch interaction, prosthesis control and instrument tuition. In this paper, we compare the performance of different forearm mounting positions for a wearable ultrasonographic device. Location plays a fundamental role in ergonomics and performance since the anatomical features differ among positions. We also investigate the performance decrease due to cross-session position shifts and develop a technique to compensate for this misalignment. Our gesture recognition algorithm combines image processing and neural networks to classify the flexion and extension of 10 discrete hand gestures with an accuracy above 98%. Furthermore, this approach can continuously track individual digit flexion with less than 5% NRMSE, and also differentiate between digit flexion at different joints.},

A distinctive feature of text entry in Korea is that traditionally different manufacturers have developed their own text entry methods starting with particular physical layouts on feature phones that are now available as soft keypads on smartphones. This research considers the next step in this progression by studying the viability of adopting these text entry methods on smartwatches. The results from the user study indicate that existing methods can be effective for text entry on smartwatches; analysis of the data offers suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the methods.},

In this paper, we present mechanisms of bidirectional gaze - the coordinated production and detection of gaze cues - by which a virtual character can coordinate its gaze cues with those of its human user. We implement these mechanisms in a hybrid stochastic/heuristic model synthesized from data collected in human-human interactions. In three lab studies wherein a virtual character instructs participants in a sandwich-making task, we demonstrate how bidirectional gaze can lead to positive outcomes in error rate, completion time, and the agent's ability to produce quick, effective nonverbal references. The first study involved an on-screen agent and the participant wearing eye-tracking glasses. The second study demonstrates that these positive outcomes can be achieved using head-pose estimation in place of full eye tracking. The third study demonstrates that these effects also transfer into virtual-reality interactions.},

Designers often need to embed custom circuitry; program its workings; and create a form factor that not only reflects the desired user experience but can also house the required circuitry and electronics. To mitigate this, we created Pineal, a design tool that lets end-users: (1) modify 3D models to include a smart watch or phone as its heart; (2) specify high-level interactive behaviours through visual programming; and (3) have the phone or watch act out such behaviours as the objects' "smarts". Furthermore, a series of prototypes show how Pineal exploits mobile sensing and output, and automatically generates 3D printed form-factors for rich, interactive, objects.},

This has the potential to increase driver distraction and error as controls may be harder to find and use. This paper presents an in-car, on the road driving study which examined three key types of input controls to investigate their effects: a physical dial, pressure-based input on a touch surface and touch input on a touchscreen. The physical dial and pressure-based input were also evaluated with and without haptic feedback. The study was conducted with users performing a list-based targeting task using the different controls while driving on public roads. Eye-gaze was recorded to measure distraction from the primary task of driving. The results showed that target accuracy was high across all input methods (greater than 94%). Pressure-based targeting was the slowest while directly tapping on the targets was the faster selection method. Pressure-based input also caused the largest number of glances towards to the touchscreen but the duration of each glance was shorter than directly touching the screen. Our study will enable designers to make more appropriate design choices for future in-car interactions.},

Instead, we investigate the use of compression feedback for notifications, which scales from subtle stimuli to strong ones and can provide sustained stimuli over longer periods. Compression feedback utilizes inflatable straps around a user's limbs, a form factor allowing for easy integration into many common wearables. We explore technical aspects of compression feedback and investigate its psychophysical properties with several lab and in situ studies. Furthermore, we show how compression feedback enables reactive feedback. Here, deflation patterns are used to reveal further information on a user's query. We also compare compression and vibrotactile feedback and find that they have similar performance.},

Users appropriate the features and technical constraints of their apps to create idiosyncratic communication places, each with its own recursively defined membership rules, perceived purposes, and emotional connotations. Users also shift the boundaries of their communication places to accommodate changes in their contacts' behaviour, the dynamics of their relationships, and the restrictions of the technology.

We discuss how value-sensitive actions and activities, including engagements with those with lived experiences of self-harm, were used to scaffold the conventional hackathon format in such a challenging context. Our approach was then extended through a series of critical engagements with clinicians and charity workers who provided appraisal of the prototypes and designs. Through analysis of these engagements we expose a number of design challenges for future HCI work that considers self-harm; moreover we offer insight into the role of stakeholder critiques in extending and rethinking hackathons as a design method in sensitive contexts.},

The results of this long-term study show that the usage of wearable activity trackers during exercise, even when gamified for increased entertainment, sees a consistent decline over time. This decline, however, is observed to be reversible with periodic updates to the game. This work, we believe, can make a significant contribution to solving the user retention problem of wearable-based exergames.},

 abstract = {This paper reports on two years of ethnographic observation of the science and politics of flood risk in Colorado, as well as design research that examines citizen interaction with expert knowledge about flooding in the region. We argue that the 100-year floodplain standard that inform maps produced by the USA Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s National Floodplain Insurance Program (NFIP) represent a problematic form of discursive closure of scientific understanding of flood hazard. We show that in order to meet the requirements of the NFIP, this standard acts as a closure that conveys a certainty that the underlying science does not warrant and foreshortens dialogue on disaster risk and public understanding of flood hazard. Engaging with literature in science and technology studies and human-centered computing, we investigate design opportunities for resisting closure and supporting public formation through encounters with the uncertainty and complexities of risk information.},

As many charts do not explicitly include trend lines or related statistical summaries, viewers often visually estimate trends directly from a plot. How reliable are the inferences viewers draw when performing such regression by eye? Do particular visualization designs or data features bias trend perception? We present a series of crowdsourced experiments that assess the accuracy of trends estimated using regression by eye across a variety of bivariate visualizations, and examine potential sources of bias in these estimations. We find that viewers accurately estimate trends in many standard visualizations of bivariate data, but that both visual features (e.g., "within-the-bar" bias) and data features (e.g., the presence of outliers) can result in visual estimates that systematically diverge from standard least-squares regression models.},

We propose and evaluate a novel design point around a tilt-based text entry technique which supports single handed usage. Our technique is based on the gesture keyboard (shape writing). However, instead of drawing gestures with a finger or stylus, users articulate a gesture by tilting the device. This can be especially useful when the user's other hand is otherwise encumbered or unavailable. We show that novice users achieve an entry rate of 15 words-per-minute (wpm) after minimal practice. A pilot longitudinal study reveals that a single participant achieved an entry rate of 32 wpm after approximate 90 minutes of practice. Our data indicate that tilt-based gesture keyboard entry enables walk-up use and provides a suitable text entry rate for occasional use and can act as a promising alternative to single-handed typing in certain situations.},

Recently, ToneWars, a collaborative mobile learning game, demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of connecting CSL learners with native speakers for tone learning. However, the synchronous gameplay nature in ToneWars can be hard to scale due to the time constraint and limited availability of native speakers. We present principled research to make ToneWars scalable and sustainable. First, we address the scalability issue via asynchronous modeling of native speakers. Second, we quantify whether a CSL learner achieves native level mastery for a specific phrase, and explore the use of fine-grained feedback on language mastery as a sustainable motivator for language learning. The insights in this research are generalizable to designing second language learning technologies beyond Chinese. In a longitudinal study with 18 CSL learners, we found that asynchronous gameplay significantly improved learning with an average gain of 29.7 tones and 16.4 syllables, and helped participants achieve native level mastery on 58.2 out of 69 phrases.},

We interviewed 18 members of two Mom-to-Mom Facebook sale groups. Despite a lack of commerce tools, members perceived sale groups as an easy-to-use way to quickly and conveniently buy and sell. Most important to members was that the groups felt safe and trustworthy. Drawing on these insights, we contribute a novel framing, community commerce, which explains the trust mechanisms that enable transactions between strangers in some groups. Community commerce fosters trust through (a) exclusive membership to a closed group, (b) regulation and sanctioning of behavior at the admin, member, and group level, and (c) a shared group identity or perceived similarity (though, surprisingly, not through social bonding). We discuss how community commerce affords unique and sometimes superior trust assurances and propose design implications for platforms hoping to foster trust between members who buy, sell, or share amongst themselves.},

 abstract = {Haptic interfaces are ideal in situations where visual/auditory attention is impossible, unsafe, or socially unacceptable. However, conventional (vibrotactile) wearable interfaces often possess a limited bandwidth for expressing information. We explore a novel form of tactile stimulation through brushing, and demonstrate BrushTouch, a wearable prototype for brushing haptics. We also present schemes for conveying information such as time and direction through multi-tactor wrist-worn haptic interfaces. To evaluate BrushTouch, two user studies were run, comparing it to a conventional vibrotactile wristband across a number of tasks in both lab and mobile conditions. We show that for certain cues brushing can be more accurately recognized than vibration, enabling more effective spatial schemes for presenting information through haptic means. We then show that BrushTouch is capable of greater information transfer using such cues. We believe that brushing, as with other non-vibrotactile haptic techniques, merits further investigation as potential vehicles for richer haptic feedback.},

Forty five participants completed a story stem about a male character who was about to have his "very first virtual reality porn experience". Through our analysis, we demonstrate a narrative of a "perfect", idealised sexual experience, as well as one which emphasised the imagined "precarious" and dangerous consequences around this technology use.

To investigate the patient experience in the hospital environment where information is lacking and in accessible, we conducted an ethnographic study with patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers in the emergency care setting. We report the three types of information breakdowns ED patients encountered during their emergency visits and the strategies they developed to cope. Our findings reveal a rich picture of the coping mechanisms ED patients use to proactively adapt to the nature of the ED care context. This work expands upon our understanding of the unique information challenges ED patients face, as well as the important adapting behaviors they engage in; it also uncovers design opportunities for supporting crucial, yet unmet, patient information needs.},

Indeed, by optimizing over search duration, the aid improves efficiency, while preserving decision accuracy, as the operator identifies and classifies targets within simulated aerial imagery. Specifically, using experimental eye-tracking data and measurements about target detectability across the human visual field, we develop functional models of detection accuracy as a function of search time, number of eye movements, scan path, and image clutter. These models are then used by the AAAD in conjunction with real time eye position data to make probabilistic estimations of attained search accuracy and to recommend that the observer either move on to the next image or continue exploring the present image. An experimental evaluation in a scenario motivated from human supervisory control in surveillance missions confirms the benefits of the AAAD.},

 abstract = {HCI is increasingly exploring how temperature can be used as an interaction modality. One challenge is that temperature changes are perceived over the course of seconds. This can be attributed to both the slow response time of skin thermoreceptors and the latency of the technology used to heat and cool the skin. For this reason, thermal cues are typically used to communicate single states, such as an emotion, and then there is a pause of tens of seconds to allow the skin to re-adapt to a neutral temperature before sending another signal. In contrast, this paper presents the first experimental demonstration that continuous temperature changes can guide behaviour: significantly improving performance in a 2D maze navigation task, without having to return to a neutral state before a new signal is sent. We discuss how continuous thermal feedback may be used for real world navigational tasks.},

Finger identification is a promising technique to address this problem by associating different functions with different fingers. However, current technologies for finger identification are unavailable or unsuitable for smartwatches. To address this problem, this paper observes that normal smartwatch use takes places with a relatively static pose between the two hands. In this situation, we argue that the touch and angle profiles generated by different fingers on a standard smartwatch touch screen will differ sufficiently to support reliable identification. The viability of this idea is explored in two studies that capture touches in natural and exaggerated poses during tapping and swiping tasks. Machine learning models report accuracies of up to 93% and 98% respectively, figures that are sufficient for many common interaction tasks. Furthermore, the exaggerated poses show modest costs (in terms of time/errors) compared to the natural touches. We conclude by presenting examples and discussing how interaction designs using finger identification can be adapted to the smartwatch form factor.},

Information theory offers a useful distinction between transmission errors (the received symbol is wrong) and erasures (the received symbol is empty). Although Fitts' law research has been very much inspired by the information theoretic rationale, the error/erasure distinction has escaped attention so far: Target misses have always been treated as normally-distributed errors, through the effective index of difficulty IDe. The paper introduces a new index of difficulty based on the simple observation that a target miss conveys zero bit of information, i.e., it is an erasure. Not only is the new index more consistent with the fundamentals of information theory, it is much simpler to derive than the ISO-recommended IDe.},

This sensation, called the Uncanny Valley effect, is widely acknowledged both in the popular media and scientific research but empirical evidence for the hypothesis has remained inconsistent. In this paper, we investigate the neural responses to computer-generated faces in a cognitive neuroscience study. We record brain activity from participants (N = 40)} using electroencephalography (EEG) while they watch videos of real humans and computer-generated virtual characters. Our results show distinct differences in neural responses for highly realistic computer-generated faces such as Digital Emily compared with real humans. These differences are unique only to agents that are highly photorealistic, i.e. the `uncanny' response. Based on these specific neural correlates we train a support vector machine~(SVM) to measure the probability of an uncanny response for any given computer-generated character from EEG data. This allows the ordering of animated characters based on their level of `uncanniness'.},

Instead of using pointing, speech, or a remote control, the users' arm is extended in augmented reality, allowing access to devices that are out of reach. Thus, we allow users to directly manipulate real-world objects from a distance using their bare hands. A core difficulty we focus on is how to maintain ownership for the unnaturally long virtual arm, which is the strong feeling that one's limbs are actually part of the own body. Fortunately, what the human brain experiences as being part of the own body is very malleable and we find that during interaction the user's virtual arm can be stretched to more than twice its real length, without breaking the user's sense of ownership for the virtual limb.},

This research tests the choice overload effect in an e-commerce context and explores how the choice overload effect is influenced by an individual's tendency to maximize or satisfice decisions. We conducted an online experiment with 611 participants randomly assigned to select a gourmet chocolate bar from either 12, 24, 40, 50, 60, or 72 different options. Consistent with prior work, we find that maximizers are less satisfied with their product choice than satisficers. However, using Bayesian analysis, we find that it's unlikely that choice set size affects choice satisfaction by much, if at all. We discuss why the decision-making process may be different in e-commerce contexts than the physical settings used in previous choice overload experiments.},

During the upgrade process, waiting times were too long, feedback was confusing or misleading, and few had clear mental models of what was happening.

In this paper, we report on a qualitative study on public Wi-Fi conceptions as held by urban Indians, textit{a priori} to connecting to a network. Our findings show that prior public Wi-Fi users and non-users alike raised a surprising range and depth of conceptions---ranging from suspicion of operators' intentions to monetize, to concerns about sexual image morphing, to fears of phone wipeouts, to aspiration---which were informed by popular media, BlueTooth cultures, and social learning. We found these conceptions of Wi-Fi networks to significantly influence adoption of public Wi-Fi. With enormous investments in public Wi-Fi initiatives, we call for network providers to address these deep conceptions among emerging users; by suggesting ways to build public awareness, better user experiences, and business model innovation.},

 abstract = {A myoelectric prosthesis (myo) is a dexterous artificial limb controlled by muscle contractions. Learning to use a myo can be challenging, so extensive training is often required to use a myo prosthesis effectively. Signal visualizations and simple muscle-controlled games are currently used to help patients train their muscles, but are boring and frustrating. Furthermore, current training systems require expensive medical equipment and clinician oversight, restricting training to infrequent clinical visits. To address these limitations, we developed a new game that promotes fun and success, and shows the viability of a low-cost myoelectric input device. We adapted a user-centered design (UCD) process to receive feedback from patients, clinicians, and family members as we iteratively addressed challenges to improve our game. Through this work, we introduce a free and open myo training game, provide new information about the design of myo training games, and reflect on an adapted UCD process for the practical iterative development of therapeutic games.},

However, this study explores an alternative theory of social performance by analyzing a competitive game, Super Smash Bros. Melee, where players face off in timed matches and interact through pre-designed characters. This study shows how Melee players treat virtual characters as performative instruments, similar to the violin or the piano. In forum posts and player-created media, Melee players emphasize the need to train one's hands, eyes, and mind in order to master a character's complexity and express style and skills in live matches. Instrumental embodiment in a competitive game like Melee thus positions players as virtuosos who perform for perceptive audiences. This research points to a range of ways that players may relate to virtual bodies, connected to distinct kinds of social activities.},

We developed a system that captures full-body movement and generates estimated past and future body movement by deformation. With a head mounted display, people could see their bodies as slightly deformed. We then investigated 1) how human movement is physically changed, and 2) how humans feel about the change in physical and emotional views of the body due to virtual body deformation. Our results show that spatial-temporal deformation of a virtual body actually changes the sense of body as well as physical movement. For instance, a body image generated at approximately 25-100 ms in the future induced a "lighter weight" sensation. On the basis of our findings, we discuss the design implication of computational control for the physical and emotional sense of body.},

To evaluate the PinPad scenarios, we implemented demo applications, and conducted interviews with users to collect feedback about their experiences with PinPad and the PinPad scenarios.

 abstract = {We present cascading dwell gaze typing, a novel approach to dwell-based eye typing that dynamically adjusts the dwell time of keys in an on-screen keyboard based on the likelihood that a key will be selected next, and the location of the key on the keyboard. Our approach makes unlikely keys more difficult to select and likely keys easier to select by increasing and decreasing their required dwell times, respectively. To maintain a smooth typing rhythm for the user, we cascade the dwell time of likely keys, slowly decreasing the minimum allowable dwell time as a user enters text. Cascading the dwell time affords users the benefits of faster dwell times while causing little disruption to users' typing cadence. Results from a longitudinal study with 17 non-disabled participants show that our dynamic cascading dwell technique was significantly faster than a static dwell approach. Participants were able to achieve typing speeds of 12.39 WPM on average with our cascading technique, whereas participants were able to achieve typing speeds of 10.62 WPM on average with a static dwell time approach. In a small evaluation conducted with five people with ALS, participants achieved average typing speeds of 9.51 WPM with our cascading dwell approach. These results show that our dynamic cascading dwell technique has the potential to improve gaze typing for users with and without disabilities.},

On the basis of prior literature, we created a new framework that examines the complementary roles between children and adults. Next, we analyzed a case study of a year-long intergenerational design team of children (ages 7-11) and adults. From this analysis, we determined that design partnerships are composed of four dimensions that span from unbalanced to balanced interactions: facilitation, relationship building, design-by-doing, and elaborating together. Finally, to demonstrate its utility, we analyzed two focal co-design sessions using our framework. Our analysis suggests that equal partnership in PD is not a single static interaction but a development over time of design interactions influenced by context, experience, and participants.},

However, mobile devices, the most popular form of online access today, may be more problematic due to variability in the user's posture and in movement of the device. To assess this possibility, we conducted two experiments with 30 lab-based and 303 crowdsourced participants using basic mouse and touchscreen tasks. Our findings show that: (1) separately analyzing the crowd and lab data yields different study conclusions-touchscreen input was significantly less error prone than mouse input in the lab but more error prone online; (2) age-matched crowdsourced participants were significantly faster and less accurate than their lab-based counterparts, contrasting past work; (3) variability in mobile device movement and orientation increased as experimenter control decreased--a potential factor affecting the touchscreen error differences. This study cautions against assuming that crowdsourced data for performance experiments will directly reflect lab-based data, particularly for mobile devices.},

These tactile elements can be used for physical touch input and output, and can reposition according to the application both around the edge of and hidden within the device.

 abstract = {Physiotherapists are increasingly using video conferencing tools for their teleconsultations. Yet, the assessment of subtle differences in body movements remains a challenge. To support lower limb assessment in video consultations, we present SoPhy, a wearable technology consisting of a pair of socks with embedded sensors for patients to wear; and a web interface that displays information about range of weight distribution, foot movement, and foot orientation for physiotherapists in real-time. We conducted a laboratory study of 40 video consultations, in which postgraduate physiotherapy students assessed lower limb function. We compare assessment with and without SoPhy. Findings show that SoPhy increased the confidence in assessing squats exercise and fewer repetitions were required to assess patients when using SoPhy. We discuss the significance of SoPhy to address the challenges of assessing bodily information over video, and present considerations for its integration with clinical practices and tools.},

We analyse log and interview data of 42 community health workers (who were first time smartphone users) from a longitudinal 17-month deployment to better understand how the utility of mobile videos played out over time in rural Lesotho. During the study period, videos were viewed at an average of 170 times per month, for a total of 2898 views. Through this data we draw these primary findings: a) pausing is not contextually necessary, b) age is not a barrier to usage, c) the primary predictor of popularity of a given video is topical relevance and national campaigns, d) there is no apparent relationship between video length, popularity and completion rates, and e) new videos have only a short-lived novelty effect. Furthermore, we affirm that regular engagement with CHWs has an impact on continued usage, in addition to being important for reducing attrition due to technical issues.},

The results show that users significantly changed their behavior, and that this strategy change can be predicted beforehand. A simple model summing the two indexes of difficulty (IDs) for each path predicts movement time well, but more sophisticated models were also evaluated. The best model in terms of both of R2 and AIC values includes the ID of the crossing operation to enter the second path.},

Yet few people know the total cost of owning and operating their vehicles, and most cannot estimate accurately how much a common driving trip (like a daily commute) costs. There are an increasing number of viable alternatives for personal transportation, such as car services (e.g. Uber, Lyft), in addition to ridesharing, transit, biking, and walking. Cost is one factor in transportation mode choice, and awareness of the cost of driving is useful in making better informed decisions. To bridge this awareness gap, we built and deployed a system that makes the total cost of each driving trip (including depreciation, maintenance, insurance, and fuel) visible to the user. After this intervention, participants were able to more accurately and confidently estimate costs of their driving commutes, and transfer this knowledge to other trips for which they had not seen a cost.},

From the sociocultural perspective, on the other hand, media and technology negatively impact body satisfaction and contribute to eating disorders; however, these studies fail to include weight loss apps. While these apps can be beneficial to users, they can also have negative effects on users with eating disorder behaviors. Yet few research studies have looked at weight loss apps in relation to eating disorders. In order to fill this gap, we conducted interviews with 16 women with a history of eating disorders who use(d) weight loss apps. While our findings suggest these apps can contribute to and exacerbate eating disorder behaviors, they also reveal a more complex picture of app usage. Women's use and perceptions of weight loss apps shift as they experience life and move to and from stages of change. This research troubles the binary view of technology and emphasizes the importance of looking at technology use as a dynamic process. Our study contributes to our understanding of weight loss app design.},

They offer a direct interaction that is isomorphic to the manipulation of physical objects. This illusion depends on the ability to provide a natural visuomotor coupling. High performances systems are thus required to evaluate the fundamental merits of HPCDs. We built a spherical HPCD using external projection. The system offers a lightweight wireless seamless display with head-coupled stereo, robust tracking, and low latency. We compared users' performances with this HPCD and two other interactions that used a fixed planar display and either a touchpad or the spherical display as an indirect input. The task involved the inspection of complex virtual 3D puzzles. Physical puzzles were also tested as references. Contrary to expectations, all virtual interactions were found to be more efficient than a more "natural" physical puzzle. The HPCD yielded lower performances than the touchpad. This study indicates that the object examination task did not benefit from the accurate and precise rotations offered by the HPCD, but benefited from the high C/D gain of the touchpad.},

In other words, digital financial platforms are proving capable of supporting new relations between groups of people as well as offering new ways to organize money. Taking an HCI lens, we look at how some crowdfunding platform owners are approaching social innovation, not only at the level of supporting individual community initiatives, but at the broader level of using their platform to change societal behavior. Through four case studies, we show how crowdfunding has been chosen as a tool to redesign society by promoting environmental or social sustainability. We argue that the groups constituted through these interactions are not merely "crowds", but deliberate constellations built round a thing of interest (or "paying publics"). Our interviews with managers and owners explore how interactions with and around platforms work to achieve these ends and we conclude with design considerations.},

This assertion has been verified with several BCI paradigms (e.g. P300). But the cognitive demand of the promising SSVEP paradigm had never been specifically assessed yet. We measured the accuracy of an SSVEP-based BCI used by 26 participants in various conditions of mental workload. Our analysis revealed that surprisingly, for this type of BCI, little attention is actually needed from participants to reach optimal accuracy: participants were able to successfully perform a complex secondary task (N-back) without degrading the BCI accuracy. The same observation was made whether visual or auditive attention was solicited. These results indicate that SSVEP is a low-demanding paradigm in terms of cognitive resources, and are encouraging for its use in complex interaction settings.},

We find that women track their menstrual cycle for varied reasons that include remembering and predicting their period as well as informing conversations with healthcare providers. Participants described six methods of tracking their menstrual cycles, including use of technology, awareness of their premenstrual physiological states, and simply remembering. Although women find apps and calendars helpful, these methods are ineffective when predictions of future menstrual cycles are inaccurate. Designs can create feelings of exclusion for gender and sexual minorities. Existing apps also generally fail to consider life stages that women experience, including young adulthood, pregnancy, and menopause.

The research team adapted participatory design techniques to work with five such women, and their families, to design and evaluate new assistive technology for these women. The process suggests a class of media-playing devices that would be generally useful to women with Rett syndrome: systems that can load multiple audio or video segments; be activated by many different switches; and respond instantly to switch-hits. As well, the systems should permit a caregiver to set the start and end time of each segment, and how the system advances through a sequence of segments. The paper also discusses patterns that were observed when collaborating with the families. For example, parents shared longstanding but untried ideas for new assistive technology; and expressed a strong interest in any device that would help their daughters do things for themselves.},

Activity also influences watch use with significantly longer use while eating than when socialising or performing domestic tasks. One surprising finding is that length of use is similar at home and work. We note that usage peaks around lunchtime, with an average of 5.3 watch uses per hour throughout a day. We supplement these findings with qualitative analysis of the videos, focusing on how use is modified by the presence of others, and the lack of impact of watch glances on conversation.

Participants preferred the less effortful gestures in two of the three easy-difficult gesture pairs when they perceived the difference in effort to be significantly different. The second experiment explores two separate three-dimensional pointing and selection conditions that differ only in the movement distance required to finish the task. In both experiments, there is a significant negative correlation between a gesture's effort and its appeal. The results show the great impact that effort has on a user's willingness to utilize the system.

 abstract = {When human partners attend to peripheral computing devices while interacting with conversational robots, the inability of the robots to determine the actual engagement level of the human partners after gaze shift may cause communication breakdown. In this paper, we propose a real-time perception model for robots to estimate human partners' engagement dynamics, and investigate different robot behavior strategies to handle ambiguities in humans' status and ensure the flow of the conversation. In particular, we define four novel types of engagement status and propose a real-time engagement inference model that weighs humans' social signals dynamically according to the involvement of the computing devices. We further design two robot behavior strategies (explicit and implicit) to help resolve uncertainties in engagement inference and mitigate the impact of uncoupling, based on an annotated human-human interaction video corpus. We conducted a within-subject experiment to assess the efficacy and usefulness of the proposed engagement inference model and behavior strategies. Results show that robots with our engagement model can deliver better service and smoother conversations as an assistant, and people find the implicit strategy more polite and appropriate.},

 abstract = {Navigating mobile virtual reality (VR) is a challenge due to limited input options and/or a requirement for handsfree interaction. Walking-in-place (WIP) is considered to offer a higher presence than controller input but only allows unidirectional navigation in the direction of the user's gaze--which impedes navigation efficiency. Leaning input enables omnidirectional navigation but currently relies on bulky controllers, which aren't feasible in mobile VR contexts. This note evaluates the use of head-tilt - implemented using inertial sensing - to allow for handsfree omnidirectional VR navigation on mobile VR platforms. A user study with 24 subjects compared three input methods using an obstacle avoidance navigation task: (1) head-tilt alone (TILT) (2) a hybrid method (WIP-TILT) that uses head tilting for direction and WIP to control speed; and (3) traditional controller input. TILT was significantly faster than WIP-TILT and joystick input, while WIP-TILT and TILT offered the highest presence. There was no difference in cybersickness between input methods.},

We tested three transition time conditions, with an unstructured transition of control occurring 2s, 5s, or 8s before entering a curve. As participants were occupied with an active secondary task (playing a game on a tablet) while the automated driving mode was enabled, they needed to disengage from the task and regain control of the car when the transition occurred. Few drivers in the 2 second condition were able to safely negotiate the road hazard situation, while the majority of drivers in the 5 or 8 second conditions were able to navigate the hazard situation safely.},

However, existing systems do not yet account for the fact that a visual question can lead to a single answer or multiple different answers. While a crowd often agrees, disagreements do arise for many reasons including that visual questions are ambiguous, subjective, or difficult. We propose a model, CrowdVerge, for automatically predicting from a visual question whether a crowd would agree on one answer. We then propose how to exploit these predictions in a novel application to efficiently collect all valid answers to visual questions. Specifically, we solicit fewer human responses when answer agreement is expected and more human responses otherwise. Experiments on 121,811 visual questions asked by sighted and blind people show that, compared to existing crowdsourcing systems, our system captures the same answer diversity with typically 14-23% less crowd involvement.},

Gesture authentication relies on recognition, wherein raw data is collected from user input and preprocessed into a more manageable form before applying recognition algorithms. Preprocessing is done to improve recognition accuracy, but little work has been done in justifying its effects on authentication. We examined the effects of three variables: location, rotation, and scale, on authentication accuracy. We found that an authentication-optimal combination (location invariant, scale variant, and rotation variant) can reduce the error rate by 45.3% on average compared to the recognition-optimal combination (all invariant). We analyzed 13 gesture recognizers and evaluated them with three criteria: authentication accuracy, and resistance against both brute-force and imitation attacks. Our novel multi-expert method (Garda) achieved the lowest error rate (0.015) in authentication accuracy, the lowest error rate (0.040) under imitation attacks, and resisted all brute-force attacks.},

We compare the gender distribution in photos retrieved by Bing for the query "person" and for queries based on 68 character traits (e.g., "intelligent person") in four regional markets. Photos of men are more often retrieved for "person," as compared to women. As predicted, photos of women are more often retrieved for warm traits (e.g., "emotional") whereas agentic traits (e.g., "rational") are represented by photos of men. A backlash effect, where stereotype-incongruent individuals are penalized, is observed. However, backlash is more prevalent for "competent women" than "warm men."

Spatial learning in the real world benefits greatly from landmarks in the environment, but user interfaces often provide very few visual landmarks. In this paper we explore the use of artificial landmarks as a way to improve people's spatial memory in spatially-stable grid menus called CommandMaps. We carried out three studies to test the effects of three types of artificial landmarks (standard grid, simple anchor marks, and a transparent image) on spatial learning. We found that for small grid menus, the artificial landmarks had little impact on performance, whereas for medium and large grids, the simple anchor marks significantly improved performance. The simple visual anchors were faster and less error-prone than the visually richer transparent image. Our studies show that artificial landmarks can be a valuable addition to spatial interfaces.},

The interface also allows users to input which of such cues are relevant to events of their interests. Through our user study, we confirm that users can find events of interests quickly from first-person videos thanks to the following benefits of using the EgoScanning interface: 1) adaptive changes of playback speeds allow users to watch fast-forwarded videos more easily; 2) Emphasized parts of videos can act as candidates of events actually significant to users; 3) Users are able to select relevant egocentric cues depending on events of their interests.},

We establish an empirical base for the prevalence, context and severity of privacy conflicts over co-owned photos. To this aim, a parallel survey of pre-screened 496 uploaders and 537 co-owners collected occurrences and type of conflicts over co-owned photos, and any actions taken towards resolving them. We uncover nuances and complexities not known before, including co-ownership types, and divergences in the assessment of photo audiences. We also find that an all-or-nothing approach seems to dominate conflict resolution, even when parties actually interact and talk about the conflict.

 abstract = {CHI 2016 is the premier world-wide conference for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and this year took place in the heart of Silicon Valley, San Jose, California. The Proceedings and Extended Abstracts represent today's most innovative, novel and creative work in HCI. These Proceedings and Abstracts have added over one-thousand documents in the ACM Digital Library. Across all tracks, CHI received nearly 5000 submissions and accepted over 1000 that can be seen today. These include almost 600 rigorously reviewed papers and notes selected from over 2200 submissions. These Proceedings and Abstracts also document two days of workshops, symposia and meetings involving over 800 participants, a record number for CHI conferences. The CHI 2016 conference includes two days of focused workshops and four days of technical content, including CHI's prestigious technical program, with 16 parallel sessions of rigorously reviewed research Papers, engaging Panels, Case Studies and Special Interest Groups (SIGs), Conference highlights also include student research, design, and game competitions, and last-minute SIGs for discussing current topics. The popular alt.chi forum enters its eleventh year of provocation within the HCI community. The conference also showcases Interactivity and Interactivity Research Demos, which are hands-on demonstrations of the best in technology and innovation. And we're particularly proud this year to include documents from our new Art Exhibition, held at the Works/San Jose Gallery in conjunction with the CHI conference. We began our conference planning process with three core ideas: "CHI in Silicon Valley": emphasizing local engagement in this vibrant community, "#chiforgood": HCI in the community, both during the workshop time and at appropriate points during the conference, and a "More Humane Conference and Planning Process": lots of transparency, early planning, no surprises, data-driven decisions and taking into account the importance of families, work/life balance, and the like. From this, the overall theme of the conference emerged, #chi4good: addressing issues of social good through the innovation and creativity of the CHI community. To this end we held a Day of Service on the Saturday before the conference with hundreds of CHI attendees working on projects for non-profit and area arts organizations, and we have continued that theme throughout the conference by hosting the Diversity and Inclusion Lunch, brought childcare back to the conference for the first time in many years, and introduced the lunch@chi program to facilitate small group lunches on the first day of the conference. We've introduced CHI's first Diversity & Inclusion Statement, and our keynote speakers, represent the vibrancy, diversity and excitement of the wide field of HCI with particular emphasis on #chi4good. This year's speakers were chosen from among crowd-sourced suggestions from the CHI community and they are: Dayo Olopade, (Journalist and author of The Bright Continent); Kimberly Bryant (Founder, Black Girls Code), in conversation with Sarah Guthals, (Co-Founder of ThoughtSTEM); Marissa Meyer (President & CEO of Yahoo), in conversation with Terry Winograd (Professor Emeritus, Stanford University); Vishal Sikka (CEO of Infosys), in conversation with computing pioneer Alan Kay (Viewpoints Research Institute); and Salman Khan (founder, Khan Academy). With careful consultation from the community, we have enhanced the CHI conference experience from submission and review processes, to more participation possibilities at the conference. Peer-reviewed papers have more space for references and will receive a wider range of better-matched reviews. There are more curated venues and more input into the selection of keynote speakers.},

 abstract = {For eye tracking to become a ubiquitous part of our everyday interaction with computers, we first need to understand its limitations outside rigorously controlled labs, and develop robust applications that can be used by a broad range of users and in various environments. Toward this end, we collected eye tracking data from 80 people in a calibration-style task, using two different trackers in two lighting conditions. We found that accuracy and precision can vary between users and targets more than six-fold, and report on differences between lighting, trackers, and screen regions. We show how such data can be used to determine appropriate target sizes and to optimize the parameters of commonly used filters. We conclude with design recommendations and examples how our findings and methodology can inform the design of error-aware adaptive applications.},

 abstract = {Textiles are an old and well developed technology that have many desirable characteristics. They can be easily folded, twisted, deformed, or cut; some can be stretched; many are soft. Textiles can maintain their shape when placed under tension and can even be engineered with variable stretching ability. Conversely, 3D printing is a relatively new technology that can precisely produce functional, rigid objects with custom geometry. Combining 3D printing and textiles opens up new opportunities for rapidly creating rigid objects with embedded flexibility as well as soft materials imbued with additional functionality. In this paper, we introduce a suite of techniques for integrating 3D printing with textiles during the printing process, opening up a new design space that takes inspiration from both fields. We demonstrate how the malleability, stretchability and aesthetic qualities of textiles can enhance rigid printed objects, and how textiles can be augmented with functional properties enabled by 3D printing.},

Given the prevalence of smartphones, mindfulness-based mobile applications (MBMAs) have received much attention. Current MBMAs mainly use the guided meditation method which may not be always effective, e.g., users may not be able to follow the pace of instructions and they need a private environment. This paper presents a framework for interactive MBMAs which allows users to self-regulate their attention according to their abilities and conditions. The framework is described by an Attention-Regulation Process and has two components: (1) Relaxation Response and (2) Attention Restoration Theory. The framework is validated by our experiment. It also informs future development for interactive meditation and has broad implications for designing mindfulness and well-being.},

 abstract = {"Remind me to get milk later this afternoon." In communications and planning, people often express uncertainty about time using imprecise temporal expressions (ITEs). Unfortunately, modern virtual assistants often lack system support to capture the intents behind these expressions. This can result in unnatural interactions and undesirable interruptions (e.g., having a work reminder delivered at 12pm when out at lunch, because the user said "this afternoon"). In this paper we explore existing practices, expectations, and preferences surrounding the use of ITEs. Our mixed methods approach employs surveys, interviews, and an analysis of a large corpus of written communications. We find that people frequently use a diverse set of ITEs in both communication and planning. These uses reflect a variety of motivations, such as conveying uncertainty or task priority. In addition, we find that people have a variety of expectations about time input and management when interacting with virtual assistants. We conclude with design implications for future virtual assistants.},

We present the Augmented Studio, an augmented reality system that uses body tracking to project anatomical structures and annotations over moving bodies for physiotherapy education. Through a user and learner centered design approach, we established an understanding that through augmentation and annotation, augmented reality technology can enhance physiotherapy education. Augmented Studio enables augmentation through projection mapping to display anatomical information such as muscles and skeleton in real time on the body as it moves. We created a technique for annotation to create projected hand-drawing on the moving body, to enable explicit communication of the teacher's clinical reasoning strategies to the students. Findings from our pilot usability study demonstrate a more engaging learning and teaching experience and increased communication between teacher and students when using Augmented Studio.},

We conducted interviews with staff and volunteers that used ThoughtCloud before, during and after its deployment, and workshops with service users and staff. While the collection of feedback was high, only one organisation regularly reviewed and responded to collected opinions. Furthermore, tensions arose around data access and sharing, and the mismatch of values between "giving voice" and the capacity for staff to engage in feedback practices.

 abstract = {Ubiquitous access is an increasingly common vision of computing, wherein users can interact with any computing device or service from anywhere, at any time. In the era of personal computing, users with visual impairments required special-purpose, assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to interact with computers. This paper investigates whether technologies like screen readers have kept pace with, or have created a barrier to, the trend toward ubiquitous access, with a specific focus on desktop computing as this is still the primary way computers are used in education and employment. Towards that, the paper presents a user study with 21 visually-impaired participants, specifically involving the switching of screen readers within and across different computing platforms, and the use of screen readers in remote access scenarios. Among the findings, the study shows that, even for remote desktop access - an early forerunner of true ubiquitous access - screen readers are too limited, if not unusable. The study also identifies several accessibility needs, such as uniformity of navigational experience across devices, and recommends potential solutions. In summary, assistive technologies have not made the jump into the era of ubiquitous access, and multiple, inconsistent screen readers create new practical problems for users with visual impairments.},

One area where policy, technology, and design intersect is in the vision of the creative economy. In that vision, creativity, distinct local/regional cultural practices, technology, and entrepreneurship synergistically produce social innovation on a scale sufficient to drive economies. Culture and creative industries (CCI) policy specifies how governments intervene to support such clusters. Maker cultures are seen as central to this vision, but comparatively little is known about how makers produce culture. We offer a critical analysis of several encounters between CCI policy in Taiwan and its maker scene. These encounters reveal misalignments that undercut efforts intended to support making. We propose that supporting any creative culture, including making, entails a serious commitment to understanding its culture, including its cultural contents and their means of production. We further argue that scholarly rigor in cultivating cultural appreciation is just as fundamental as scholarly rigor in empirically representing cultural practices when it comes to pursuing such a cultural understanding.},

In this study, we evaluate user perceptions of haptic stimuli generated by air vortex rings on the cheek and investigate the effects on their physiological responses. To develop a cheek haptic display, we investigated and found that the cheek had enough resolution to perceive the differences in haptic stimuli in a two-point discrimination threshold test of the face. Additionally, the intensities of the haptic stimuli for experiments were determined by investigating the subjective impressions of different stimuli pairs. Finally, we conducted experiments to evaluate quantitatively the effects of four different combinations of haptic stimuli on the physiological responses in terms of stress modification, brainwave activities, task performance, and subjective assessment. The results suggest that different stimuli affect physiological responses and task performance.},

 abstract = {Until vehicles are fully autonomous, safety, legal and ethical obligations require that drivers remain aware of the driving situation. Key decisions about whether a driver can take over when the vehicle is confused, or its capabilities are degraded, depend on understanding whether he or she is responsive and aware of external conditions. The leading techniques for measuring situation awareness in simulated environments are ill-suited to autonomous driving scenarios, and particularly to on-road testing. We have developed a technique, named Daze, to measure situation awareness through real-time, in-situ event alerts. The technique is ecologically valid: it resembles applications people use in actual driving. It is also flexible: it can be used in both simulator and on-road research settings. We performed simulator-based and on-road test deployments to (a) check that Daze could characterize drivers' awareness of their immediate environment and (b) understand practical aspects of the technique's use. Our contributions include the Daze technique, examples of collected data, and ways to analyze such data.},

Although prior work documents a decrease in social interaction following brain injury, little is known about how individuals with TBI engage in social behavior during their recovery, how others in their lives participate, and how these interactions occur in both online and offline contexts. We examine these issues through an interview study involving individuals with TBI, as well as caregivers and social contacts of individuals with TBI. Our analysis identifies the concept of social re-emergence, a non-linear process of developing a new social identity that involves withdrawing from social life, developing goals for social participation, disclosing health information for social support and acceptance, and attaining social independence.},

The traditional representation of subtitles displays text centered at the bottom of the screen. This layout can lead to large distances between text and relevant image content, causing eye strain and even that we miss visual content. As a recent alternative, the technique of speaker-following subtitles places subtitle text in speech bubbles close to the current speaker. We conducted a controlled eye-tracking laboratory study (n = 40) to compare the regular approach (center-bottom subtitles) with content-sensitive, speaker-following subtitles. We compared different dialog-heavy video clips with the two layouts. Our results show that speaker-following subtitles lead to higher fixation counts on relevant image regions and reduce saccade length, which is an important factor for eye strain.},

Evaluation of our model shows that multimodal data combining positional, dynamic and physiological information allows for a better characterization of Laban Efforts.

We first translate the scale into seven languages while preserving its reliability and structure validity. We then build a regression model to study which factors affect participants' security behavior. We find that participants from different countries exhibit different behavior. For instance, participants from Asian countries, and especially Japan, tend to exhibit less secure behavior. Surprisingly to us, we also find that actual knowledge influences user behavior much less than user self-confidence in their computer security knowledge.

With Float, a user tilts the wrist to point and performs an in-air finger tap to click. To realize Float, we first explore the appropriate motion space for wrist tilt and determine the clicking action (finger tap) through a user-elicitation study. We combine the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal with accelerometer and gyroscope to detect finger taps with a recall of 97.9% and a false discovery rate of 0.4%. Experiments show that using just one hand, Float allows users to acquire targets with size ranging from 2mm to 10mm in less than 2s to 1s, meanwhile achieve much higher accuracy than direct touch in both stationary (>98.9%) and walking (>71.5%) contexts.},

Building on prior work in ICTD and infrastructure studies, this paper explores the problem of inclusion through historical and ethnographic study of Aadhaar, India's biometrics-based national identification project. We illustrate tensions between Aadhaar users' ability to register, authenticate and successfully deploy their registered identity to participate in the Public Distribution System (PDS), a government scheme that provides subsidized food grains to the Indian poor. We argue that rather than an all-or-nothing state, inclusion in ICTD infrastructures is an ongoing and fragile process, achieved (unevenly) at the seams of multiple interconnected systems. Finally, we show that questions of (effective) inclusion are determined not just at margins of a system (who is in and who is out) but also through the artful and often challenging negotiation of the seams that run through and connect complex distributed infrastructures.},

 abstract = {Despite the long development of Graphical User Interfaces, working with multiple graphical objects remains a challenge, due to the difficulties of forming complex selections, ambiguities of operations, and tediousness of repetitively unselect-reselect or ungroup-regroup objects. Instead of tackling them as individual problems, we attribute it to the lack of system support to the general selection-action cycles. We propose Collection Objects to not only support a single fast selection-action cycle but also allow multiple cycles to be chained together into a fluid workflow. Collection Objects unifies selection, grouping, and manipulation of aggregate selections into a single object, with which selection can be composed with various techniques, modified for later actions, grouped with objects inside still directly accessible, and quasi-moded for less context switching. We implemented Collection Object in the context of a vector drawing application with simultaneous pen and touch input. Results of an expert evaluation show that Collection Objects holds considerable promises for fluid interaction with multiple objects.},

At furniture-scale, such artifacts have the potential of changing the ways we collaborate and engage with interiors and physical spaces. Informed by theories of proxemics, empirical studies of informal meetings and design work with shape-changing furniture, we develop the notion of proxemic transitions. We present three design aspects of proxemic transitions: transition speed, stepwise reconfiguration, and radical shifts. The design aspects focus on how to balance between physical and digital transformations in designing for proxemic transitions. Our contribution is three-fold: 1) the notion of proxemic transitions, 2) three design aspects to consider in designing for proxemic transitions, and 3) initial exploration of how these design aspects might generate designs of dynamic furniture. These contributions outline important aspects to consider when designing shape-changing furniture for informal workplace meetings.},

A key benefit of our approach is that the resulting objects can be 3D printed in one piece and thus do not require assembly. We are building on 3D printed cell structures, also known as metamaterials. We introduce a new type of cell that propagates a digital mechanical signal using an embedded bistable spring. When triggered, the embedded spring discharges and the resulting impulse triggers one or more neighboring cells, resulting in signal propagation. We extend this basic mechanism to implement simple logic functions. We demonstrate interactive objects based on this concept, such as a combination lock. We present a custom editor that allows users to model 3D objects, route signals, simulate signal flow, and synthesize cell patterns.},

This is achieved through kinesthetic channels based on electromyogram (EMG) measurement and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). We developed a pair of wearable kinesthetic input-output (I/O) devices called bioSync that uses specially designed electrodes to perform biosignal measurement and stimulation simultaneously on the same electrodes. In a user study, participants successfully evaluated the strength of their partners' muscle contractions while exerting their own muscles. We confirmed that the pair of devices could help participants synchronize their hand movements through tapping, without visual and auditory feedback. The proposed interpersonal kinesthetic communication system can be used to enhance interactions such as clinical gait rehabilitation and sports training, and facilitate sharing of physical experiences with Parkinson's patients, thereby enhancing understanding of the physical challenges they face in daily life.},

We aimed to determine whether automated recognition of facial expressions aided in predicting CAI engagement and learning performance. Seven youth with autism (mean age = 12.7, SD = 4.2) interacted with a CAI program, TeachTown Basics, for 15 consecutive sessions. Video recordings of the participants' faces were collected during these sessions and facial expressions from these videos were analyzed using CERT, an algorithm that automatically outputs intensity values for each facial action unit (AU). Using these data, we attempted to operationally define two engagement indices: (1) behavioral engagement, the proportion of time a participant had their face oriented to the computer screen; and (2) emotional engagement, the activation of AUs previously associated with CAI. Our results suggest that both indices strongly correlated with one another, but that emotional (not behavioral) engagement predicted test performance. CAI knowledge domain, participant sex, and developmental age also contributed to the prediction.},

A growing corpus of qualitative research focuses on trolling, and differentiates it from other forms of abuse; however, its findings are not directly actionable into automated systems. On the other hand, quantitative research uses definitions of "troll" that mostly fail to capture what moderators and users consider trolling. We address this gap by giving a quantitative analysis of posts, conversations, and users, specifically sanctioned for trolling in an online forum. Although trolls (unlike most other abusers) hardly stand out in a conversation e.g. in terms of vocabulary, textit{how} they interact, rather than textit{what} they contribute, provides cues of their malicious intent.},

We discuss two major themes: a) the tensions related to perceived digital threats and the social pressures of online disclosure to the social environment; and b) the relation of these issues to the ICT appropriation process and the referring challenges we encountered. We argue that there is a need to understand the interleaving of physical and virtual habitats, the various ways resulting in discomfort and the senior citizens' actions -- which at first glance appear contradictory.

In the computer security community, we don't know what behaviors people understand well enough to self-report accurately, or how well those self-reports correlate with what people actually do. In a six week field study, we collected both behavior data and survey responses from 122 subjects. We found that a relatively small number of behaviors -- mostly related to tasks that require users to take a specific, regular action -- have non-zero correlations. Since security is almost never a user's primary task for everyday computer users, several important security behaviors that we directly measured were not self-reported accurately. These results suggest that security research based on self-report is only reliable for certain behaviors. Additionally, a number of important security behaviors are not sufficiently salient to users that they can self-report accurately.},

Findings from an elicitation study with seven radiologists provided necessary domain knowledge to guide prototype design. Finally, a clinical field study with 14 pediatric patients, their parents and clinicians, revealed positive responses of each stakeholder when using the prototype to interact with and discuss the patient's current CT or MRI report and allowed us to distill three use cases: co-located communication, preparing for the consultation, and reviewing radiology data.

We conducted a study with 20 low vision participants and 18 sighted controls, asking them to identify virtual shapes and text in different sizes, colors, and thicknesses. We also evaluated their ability to see the virtual elements while walking. We found that low vision participants were able to identify basic shapes and read short phrases on the glasses while sitting and walking. Identifying virtual elements had a similar effect on low vision and sighted people's walking speed, slowing it down slightly. Our study yielded preliminary evidence that mainstream AR glasses can be powerful accessibility tools.

However, there is a lack of understanding about how accurately different intensities of these effects support popout, particularly as targets move further from the center of the visual field. We therefore conducted a study to examine the accuracy of popout target identification using different visual variables, each at five different levels of intensity, and at a wide range of angles from the display center. Results show that motion is a strong popout stimulus, even at low intensities and wide angles. Identification accuracy decreases rapidly across visual angle with other popout stimuli, particularly with shape and color. The findings have relevance to a wide variety of applications, particularly as multi-display desktop environments increase in size and visual extent.},

Little is known about the combination of a physical indicator with an automatic interruptibility measure and its long-term impact in the workplace. In our research, we developed the FlowLight, that combines a physical traffic-light like LED with an automatic interruptibility measure based on computer interaction data. In a large-scale and long-term field study with 449 participants from 12 countries, we found, amongst other results, that the FlowLight reduced the interruptions of participants by 46%, increased their awareness on the potential disruptiveness of interruptions and most participants never stopped using it.},

With a goal of explaining variance in novices' typing performance that is attributable to visual search, a model was designed to predict how users learn to locate keys on a keyboard: initially relying on visual short-term memory but then transitioning to recall-based search. This allows predicting search times and visual search patterns for completely and partially new layouts. The model complements models of motor performance and learning in text entry by predicting change in visual search patterns over time. Practitioners can use it for estimating how long it takes to reach the desired level of performance with a given layout.},

We propose EmotionActuator, a proof-of-concept system to investigate the transmission of emotional states in which the recipient performs emotional gestures to understand and interpret the state of the sender.We call this kind of communication embodied emotional feedback, and present a prototype implementation. To realize our concept we chose four emotional states: amused, sad, angry, and neutral. We designed EmotionActuator through a series of studies to assess emotional classification via EEG, and create an EMS gesture set by comparing composed gestures from the literature to sign-language gestures. Through a final study with the end-to-end prototype interviews revealed that participants like implicit sharing of emotions and find the embodied output to be immersive, but want to have control over shared emotions and with whom. This work contributes a proof of concept system and set of design recommendations for designing embodied emotional feedback systems.},

The context-based nature of such glances allows for application of supervised learning to the problem of vision-based gaze estimation, making it robust, accurate, and reliable in messy, real-world conditions. So, it's valuable to ask whether such macro-glances can be used to infer behavioral, environmental, and demographic variables? We analyze 27 binary classification problems based on these variables. The takeaway is that glance can be used as part of a multi-sensor real-time system to predict radio-tuning, fatigue state, failure to signal, talking, and several environment variables.},

To explore this topic, we use qualitative data from over 150 interviews with personal email users as well as quantitative data from several larger survey-based studies. We will show that personal email use is very different from what has been previously studied by workplace researchers and that daily use is largely focused on receiving and viewing B2C messages such as coupons, deals, receipts, and event notifications with personal communication over email diminished to a rarer, less-than-daily occurrence. We discuss the implications of this for the design of email and communications clients and present a design and prototype for an application that seeks to support these more frequent uses of consumer email.},

 abstract = {360-degree filming and head-mounted displays (HMDs) give recorded media a new sense of space. Theatre practitioners' expertise in manipulating spatial interactions has much to contribute to immersive recorded content. Four theatre directors led teams of three actors to stage the same scene for both immersive theatre and for 360-degree filming. Each team was recorded performing the scene at least six times, three in each condition, to extract actors' coordinates. This study establishes how to quantify theatre practitioners' use of spatial interactions and examines the spatial adaptations made when transferring these relationships to 360-degree filming. Staging for a 360-degree camera compared to staging for an audience member had shorter distances from the camera and between performers, along with fewer instances of the camera being in the middle of the action. Across all groups, interpersonal distance between characters and between the audience/camera dropped at the end of the scene when the characters come together as a team, suggesting that elements of Proxemics may be applicable to narrative performance.},

Existing techniques, such as zoom-and-pan on a 2D plane and hyperbolic browser facilitate large graph exploration by showing both the details of a focal area and its surrounding context that guides the exploration process. However, existing techniques for large graph exploration are limited in either providing too little context or presenting graphs with too much distortion. In this paper, we propose a novel focus+context technique, iSphere, to address the limitation. iSphere maps a large graph onto a Riemann Sphere that better preserves graph structures and shows greater context information. We conduct extensive experiment studies on different graph exploration tasks under various conditions. The results show that iSphere performs the best in task completion time compared to the baseline techniques in link and path exploration tasks. This research also contributes to understanding large graph exploration on small screens.},

However, the advent of such "human-like" technology has stirred both awe and a great deal of fear. Many consider it a woe to have an unimaginable future where human intelligence is exceeded by AI. This paper investigates how people perceive and understand AI with a case study of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, a Go match between Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, in March 2016. This study explores the underlying and changing perspectives toward AI as users experienced this historic event. Interviews with 22 participants show that users tacitly refer to AlphaGo as an "other" as if it were comparable to a human, while dreading that it would come back to them as a potential existential threat. Our work illustrates a confrontational relationship between users and AI, and suggests the need to prepare for a new kind of user experience in this nascent socio- technological change. It calls for a collaborative research effort from the HCI community to study and accommodate users for a future where they interact with algorithms, not just interfaces.},

To better understand the forms of empathy experienced by people observing animal-computer interaction, we designed and studied an interactive installation for orangutans at a zoo. Through collaborative design we established an understanding of zoos' objectives and strategies related to empathy in the zoo context. We deployed a prototype installation, and observed and interviewed visitors who watched orangutans use the installation. Analysis of observations and interviews revealed that visitors responded with cognitive, affective and motor empathy for the animals. We propose that these empathetic responses are prompted by the visibility of orangutans' bodily movements, by the "anthropic frame" provided by digital technology, and by prompting reflection on animals' cognitive processes and affective states. This paper contributes new evidence and understanding of people's empathetic responses to observing animal-computer interaction and confirms the value of designing for empathy in its various forms},

This paper explores the relationship that mosques in Bangladesh have with their constituencies and with technology, with an eye toward the integration of technology with existing religious institutions as a way to achieve positive social ends. We first describe a qualitative exploration of several mosque communities in Bangladesh, where we find that skepticism and pragmatism about modern technology interact in a complex way that nevertheless leaves room for technical interventions. We then describe a randomized controlled trial to study the relative value of SMS messages infused with overtly religious or secularly altruistic frames for the purpose of mosque fundraising. We find that SMS messages increase donations overall, but that their framing is significant. Messages with secular altruistic framing increased donations by 9.5%, while those with religious sentiment increased donations by 57.3%. Our findings demonstrate how technologies like SMS amplify underlying religious forces and suggest the possibility of working with religious institutions in applying positive ICT interventions.},

We found that ChartSense was more accurate than ReVision. In addition, to evaluate data extraction performance, we conducted a user study, comparing ChartSense with WebPlotDigitizer, one of the most effective chart data extraction tools among publicly accessible ones.

As a result, increasing text entry speed of expert typists is an important design goal for physical and soft keyboards. Mathematical models that predict text entry speed can help with keyboard design and optimization. Making typing errors when entering text is inevitable. However, current models do not consider how typists themselves reduce the risk of making typing errors (and lower error frequency) by typing more slowly. We demonstrate that users respond to costly typing errors by reducing their typing speed to minimize typing errors. We present a model that estimates the effects of risk aversion to errors on typing speed. We estimate the magnitude of this speed change, and show that disregarding the adjustments to typing speed that expert typists use to reduce typing errors leads to overly optimistic estimates of maximum errorless expert typing speeds.},

To fill this gap in the research, we surveyed and interviewed parents to understand (1) their values and perceptions of this type of gameplay and (2) how they co-play Pokémon GO with their children. Our findings provide empirical evidence that, in addition to appreciating the increased exercise and time outdoors, parents valued how play led to family bonding experiences. Furthermore, some traditional concerns about screen time persisted in this context, and new concerns about safety in real-world environments emerged. Parents mitigated these concerns with rules and gameplay choices, such as maintaining control of the mobile device, to ensure children were safe. This work contributes an empirical understanding of families as co-users of technology and offers a generative lens to study and design for joint media engagement among family members where gameplay differs from normative notions of screen time.},

 abstract = {Development of a rich hand-gesture-based interface is currently a tedious process, requiring expertise in computer vision and/or machine learning. We address this problem by introducing a simple language for pose and gesture description, a set of development tools for using it, and an algorithmic pipeline that recognizes it with high accuracy. The language is based on a small set of basic propositions, obtained by applying four predicate types to the fingers and to palm center: direction, relative location, finger touching and finger folding state. This enables easy development of a gesture-based interface, using coding constructs, gesture definition files or an editing GUI. The language is recognized from 3D camera input with an algorithmic pipeline composed of multiple classification/regression stages, trained on a large annotated dataset. Our experimental results indicate that the pipeline enables successful gesture recognition with a very low computational load, thus enabling a gesture-based interface on low-end processors.},

 abstract = {Strong user engagement with digital technologies for behaviour change is often taken as a precursor to their longer-term efficacy. We critically examine this assumption through a qualitative study of a smoking cessation app, called NewLeaf, which allows quitters to swap personal stories. The study examined what influenced people to engage or disengage with NewLeaf, and how the app was deployed in quit attempts during a four week trial. Several properties of swapped stories were reported to promote engagement, including: authenticity, currency, contextualization of advice, and evoking a sense of community. But while the resulting engagement was sometimes productive in supporting quitting, other trajectories of use were observed involving counterproductive engagement, and a surprising pattern of productive disengagement especially among stronger quitters. We discuss how this analysis of different trajectories problematizes any simple interpretation of user engagement as an early indicator of success for behaviour change technologies.},

In this paper we present a case study with our tool Helpstone, a live-streaming tool for the card game Hearthstone. Helpstone provides several new communication channels that allow for a better viewer-streamer interaction. We evaluated the tool within a live-streaming session with 23 viewers using Helpstone, and interviewed the streamer. The results indicate that not every implemented interactivity option is relevant. However, in general, new communication channels appear to be valuable and novel influence options are appreciated.},

Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is a psychotherapeutic treatment, which requires patients to track sleep and share the data with CBT-I clinicians. However, the number of specialists who can provide CBT-I limits the number of patients who can receive it. In this paper, we aim to identify opportunities to leverage technology to assist clinicians in delivering quality and effective CBT-I services to broader populations. Toward this goal, we conducted formative studies, including 11 CBT-I clinic observations and 17 semi-structured interviews, to understand the current workflow of CBT-I and associated challenges. We discuss how technology can assist clinicians and patients throughout the various steps of CBT-I workflow while addressing some of the identified challenges, and more broadly, how technology can make space for clinicians and patients to build quality therapeutic relationships.},

We studied a representative team formation tool (CATME) in eight project-based courses. An instructor uses the tool to form teams by surveying students' working styles, skills, and demographics; then configuring these criteria as input into an algorithm that assigns teams. We surveyed students (N=277) in the courses to gauge their perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool and ideas for improving it. We also interviewed instructors (N=13) different from those who taught the eight courses to learn about their criteria selections and perceptions of the tool. Students valued the rational basis for forming teams but desired a stronger voice in criteria selection and explanations as to why they were assigned to a particular team. Instructors appreciated the efficiency of team formation but wanted to view exemplars of criteria used in similar courses.

Best practices identified include: reconfigurable interfaces and mappings; object-oriented packaging of AV and UI; diverse sound visualization; flexible media manipulation and management. The toolkit and a mobile app developed using it have been released as open-source.

Our empirical results show that PFIS-V is up to 25% more accurate than PFIS3 in predicting where a forager will navigate in a variationed information space.},

In this paper, we propose TopoGroups, a novel context-preserving technique that aggregates spatial data into hierarchical clusters to improve exploration and navigation at multiple spatial scales. The technique uses a boundary distortion algorithm to minimize the visual clutter caused by overlapping aggregates. Our user study explores multiple visual encoding strategies for TopoGroups including color, transparency, shading, and shapes in order to convey the hierarchical and statistical information of the geographical aggregates at different scales.},

 abstract = {As devices around us become smart, our gaze is poised to become the next frontier of human-computer interaction (HCI). State-of-the-art mobile eye tracker systems typically rely on eye-model-based gaze estimation approaches, which do not require a calibration. However, such approaches require specialized hardware (e.g., multiple cameras and glint points), can be significantly affected by glasses, and, thus, are not fit for ubiquitous gaze-based HCI. In contrast, regression-based gaze estimations are straightforward approaches requiring solely one eye and one scene camera but necessitate a calibration. Therefore, a fast and accurate calibration is a key development to enable ubiquitous gaze-based HCI. In this paper, we introduce CalibMe, a novel method that exploits collection markers (automatically detected fiducial markers) to allow eye tracker users to gather a large array of calibration points, remove outliers, and automatically reserve evaluation points in a fast and unsupervised manner. The proposed approach is evaluated against a nine-point calibration method, which is typically used due to its relatively short calibration time and adequate accuracy. CalibMe reached a mean angular error of 0.59 (0=0.23) in contrast to 0.82 (0=0.15) for a nine-point calibration, attesting for the efficacy of the method. Moreover, users are able to calibrate the eye tracker anywhere and independently in - 10 s using a cellphone to display the collection marker.},

It can accurately detect fingertips, their locations, and whether they are touching the skin or hovering above it. It extends previous work that supported either mid-air or multitouch input by simultaneously supporting both. We demonstrate feasibility with a compact, wearable prototype attached to a user's forearm (simulating an integrated depth sensor). Our prototype---which runs in real-time on consumer mobile devices---enables a 3D input space on the back of the hand. We evaluated the accuracy and robustness of the approach in a user study.

 abstract = {Computation is a powerful artistic medium. Artists with experience in programming have demonstrated the unique creative opportunities of using code to make art. Currently, manual artists interested in using procedural techniques must undergo the difficult process of learning to program, and must adopt tools and practices far removed from those to which they are accustomed. We hypothesize that, through the right direct manipulation interface, we can enable accessible and expressive procedural art creation. To explore this, we developed Para, a digital illustration tool that supports the creation of declarative constraints in vector artwork. Para's constraints enable procedural relationships while facilitating live manual control and non-linear editing. Constraints can be combined with duplication behaviors and ordered collections of artwork to produce complex, dynamic compositions. We use the results of two open-ended studies with professional artists and designers to provide guidelines for accessible tools that integrate manual and procedural expression.},

 abstract = {A major inhibitor of the effectiveness of security warnings is habituation: decreased response to a repeated warning. Although habituation develops over time, previous studies have examined habituation and possible solutions to its effects only within a single experimental session, providing an incomplete view of the problem. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal experiment that examines how habituation develops over the course of a five-day workweek and how polymorphic warnings decrease habituation. We measured habituation using two complementary methods simultaneously: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking. Our results show a dramatic drop in attention throughout the workweek despite partial recovery between workdays. We also found that the polymorphic warning design was substantially more resistant to habituation compared to conventional warnings, and it sustained this advantage throughout the five-day experiment. Our findings add credibility to prior studies by showing that the pattern of habituation holds across a workweek, and indicate that cross-sectional habituation studies are valid proxies for longitudinal studies. Our findings also show that eye tracking is a valid measure of the mental process of habituation to warnings.},

Our initial (qualitative) study explored how users interact with various mobile phone types (touchscreen, physical keyboard and stylus). The analysis of the videos revealed that each type of mobile phone affords specific handgrips and that the user shifts these grips and consequently the tilt and rotation of the phone depending on the context of interaction. In order to further investigate the tilt and rotation effects we conducted a controlled quantitative study in which we varied the size of the phone and the type of grips (Symmetric bimanual, Asymmetric bimanual with finger, Asymmetric bimanual with thumb and Single handed) to better understand how they affect the tilt and rotation during a dual pointing task. The results showed that the size of the phone does have a consequence and that the distance needed to reach action items affects the phones' tilt and rotation. Additionally, we found that the amount of tilt, rotation and reach required corresponded with the participant's grip preference. We finish the paper by discussing the design lessons for mobile UI and proposing design guidelines and applications for these insights.},

Our analysis focused on how the programmers arranged and navigated among open information patches (i.e., code modules and program output). Key findings of our study included that Patchworks users made significantly fewer click actions per navigation, juxtaposed patches side by side significantly more, and exhibited significantly fewer navigation mistakes than tabbed-editor users.

We articulate our four levels along with specific design qualities through concrete examples of existing mindfulness apps and through research through design (RtD) work conducted with design fiction examples. We then use a working design case prototype to further illustrate the possibilities of presence-with and presence-in.

We develop a conceptual model and associated analysis algorithms that allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. We analyze a case of rumoring on Twitter during the Boston Marathon Bombing. We find that rumor spreading was predominantly a parallel process in this case, which is consistent with a hypothesis that information silos may underlie the persistence of false rumors.

When attached to the fingers, a single voicecoil actuator presents a translation guidance cue and a pair of voicecoil actuators presents a rotation guidance cue. The directionality of mechanoreceptors in the skin led to our choice of the location and orientation of the actuators in order to elicit very strong sensations in certain directions. For example, users distinguished a "left" cue versus a "right" cue 94.5% of the time. When presented with one of six possible direction cues, users on average correctly identified the direction of translation cues 86.1% of the time and rotation cues 69.0% of the time.},

In our first study, we directly compare traditional sketching on a physical surface to sketching in VR, with and without a physical surface to rest the stylus on. Our results indicate that the lack of a physical drawing surface is a major cause of inaccuracies in VR drawing, and that the effect is dependent on the orientation of the drawing surface. In a second experiment, we evaluate the extent to which visual guidance can compensate for the loss of sketching precision in VR. We found that while additional visual guidance improves positional accuracy, it can be detrimental to the aesthetic quality of strokes. We conclude by distilling our experimental findings into design guidelines for sketching tools in immersive 3D environments.},

We contribute directly to this challenge by providing an empirical account of a charity whose work is built on the underlying move towards social and criminal justice for sex workers in the UK. Through ethnographic fieldwork, meetings, interviews, surveys, and creative workshops we describe the different points of view associated with the charity from a variety of stakeholders. We discuss their service provision and the ways in which HCI is uniquely positioned to be able respond to the needs of and to support sex work support services.},

We took a privacy-by-design approach to the system in the early stages of its development, working with older adults to firstly understand their networks of trust and secondly understand their privacy concerns should information be exchanged across that network. We used a Johari Windows framework in the thematic analysis of our data, concluding that the social sharing of information in later life carried significant risk.

 abstract = {Since its earliest days, harassment and abuse have plagued the Internet. Recent research has focused on in-domain methods to detect abusive content and faces several challenges, most notably the need to obtain large training corpora. In this paper, we introduce a novel computational approach to address this problem called Bag of Communities (BoC)---a technique that leverages large-scale, preexisting data from other Internet communities. We then apply BoC toward identifying abusive behavior within a major Internet community. Specifically, we compute a post's similarity to 9 other communities from 4chan, Reddit, Voat and MetaFilter. We show that a BoC model can be used on communities "off the shelf" with roughly 75% accuracy---no training examples are needed from the target community. A dynamic BoC model achieves 91.18% accuracy after seeing 100,000 human-moderated posts, and uniformly outperforms in-domain methods. Using this conceptual and empirical work, we argue that the BoC approach may allow communities to deal with a range of common problems, like abusive behavior, faster and with fewer engineering resources.},

However, this work has not led to wide support of gesturing in commercial groupware systems. In contrast, Dota 2, a popular MOBA game, provides two frequently-used gesturing tools: annotations - freely drawn lines on top of the gamespace - and pings - a combination of animation and sound indicating a point of interest. While gesturing tools are important for quickly coordinating with teammates in Dota 2, there is little information about how and why people use them. To gather this information, we performed two complementary studies: an interaction analysis of eight game replays, and a survey of 167 experienced players. Our findings include: six distinct motivations for the use of gesturing tools; when and how frequently gesture motivations occur during games; and, that players find pings an essential tool for winning, but not annotations. Our findings provide new directions for the design of gesturing tools in groupware and online games.},

These developments suggest that the HCI community should engage with and respond to concerns that are external to computing yet profoundly impact human society. In this paper we observe that taking these broader contexts into account yields a fundamentally different way to think about sustainable interaction design, one in which the designer's focus must be on a) ecological limits, b) creating designs and artifacts that do not further a cornucopian paradigm, and c) fundamental human needs. It can be hard to be responsive to these contexts in practical HCI work. To address this, we propose that the design rubric of disintermediation can serve as a unifying approach for work that aims to meet the ecological and economic challenges outlined in the literature. After discussing the potential use and impact of disintermedation, we perform an analysis using this design rubric to several key application areas.},

Immersive HMDs are becoming everyday consumer items and, as they offer new possibilities for entertainment and productivity, people will want to use them during travel in, for example, autonomous cars. However, their use is confounded by motion sickness caused in-part by the restricted visual perception of motion conflicting with physically perceived vehicle motion (accelerations/rotations detected by the vestibular system). Whilst VR HMDs restrict visual perception of motion, they could also render it virtually, potentially alleviating sensory conflict. To study this problem, we conducted the first on-road and in motion study to systematically investigate the effects of various visual presentations of the real-world motion of a car on the sickness and immersion of VR HMD wearing passengers. We established new baselines for VR in-car motion sickness, and found that there is no one best presentation with respect to balancing sickness and immersion. Instead, user preferences suggest different solutions are required for differently susceptible users to provide usable VR in-car. This work provides formative insights for VR designers and an entry point for further research into enabling use of VR HMDs, and the rich experiences they offer, when travelling.},

We present two experiments. First, we determined that people strongly preferred higher pressures to be mapped to higher gain factors. Using this mapping, we compared pressure with rate control, velocity control, and slider-based control in a second study. Our results show that pressure-based gain control allows people to be more precise in the same amount of time compared to established input modalities. Pressure-based control was also clearly preferred by our participants. In summary, we demonstrate that pressure facilitates effective and efficient precision control for mobile 3D navigation.},

The Respeak engine aligned the transcript generated by five randomly selected users to transcribe Hindi and Indian English audio files with a word error rate (WER) of 8.6% and 15.2%, respectively. The cost of speech transcription was USD 0.83 per minute with a turnaround time of 39.8 hours, substantially less than industry standards. Using a mixed-methods analysis of cognitive experiments, system performance and qualitative interviews, we evaluate Respeak's design, user experience, strengths, and weaknesses.

This paper examines how the communication members receive in an health support community influences their commitment and how this influence changes with their tenure in the community. Commitment was operationalized with three measures: self-reported attachment, continued participation in the community, and responding to others. Results show that receiving communication was generally associated with increased commitment across the three measures, with its impact increasing with members' tenure. However, the average amount of informational and emotional support members received per message was associated with decreased commitment.

Head-tracker measurements are then calibrated to these known viewpoints. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of different visual patterns and different display shapes. We found that the easiest to align shape was the spherical display and the best calibration pattern was the combination of circles and lines. We performed a quantitative camera-based calibration of a cubic display and found visual calibration outperformed manual tuning and generated viewpoint calibrations accurate to within a degree. Our work removes the usual, burdensome step of manual calibration when using head-tracked displays and paves the way for wider adoption of this inexpensive and effective 3D display technology.},

 abstract = {Work breaks can play an important role in the mental and physical well-being of workers and contribute positively to productivity. In this paper we explore the use of activity-, physiological-, and indoor-location sensing to promote mobility during work-breaks. While the popularity of devices and applications to promote physical activity is growing, prior research highlights important constraints when designing for the workplace. With these constraints in mind, we developed BreakSense, a mobile application that uses a Bluetooth beacon infrastructure, a smartphone and a smartwatch to encourage mobility during breaks with a game-like design. We discuss constraints imposed by design for work and the workplace, and highlight challenges associated with the use of noisy sensors and methods to overcome them. We then describe a short deployment of BreakSense within our lab that examined bound vs. unbound augmented breaks and how they affect users' sense of completion and readiness to work.},

 abstract = {Loyalty cards are a form of tracking and recording technology (TRT) that enables retailers to collect data about their customers' demographic and purchase behaviours. As recompense for sharing their data consumers receive 'loyalty points' which they can redeem for exclusive discounts and rewards. The design of loyalty schemes, and TRTs more generally, plays a key role in defining the economic terms of that exchange, and ultimately the economic value of personal data. In this paper we present findings from an interview study with 12 loyalty cardholders in the UK explicating the ways in which they create (and lose) value through the everyday practice of shopping with loyalty cards and the orientations associated with them. Based on our findings we suggest cardholders are less concerned with the protection of their privacy than with leveraging its value, only some of which was economic. We provide design guidelines for TRTs that may enable consumers to derive greater value from the data they produce and share.},

This question is especially relevant when familiar methods themselves can have shortcomings: many visualizations used conventionally for scientific data analysis and presentation do not follow established best practices. This necessitates new methods that might be unfamiliar yet prove to be more effective. But there is little empirical understanding of the relationships between scientists' subjective impressions about familiar and unfamiliar visualizations and objective measures of their visual analytic judgments. To address this gap and to study these factors, we focus on visualizations used for comparison of climate model performance. We report on a comprehensive survey-based user study with 47 climate scientists and present an analysis of: i) relationships among scientists' familiarity, their perceived levels of comfort, confidence, accuracy, and objective measures of accuracy, and ii) relationships among domain experience, visualization familiarity, and post-study preference.},

In general, they are too expensive to scale to large surfaces, such as walls and furniture, and cannot provide input on objects having irregular and complex geometries, such as tools and toys. We introduce Electrick, a low-cost and versatile sensing technique that enables touch input on a wide variety of objects and surfaces, whether small or large, flat or irregular. This is achieved by using electric field tomography in concert with an electrically conductive material, which can be easily and cheaply added to objects and surfaces. We show that our technique is compatible with commonplace manufacturing methods, such as spray/brush coating, vacuum forming, and casting/molding enabling a wide range of possible uses and outputs. Our technique can also bring touch interactivity to rapidly fabricated objects, including those that are laser cut or 3D printed. Through a series of studies and illustrative example uses, we show that Electrick can enable new interactive opportunities on a diverse set of objects and surfaces that were previously static.},

Our work draws upon established cross-disciplinary literature relating to film photography and the composition of family albums in order to establish whether social media has changed the way parents visually present their families. We conducted a qualitative visual analysis of a sample of 4,000 photographs collected from Instagram using hashtags relating to children and parenting. We show that the style and composition of snapshots featuring children remains fundamentally unchanged and continues to be dominated by rather bland and idealised images of the happy family and the cute child. In addition, we find that the frequent taking and sharing of photographs via Instagram has inevitably resulted in a more mundane visual catalogue of daily life. We note a tension in the desire to use social media as a means to evidence good parenting, while trying to effectively manage the social identity of the child and finally, we note the reluctance of parents to use their own snapshots to portray family tension or disharmony, but their willingness to use externally generated content for this purpose.},

Rubrics help feedback providers but require domain experts to write them and may not generalize across design domains. This paper introduces and tests a novel semi-automated method to support feedback providers by analyzing feedback language. In our first study, 52 students from two design courses created design solutions and received feedback from 176 online providers. Instructors, students, and crowd contributors rated the helpfulness of each feedback response. From this data, an algorithm extracted a set of natural language features (e.g., specificity, sentiment etc.) that correlated with the ratings. The features accurately predicted the ratings and remained stable across different raters and design solutions. Based on these features, we produced a critique style guide with feedback examples - automatically selected for each feature - to help providers revise their feedback through self-assessment. In a second study, we tested the validity of the guide through a between-subjects experiment (n=50). Providers wrote feedback on design solutions with or without the guide. Providers generated feedback with higher perceived helpfulness when using our style-based guidance.},

 abstract = {When people hold their smartphone in landscape orientation, they use their thumbs for input on the frontal touchscreen, while their remaining fingers rest on the back of the device (BoD) to stabilize the grip. We present BackXPress, a new interaction technique that lets users create BoD pressure input with these remaining fingers to augment their interaction with the touchscreen on the front: Users can apply various pressure levels with each of these fingers to enter different temporary "quasi-modes" that are only active as long as that pressure is applied. Both thumbs can then interact with the frontal screen in that mode. We illustrate the practicality of BackXPress with several sample applications, and report our results from three user studies: Study 1 investigated which fingers can be used to exert BoD pressure and found index, middle, and ring finger from both hands to be practical. Study 2 revealed how pressure touches from these six fingers are distributed across the BoD. Study 3 examined user performance for applying BoD pressure (a) during single touches at the front and (b) for 20 seconds while touching multiple consecutive frontal targets. Participants achieved up to 92% pressure accuracy for three separate pressure levels above normal resting pressure, with the middle fingers providing the highest accuracy. BoD pressure did not affect frontal touch accuracy. We conclude with design guidelines for BoD pressure input.},

 abstract = {Health and wellbeing applications increasingly raise ethical issues for design. User-centred and participatory design approaches, while grounded in everyday wisdom, cannot be expected to address ethical reflection consistently, as multiple value systems come into play. We explore the potential of phronesis, a concept from Aristotelian virtue ethics, for mHealth design. Phronesis describes wisdom and judgment garnered from practical experience of specific situations in context. Applied phronesis contributes everyday wisdom to challenging issues for vulnerable target users. Drawing on research into mHealth technologies for psychological wellbeing, we explore how phronesis can inform ethical design. Using a case study on an app for self-reporting symptoms of depression during pregnancy, we present a framework for incorporating a phronetic approach into design, involving: (a) a wide feedback net to capture phronetic input early in design; (b) observing the order of feedback, which directly affects value priorities in design; (c) ethical pluralism recognising different coexisting value systems; (d) acknowledging subjectivity in the disclosure and recognition of individual researcher and participant values. We offer insights into how a phronetic approach can contribute everyday wisdom to designing mHealth technologies to help designers foster the values that promote human flourishing.},

We found that NNS often shifted between English and their native language. The way language shift happened differed for formal meetings, informal conversations, and instant messaging. Language variation was often associated with shifts in content, participants, and communication medium. Further analysis indicated that language shift had both benefits and costs for team communication, depending on the context in which it happened.

We aim to inform the design of tools to support healthy behaviors by understanding how people appropriate Instagram to track and share food data, the benefits they obtain from doing so, and the challenges they encounter. We interviewed 16 women who consistently record and share what they eat on Instagram. Participants tracked to support themselves and others in their pursuit of healthy eating goals. They sought social support for their own tracking and healthy behaviors and strove to provide that support for others. People adapted their personal tracking practices to better receive and give this support. Applying these results to the design of health tracking tools has the potential to help people better access social support.},

Long commute times make casual gaming in public transports and cars a common occupation. However, VR HMDs can currently not be used in moving vehicles since the car's rotation affects the HMD's sensors and simulator sickness occurs when the visual and vestibular system are stimulated with incongruent information. We present CarVR, a solution to enable VR in moving vehicles by subtracting the car's rotation and mapping vehicular movements with the visual information. This allows the user to actually feel correct kinesthetic forces during the VR experience. In a user study (n = 21), we compared CarVR inside a moving vehicle with the baseline of using VR without vehicle movements. We show that the perceived kinesthetic forces caused by CarVR increase enjoyment and immersion significantly while simulator sickness is reduced compared to a stationary VR experience. Finally, we explore the design space of in-car VR entertainment applications using real kinesthetic forces and derive design considerations for practitioners.},

We replicated this study in China to gain insight into how these user-defined interactions vary across the two cultures. We found that as per the US study, Chinese participants chose to interact primarily using gesture. However, Chinese participants used multi-modal interactions more than their US counterparts. Agreement for many proposed interactions was high within each culture. Across cultures, there were notable differences despite similarities in interaction modality preferences. For instance, culturally-specific gestures emerged in China, such as a T-shape gesture for stopping the drone. Participants from both cultures anthropomorphized the drone, and welcomed it into their personal space. We describe the implications of these findings on designing culturally-aware and intuitive human-drone interaction.},

Using a mixed-methods field study of smartphone adoption by 81 people with visual impairments in Bangalore, India, we argue that these positions are dated in the case of accessibility where a non-homogeneous population must adapt to technologies built for sighted people.

We propose WireFab, a rapid modeling and prototyping system that uses bent metal wires as the structure framework. WireFab approximates both the skeletal articulation and the skin appearance of the corresponding virtual skin meshes, and it allows users to personalize the designs by (1) specifying joint positions and part segmentations, (2) defining joint types and motion ranges to build a wire-based skeletal model, and (3) abstracting the segmented meshes into mixed-dimensional appearance patterns or attachments. The WireFab is designed to allow the user to choose how to best preserve the fidelity of the topological structure and articulation motion while selectively maintaining the fidelity of the geometric appearance. Compared to 3D-printing based high-fidelity fabrication systems, WireFab increases prototyping speed by ignoring unnecessary geometric details while preserving structural integrity and articulation motion. In addition, other rapid or low-fidelity fabrication systems produce only static models, while WireFab produces posable articulated models and has the potential to enable personalized functional products larger than the machines that produce them.},

We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 374 participants in the U.S. who responded to ten parenting blog posts. Subjects were randomized to view posts with either DIY or neutral language and either routine childcare activities (e.g., changing diapers) or interactive ones (e.g., finger painting). Results show that DIY language actually decreases a father's willingness to do a childcare activity. Further, fathers underestimate how socially appropriate it is for them to perform childcare activities and this misperception relates to their willingness to get involved. We draw on social norms literature to recommend next steps for designing interfaces to support father involvement in childrearing.},

 abstract = {Object manipulation in 3D virtual environments demands a combined coordination of rotations, translations and scales, as well as the camera control to change the user's viewpoint. Then, for many manipulation tasks, it would be advantageous to share the interaction complexity among team members. In this paper we propose a novel 3D manipulation interface based on a collaborative action coordination approach. Our technique explores a smartphone -- the touchscreen and inertial sensors -- as input interface, enabling several users to collaboratively manipulate the same virtual object with their own devices. We first assessed our interface design on a docking and an obstacle crossing tasks with teams of two users. Then, we conducted a study with 60 users to understand the influence of group size in collaborative 3D manipulation. We evaluated teams in combinations of one, two, three and four participants. Experimental results show that teamwork increases accuracy when compared with a single user. The accuracy increase is correlated with the number of individuals in the team and their work division strategy.},

We examine the factors promoting the successful uptake of a maker platform from two perspectives: first, we investigate the technical and user experience considerations that users identify as the most important. Second, we explore the specific activities that help attract a community and encourage sustained participation. We present an inductive approach based on the case study of Bela, an embedded platform for creating interactive audio systems. The technical design and community building processes are detailed, culminating in a successful crowdfunding campaign. To further understand the community dynamics, the paper also presents an intensive three-day workshop with eight digital musical instrument designers. From observations and interviews, we reflect on the relationship between the platform and the community and offer suggestions for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in establishing their own maker communities.},

Interactive technologies that increase task engagement could therefore offer safety benefits, e.g., through performance feedback, increased challenge, and incentives. As a means to build upon these notions, we chose to explore gamification of the driving task. The research aim was to study how to design gamified applications that make safe driving more engaging. We present six design lenses which bring into focus considerations most relevant to creating engaging car applications. A user study enhanced our understanding of design requirements and revealed user personas to support the development of such applications. These lenses and personas informed two prototypes, which we evaluated in driving simulator studies. Our results indicate that the gamified conditions increased driver engagement and reduced driving speeds. As such, our work contributes towards the design of engaging applications that are both appropriate to the safety-critical driving context and compelling to users.},

After the game was launched globally in July 2016, it quickly became the most successful mobile game in both popularity and revenue generation at the time, and the first location-based augmented reality game to reach a mainstream status. We explore the game experiences through a qualitative survey (n=1000) in Finland focusing on the positive and the negative aspects of Pokémon GO as told by the players. The positive experiences are related to movement, sociability, game mechanics, and brand while the negative experiences emerge from technical problems, unequal gaming opportunities, bad behavior of other players and non-players, and unpolished game design. Interestingly, the augmented reality features, safety issues or the free-to-play revenue model did not receive considerable feedback. The findings are useful for academics and industry practitioners for studying and designing location-based augmented reality game experiences.},

This paper presents two studies to inform the design of a new web browser with support for semi-automatic generation of cross-device interfaces. Based on the results of a recent study in which users manually customized web pages for cross-device use, our first study elicits from users how they might want to trigger popular cross-device patterns to transform single-device designs with relatively little effort. Our second study then examines how the emerging design patterns could be applied to the Alexa top 50 sites from 10 different genres. Based on these studies, we design semi-automatic techniques for page segmentation and distribution between multiple devices that can work on many existing web sites and require only minimal user input to switch between different cross-device designs. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to the Chrome web browser to make the techniques available for a wide range of desktop, mobile, and wearable devices, and successfully test them on popular web sites.},

This year it was held in Denver, bordering the beautiful Rocky Mountain region in the U.S., and reflected in our logo. The CHI 2017 conference began with two days of workshops and symposia, followed by four days of a technical program with 17 parallel sessions of provocative papers, panels, case studies, SIGs (Special Interest Groups), courses, and the popular student research, design, and game competitions. The growing alt.chi forum, now in its twelfth year, presented stimulating new ideas in HCI. The Interactivity forum showcased cutting-edge technology. For its second year, the CHI Art Exhibit merged art and technology in fascinating ways. This innovative work can be found in the Proceedings and Extended Abstracts, archived in the ACM Digital Library. For papers, the conference received 2400 submissions which were rigorously reviewed, resulting in 600 accepted papers. To ensure a better fit with reviewers, new subcommittees were created. Across all tracks, CHI received nearly 5000 submissions and accepted over 1000. Our conference theme this year, Explore, Innovate, Inspire, informed our planning process. A new venue held this year was CHI Stories. We generally know little of the personalities that drive the research presented at CHI. CHI Stories is a chance for CHI community members to share personal stories of inspiration, challenge, successes and failures, and grit. We also focused on inclusion this year. Hundreds of CHI attendees volunteered their skills in a Day of Service partnering with non-profit organizations. Inclusion was also manifest throughout the conference, for example, in the Diversity and Inclusion Lunch and by using telepresence robots to enable people with disabilities to participate remotely in the conference. Our keynote speakers were chosen to reflect our conference theme. The speakers were Neri Oxman, who combines computational design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology; Ben Shneiderman a founder of the CHI conference who, along with some key CHI personalities, gave a perspective on CHI's history and future; Wael Ghonim, credited with starting the Arab Spring and nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize; and best-selling author Nicholas Carr who challenges us to examine the unforeseen impacts of technology, particularly with automation. The world has experienced a dramatic change this past year. We live in extraordinary times and this calls for extraordinary thinking, something that the CHI community excels at. One of the challenges the community faced this year was responding to a U.S. executive order to ban citizens of certain countries from entering the country to attend CHI. As CHI is committed to inclusion, we decided to hold events at the conference to discuss and plan how we can continue our commitment to inclusion. The conference held a panel to discuss impacts of current political events on science, and hastily organized a panel to promote a conversation of civil liberties in science and a SIG on how the CHI community can participate in change. We are proud to have expanded telepresence options through the use of robots to enable people to participate in the conference remotely if they were physically unable to enter the country. We had a keynote speaker who inspired us on the topic of Internet activism. Our art exhibit, I'll Be Watching You, examined the contemporary issue of surveillance.},

These studies show that data scientists frequently code new analysis ideas by building off of their code from a previous idea. They often rely on informal versioning interactions like copying code, keeping unused code, and commenting out code to repurpose older analysis code while attempting to keep those older analyses intact. Unlike conventional version control, these informal practices allow for fast versioning of any size code snippet, and quick comparisons by interchanging which versions are run. However, data scientists must maintain a strong mental map of their code in order to distinguish versions, leading to errors and confusion. We explore the needs for improving version control tools for exploratory tasks, and demonstrate a tool for lightweight local versioning, called Variolite, which programmers found usable and desirable in a preliminary usability study.},

However, recent experiments have shown that even moderate difficulty can reduce player engagement. The present work investigates other design factors that may account for the purported benefits of difficulty, such as choice, novelty and suspense. These factors were manipulated in three design experiments involving over 20,000 play sessions of an online educational game. The first experiment (n=10,472) randomly assigned some players to a particular level of difficulty but allowed other players to freely choose their difficulty. Moderately difficult levels were most motivating when self-selected; yet, when difficulty was blindly assigned, the easiest games were most motivating. The second experiment (n=5,065) randomly assigned players to differing degrees of novelty. Moderate novelty was optimal, while too much or too little novelty reduced intrinsic motivation. A final experiment (n=6,511) investigated the role of suspense in "close games", where it was found to be beneficial. If difficulty decreases motivation while novelty and suspense increase it, then an implication for educational game designers is to make easy, interesting games that are "not too hard, not too boring."},

 abstract = {Research on sexism in digital games has suggested that women self-select out of playing sexist games; however, assuming a homogenous gender-based response does not account for the diversity of identities within a gender group. Gender-incongruent responses to recent events like #gamergate implies that the gender of the participant is not paramount to experience, but that their beliefs about gender roles are. To explore the role of sexist beliefs on experience in sexist games, we created three versions of a game that were identical except for the presence of sexist imagery and/or dialogue. We show that enjoyment of sexist games is not predicted by player gender, but by the player's pre-existing beliefs about gender. Furthermore, avatar identification is the pathway through which enjoyment is facilitated. Finally, sexist dialogue does not improve the play experience for anyone rather it harms experience for players of all genders who do not hold sexist beliefs.},

A challenge in prior work has been ensuring users can discern different thermal signals. We present an improved technique for thermal feedback that uses an array of three thermal stimulators. We demonstrate that the Thermal Array Display (TAD) increases users' ability to identify temperatures within a narrower range, compared to using a single thermal stimulator. While text messages dominate valence in the absence of context for temperature, the TAD consistently conveys arousal, and can enhance arousal of text messages, especially those that are emotionally neutral. We discuss potential applications of augmenting text with temperature.},

It allows people to choose a source of future coffee beans, situating their choices within the pool of decisions previously made. In doing so, it attempts to engage them in the transactions that are required to produce coffee. Initial studies of BitBarista with 42 participants reveal challenges of designing for connected systems, particularly in terms of perceptions of data gathering and sharing, as well as assumptions generated by current models of consumption. A discussion is followed by a series of suggestions for increasing positive attitudes towards data use in interactive systems.},

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of this security practice based on the password reset email that LinkedIn sent out around May 2016, and through an online survey conducted on 249 LinkedIn users who received that email. Our evaluation shows that only about 46% of the participants reset their passwords. The mean time taken to reset password was 26.3 days, revealing that a significant proportion of the participants reset their password a few weeks, or even months after first receiving the email. Our findings suggest that more effective persuasive measures need to be added to convince users to reset their password in a timely manner, and further reduce the risks associated with delaying password resets.},

In other words, should the app help viewers better follow what they are watching on TV, or offer additional enriching content to respond to interest created by the show? We developed a companion app for a documentary with both synoptic and supplementary content. A laboratory study with 28 participants examined the effect of these different types of content on the experience of using the companion and the effect on engagement with the show in terms of participants' recall. Engagement with the show was not affected by supplementary content in the app but coordinated viewing of both screens was more difficult. Design guidelines evident from these results are discussed.},

A significant decrease in cost of projection technology and advances in pico-sized projectors have spurred applications of Projective Augmented Reality. This research has focused mainly on technological development. However, there is still a need to fully understand its communicational and expressive potential. Hence, we define a conceptual paradigm that we call World-as-Support (WaS). We compare the WaS and WoW paradigms by contrasting their assumptions and cultural values, as well as through a study of an application aimed at supporting the collaborative improvisation of site-specific narratives by children. Our analysis of children's understanding of the physical and social environment and of their imaginative play allowed us to identify the affordances, strengths and weaknesses of these two paradigms.},

 abstract = {While many popular casual games use three-star systems, which give players up to three stars based on their performance in a level, this technique has seen limited application in human computation games (HCGs). This gives rise to the question of what impact, if any, a three-star system will have on the behavior of players in HCGs. In this work, we examined the impact of a three-star system implemented in the protein folding HCG Foldit. We compared the basic game's introductory levels with two versions using a three-star system, where players were rewarded with more stars for completing levels in fewer moves. In one version, players could continue playing levels for as many moves as they liked, and in the other, players were forced to reset the level if they used more moves than required to achieve at least one star on the level. We observed that the three-star system encouraged players to use fewer moves, take more time per move, and replay completed levels more often. We did not observe an impact on retention. This indicates that three-star systems may be useful for re-enforcing concepts introduced by HCG levels, or as a flexible means to encourage desired behaviors.},

To mitigate the drawbacks of these two status quo approaches, we created GazeSpeak, an eye gesture communication system that runs on a smartphone, and is designed to be low-cost, robust, portable, and easy-to-learn, with a higher communication bandwidth than an e-tran board. GazeSpeak can interpret eye gestures in real time, decode these gestures into predicted utterances, and facilitate communication, with different user interfaces for speakers and interpreters. Our evaluations demonstrate that GazeSpeak is robust, has good user satisfaction, and provides a speed improvement with respect to an e-tran board; we also identify avenues for further improvement to low-cost, low-effort gaze-based communication technologies.},

We analyze the HCI literature in order to reveal the impact of one particular theory, the trajectories framework that has been cited as an example of both contemporary HCI theory and a strong concept that sits between theory and design practice. Our analysis of 60 papers that seriously engaged with trajectories reveals the purposes that the framework served and which parts of it they used. We compare our findings to the originally stated goals of trajectories and to subsequent claims of its status as both theory and strong concept. The results shed new light on what we mean by theory in HCI, including its relationship to practice and to other disciplines.},

 abstract = {Appropriate challenges and challenge-skill balance are usually key to positive player experiences. However, some games such as the successful series Dark Souls are notorious for their excessive difficulty. Yet, there has been little empirical investigation of why players enjoy games they constantly struggle and fail with. We surveyed 95 participants right after the release of Dark Souls III about their experiences with the game, employing both open questions and different player experience measures. Players generally enjoyed challenging play sessions and mostly reported positive experiences, with achievement and learning moments strongly contributing to positive experiences. However, these factors themselves were enabled by negative events such as difficulties and avatar death. Our findings showcase that negative events bear a potential for forming positive and meaningful experiences, thus expanding previous knowledge about the role of challenge and failing in games. Moreover, the significance of hard-earned achievements extends present design conventions.},
