 abstract = {Hearing Instruments (HIs) have emerged as true body area networks, so called HI-BANs. Besides streaming audio data they connect wirelessly to accessories such as remote controls and Bluetooth devices. Multimodal sensor data from a HI-BAN is a way to adapt the HI behavior to the user's current hearing situation. As a potential future HI-BAN component we investigate bilateral vibrotactile feedback to support localization of sound sources. As a foundation for integrating vibrotactile cues we investigate which kind of feedback and vibration patterns are most suitable. We implemented two approaches for encoding lateral target angles: Continuous Guidance Feedback (CGF) and 6 variants with evolving complexity of Quantized Absolute Heading (QAH). In a user study with 16 normal hearing participants (7 m, 9 f, age 23--61) we evaluate lateralization error and user response time. For QAH results show a trade off between the minimal quantization error due to the encoding and the number of user errors due to misinterpretation of presented patterns. Moreover, results show a trade off between response time and minimum lateralization error. Choosing the most suitable bilateral vibrotactile encoding schemes is application-specific: For QAH a minimal average lateralization error of 27° (σ = 22°) was achieved with eight 45°-segments and an average user response time of 1600 ms (σ = 545 ms). A minimal average user response time of 900 ms (σ = 325 ms) was achieved with four 45°-segments and an average lateralization error of 43° (σ = 29°). CGF guides the user within a given tolerance margin to the target at the cost of higher response time. We find that for complex encoding schemes the overall performance is person-specific.},

 abstract = {Fitness advancement has been shown to be one of the most effective interventions against disease and critical to the promotion of general health and wellness. At the same time, fitness evaluation and development of appropriate intervention techniques traditionally requires participation of experienced trainers or physician, expensive equipment and dedicated instrumented exercise facilities. Furthermore, while critically important in maintenance of health, fitness evaluation is not available to most individuals due to cost and facility access. This paper presents StepFit - the first of its kind automated low cost system for fitness evaluation and promotion. The system consists of heart rate and motion sensors, and a computation platform for data aggregation, processing and subject feedback. StepFit automates well known and well validated fitness evaluation protocols, referred to as step tests, by capturing the measurements of the heart rate for fitness evaluation, and motion for ensuring that the exercise intensity is maintained according to the required protocol. The system provides guidance, determines test completion and provides assurance of protocol compliance. Finally, StepFit provides feedback in the form of fitness evaluation based on the acquired data and standard validated models, while at the same time archiving the model relating heart rate response of the individual to the selected step test. The heart rate model is based on clinically validated protocols and is used for physiological response analysis and prediction. This paper presents a successful proof of concept validation of StepFit in evaluation of fitness for multiple subjects and demonstrates applicability to a broad class of related assessment protocols as well as support by many mobile platform choices.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the performance of a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for an Impulse Radio Ultra Wide Band (IR-UWB) based Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). Unlike conventional UWB wireless schemes, the proposed UWB based WBAN uses UWB pulses for transmission and a narrowband signal for receiving at the sensor node to achieve a low-power network. To investigate the performance of the UWB-WBAN system in a large environment like hospitals, two network topologies have been considered. One topology uses a router as an intermediate node to collect vital physiological information collected by on-body sensor nodes. In the second scenario, the sensors directly transmit the collected data to a central control node. Binary Pulse Position Modulation (BPPM) is used as the modulation scheme for UWB transmission and Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) is used for narrow band transmission. Another unique feature in the proposed WBAN network is that the sensor nodes utilize multiple pulses per bit during UWB transmission. Number of pulses sent per bit are dynamically varied according to received bit error rate and used to optimize wireless transmission, thus providing low-power consumption.},

 abstract = {Body posture detection is extremely useful in health monitoring and rehabilitation. We develop a method to detect body posture that uses signal strength measurements from sensor nodes forming a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). We assume that postures (formations) take values in a discrete set and develop a composite hypothesis testing approach which uses a Generalized Likelihood Test (GLT) decision rule. The GLT rule distinguishes between a set of probability density function (pdf) families constructed using a custom pdf interpolation technique. The GLT is compared with the simple Likelihood Test (LT). We also adapt one prevalent supervised learning approach, Multiple Support Vector Machine (MSVM), to compare with our probabilistic methods. Due to the highly variant measurements from the WBAN, and these methods' different adaptability to multiple observations, our analysis and experimental results suggest that GLT is more accurate and suitable for posture/formation detection. Even for very similar postures in our experiments, GLT demonstrates high detection accuracy (around 97% with multiple observations). Besides the body area networks, the formation detection problem has interesting applications in autonomous robot systems.},

With mobile phones (one of the mostly used modules in body area networks) this information is potentially available to a host of applications and can enable richer, more appropriate, and more satisfying human-computer interaction. In this paper we describe the AMMON (Affective and Mental health MONitor) library, a low footprint C library designed for widely available phones as an enabler of these applications. The library incorporates both core features for emotion recognition (from the Interspeech 2009 Emotion recognition challenge), and the most important features for mental health analysis (glottal timing features). To comfortably run the library on feature phones (the most widely-used class of phones today), we implemented the routines in fixed-point arithmetic, and minimized computational and memory footprint. On identical test data, emotion and stress classification accuracy was indistinguishable from a state-of-the-art reference system running on a PC, achieving 75% accuracy on two-class emotion classification tasks and 84% accuracy on binary classification of stressed and neutral situations. The library uses 30% of real-time on a 1GHz processor during emotion recognition and 70% during stress and mental health analysis.},

By choosing a particular use case, we demonstrate how we can exploit disparities inherent in a typical implanted BAN to enable ultra low power operation which also meets other (often) competing requirements. We present a new MAC scheme, which allows ultra low power operation by handling the nodes in accordance to their power and latency requirements. We present a new scheme for deriving analytically the power-optimised TDMA frame parameters like beacon interval and discuss solutions to manage synchronisation overhead. Equations for deriving the duty-cycling efficiency are presented and the packet error rate is calculated for the in-body wireless channel. Our results and simulations show that the protocol outperforms best of reported MACs and for low data rate sensors (typical of BAN) our MAC allows close to standby limit power consumption.},

 abstract = {Human activity recognition is important for many applications. This paper describes a human activity recognition framework based on feature selection techniques. The objective is to identify the most important features to recognize human activities. We first design a set of new features (called physical features) based on the physical parameters of human motion to augment the commonly used statistical features. To systematically analyze the impact of the physical features on the performance of the recognition system, a single-layer feature selection framework is developed. Experimental results indicate that physical features are always among the top features selected by different feature selection methods and the recognition accuracy is generally improved to 90%, or 8% better than when only statistical features are used. Moreover, we show that the performance is further improved by 3.8% by extending the single-layer framework to a multi-layer framework which takes advantage of the inherent structure of human activities and performs feature selection and classification in a hierarchical manner.},

 abstract = {We present a system that recognizes human activities during trauma resuscitation, the fast-paced and team-based initial management of injured patients in the emergency department. Most objects used in trauma resuscitation are uniquely associated with tasks. To detect object use, we employed passive radio frequency identification (RFID) for their size and cost advantages. We designed the system setup to ensure the effectiveness of passive tags in such a complex setting, which includes various objects and significant human motion. Through our studies conducted at a Level 1 trauma center, we learned that objects used in trauma resuscitation need to be tagged differently because of their size, shape, and material composition. Based on this insight, we classified the medical items into groups based on usage and other characteristics. Objects in different groups are tagged differently and their data is processed differently. We applied machine-learning algorithms to identify object-state changes and process the RFID data using algorithms specific to object groups. Our results show that RFID has significant potential for automatic detection of object usage in complex and fast-paced settings.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new technology, which allows people to share taste and smell sensations digitally with a remote person through existing networking technologies such as the Internet. By introducing this technology, we expect people to share their smell and taste experiences with their family and friends remotely. Sharing these senses are immensely beneficial since those are strongly associated with individual memories, emotions, and everyday experiences. As the initial step, we developed a control system, an actuator, which could digitally stimulate the sense of taste remotely. The system uses two approaches to stimulate taste sensations digitally: the electrical and thermal stimulations on tongue. Primary results suggested that sourness and saltiness are the main sensations that could be evoked through this device. Furthermore, this paper focuses on future aspects of such technology for remote smell actuation followed by applications and possibilities for further developments.},

Today people are willing to pay more attention to their health situation. More medical services are in need and exceed the potentials of this hospital-centric service model. Using advanced biomedical sensors, the body condition of patients and aging persons can be monitored at home. Through wireless communication, their doctors and families can monitor their body condition in real time remotely and take suitable treatment and clinical care. It is estimates that more than 200 million people in the EU and the US suffer from one or several diseases where mobile health monitoring can become a treatment option. In that case, they don't need to visit the hospital regularly, which saves a lot of time and money. Meanwhile, as continuous monitoring can discover symptoms earlier, it helps preventing the disease from growing severely. Therefore, mobile monitoring and remote healthcare can significantly improve people's life quality, especially for chronic patient and aging people.},

An investigation on the effects of the body in the communication link is done, based on measurements, for a range of body postures and on-body links. Return reflection loss results show that, on average, the antenna performance is 0.6 dB worse than in free space, also presenting a small detuning (<5 MHz). A fitting to the Normal Distribution is proven to be acceptable. Up to 33 dB of dispersion of values is verified for path links with the same length, as a consequence of antenna mismatch, which can turn a quasi-line-of-sight link into a non-line-of-sight one, increasing path loss up to 15 dB.},

 abstract = {Anomaly detection, for uncovering faults and failures, is a crucial task for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). There have been substantive research efforts in this field such as source-level troubleshooting, rule-based inference, and time sequence event analysis. Most existing approaches, however, rely on the collection of a large amount of information. Due to the lack of management on information features, the redundancy of collected information greatly degrades the efficiency of diagnosis in large-scale WSNs. To address this issue, we propose RFS (<u>R</u>anking-based <u>F</u>eature <u>S</u>election), a three-stage approach to efficiently select representative feature sets for diagnostic tasks and effectively characterize the network status. RFS is a compatible component that can be integrated with most state-of-the-art diagnosis approaches. We conduct extensive experiments based on a large-scale outdoor WSN system, GreenOrbs, to examine the performance of RFS. The results demonstrate that RFS achieves effective anomaly detection in a large-scale WSN with low overhead.},

Acoustic ambiguities limit the set of daily life situations where HIs can support the user adequately. State-of-the-art HIs feature body area networking capabilities. Thus, body-worn sensors could be used to recognize complex user contexts and enhance next-generation HIs. In this work, we identify in a rich real-world data set the mapping between the context of the user --which can be recognized from bodyworn sensors-- and the user's current hearing wish. This is the foundation for the implementation of recognition systems for the specific cues in next generation HIs based on on-body sensor data. We discuss how the identified mapping allows selecting a-priori distributions for hearing wishes and HI parameters like the switching sensitivity. We conclude deducing the sensory requirements to realize next generation of networked HIs.},
