A previous proposed intra-vaginal sensor acquires temperature values and sends the collected data to Android device over a Bluetooth connection. The Android tool allows women for real-time monitoring of their temperature with mobility support and following their daily life. Woman can control and detect their fertile and ovulation periods when this human parameter increases about 0.5°C over their regular temperature.

 abstract = {Because of the various application scenarios and use cases they make possible, Body Area Networks (BAN) have been investigated during the recent years by many academic and industrial communities. Among various technologies, Ultra Wide Band (UWB) was considered to be a good candidate for a physical layer in a BAN. Many propagation measurements have been conducted to study the wave propagation around the human body, and then design channel models. Our work aims at evaluating a UWB-Impulse Radio (IR) physical layer for BAN. This physical layer is based on Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) and Binary Pulse Position Modulation (BPPM) modulations and it relies on the last IEEE 802.15.6 BAN channel models. This analysis presents the Bit or Symbol Error Rate (BER or SER) as a function of the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Computer simulations are conducted using IEEE 802.15.6 BAN channel models, and the system performances are investigated under coherent and noncoherent receivers.},

 abstract = {Body Area Networks are unique in that the large-scale mobility of users allows the network itself to travel across a diverse range of operating domains or even to enter new and unknown environments. This network mobility is unlike node mobility in that sensed changes in inter-network interference level may be used to identify opportunities for intelligent inter-networking, for example, by merging or splitting from other networks, thus providing an extra degree of freedom. This paper introduces the concept of context-aware bodynets for interactive environments using inter-network interference sensing. New ideas are explored at both the physical and link layers with an investigation based on a 'smart' office environment. A series of carefully controlled measurements of the mesh interconnectivity both within and between an ambulatory body area network and a stationary desk-based network were performed using 2.45 GHz nodes. Received signal strength and carrier to interference ratio time series for selected node to node links are presented. The results provide an insight into the potential interference between the mobile and static networks and highlight the possibility for automatic identification of network merging and splitting opportunities.},

In this paper, we describe a framework which provides a way to access not only the data, but also the processing capabilities of a sensor system in a reusable way, without the need for a-priori knowledge about the availability of sensors in the environment. In particular, the presented framework is able to run on an embedded system platform, and is used for the recognition of human activities in a body sensor network. Notably, both the feature extraction and classification are performed within the network. Hence, we can use the processing power of sensor nodes, and do not have to revert to the processing capabilities of a client device which is using the sensor network. Two experiments have been conducted to show the feasibility and performance of our approach in typical activity recognition scenarios.},

Existing techniques rely on off-line, laboratory-based analysis, as well as on outfitting the bike with various sensors and transducers that give an estimate of the performance during training and racing. We propose a radically different approach, with the aim of determining the actual status of the cyclist's body in real-time and real-life conditions. Our solution is based on body area wireless motion sensor nodes that can collaboratively process the sensory information and give immediate feedback to the cyclists. We study experimentally the accuracy of such a system with respect to the gold standard camera system. The biomechanics measures of interest are the knee and ankle angles of the cyclists, which give an indication of the correctness and efficiency of the cycling technique. The results obtained from a series of experiments with nine subjects show the accuracy of the motion sensor system compared with the reference given by the camera system. Furthermore, we analyse the wireless characteristics of our system, the energy expenditure and possible improvements.},

This work characterizes and addresses errors related to sensor and mounting calibration and node synchronization on a case study application -- knee joint angle as measured during walking by an accelerometer- and gyroscope-based BSN.

For this objective, we address in this article the issue of aorta diameter estimation. The problem studied consist in estimating the radius of a slowly time-varying cylinder, the aorta, in a dispersive, lossy tissue with frequency-dependent attenuation. It is assumed blood pressure may be calculated based on the radius as a function of time. Signals are generated using an FDTD electromagnetic wave simulator with a simplified geometry. We have considered three candidate estimators: an impulse radar based on a matched filter, an FMCW radar and a least squares problem using a channel model inspired by the ideal cylinder response. All estimators use a propagation model to compensate for propagation effects. To achieve a relative precision of 0.1 mm, a ratio between emitter energy and receiver noise spectral density above 110 dB to 130 dB, depending on estimator, was found sufficient. Furthermore, precision for all estimators was best at lower frequencies in the range we investigated, between 1 GHz and 3 GHz. Although linearity was generally good, due to very small delay variations over the expected 1.1 ± 0.22 mm peak-to-peak variation of aorta radius, non-linear effects is difficult to avoid, especially at the lowest frequencies. Offsets were also present depending on estimator.},

We investigate how to minimize tactor power consumption by tuning the characteristics of their excitatory signal and present an activation policy to maximize the number of tactors that can be simultaneously powered by a battery under a tight peak current constraint. The proposed optimizations reduce power consumption and allow a much higher number of simultaneously active tactors.

These systems pave the way for acquisition of quality data relevant for research studies or clinical practice in a healthcare domain carried out outside of the controlled laboratory environments. To date, there exists a number of such systems, however, neither the systems themselves nor details on their features are easily accessible by healthcare practitioners interested in their use for research or regular practice. This paper presents the results of our initial survey on the state-of-the-art in off-the-shelf wearable Body Area Network (BAN) systems for ambulatory psychophysiological measurements and their features. We first present a high-level overview and definition of such a BAN for healthcare use. We provide a detailed discussion on its relevant features and the issues influencing the system performance and usability, including: sensor specifications, system wearability, communication characteristics, battery lifetime, and so on. We expand this discussion towards a set of off-the-shelf BANs. Finally, we highlight some of the design challenges and open issues that still need to be addressed to make such systems effective for a wide range of applications, e.g., we review state-of-the-art for energy-efficient MAC protocols. This paper aims to provide knowledge to those interested in ambulatory measurements, on the set of available systems and their capabilities, and to highlight opportunities for practitioners or scientists in a healthcare domain, and to encourage them to reflect upon their system requirements.},

Movement of on-body sensors, low quality and time-variant wireless links, and the demand for a reliable and fast data transmission at low energy cost are some challenging issues in WBANs. Using ultra low power wireless transceivers to reduce power consumption causes a limited transmission range. This implies that a multi-hop protocol is a promising design choice. This paper proposes a multi-hop protocol for human body health monitoring. The protocol is robust against frequent changes of the network topology due to posture changes, and variation of wireless link quality.

The use of these sensors for medical purposes offers valuable contributions to improve patients' healthcare, both for diagnosis and therapeutics monitoring. An important and common parameter used on healthcare diagnosis is the body temperature. It is monitored on several matters related with gynecological and obstetrics issues but, usually it is measure at the skin surface. Then, this paper proposes the design concepts of a new intra-body sensor for long-term intra-vaginal temperature collection. The embedded IEEE 802.15.4 communication module allows the integration of this sensor in wireless sensor networks for remote data access and monitoring. It is presented the sensor architecture, the construction of the corresponding testbed, and its performance evaluation.

Using our temporal BAN channel models we study trade-offs created by a mix of two MAC techniques: i) contention-based access, and ii) polling-based access. By using these techniques at different proportions we see how performance and energy consumption vary. The results reveal design trade-offs in the packet delivery vs. latency vs. consumed energy space. Moreover, we show how optimal points for packet delivery vary depending on the traffic. Finally, explaining the results offers important insight into the behaviour of these techniques under BAN conditions as well as more general issues with medium access for BAN. This insight translates to concrete design suggestions to build more efficient MAC protocols.},

 abstract = {With the rapid growth of elderly population, u-healthcare service combined with advanced wireless networking technology is gaining popularity. The in-body and on-body nodes have very stringent requirements on transmit power and battery life. Furthermore, the wireless link in an in-body environment has a very high degree of path loss (e.g., 6.2 for deep tissue). Because of such worse settings for each communication node to deliver data packets to the other node, it is preferred to have a multi-hop network topology. This will ensure that each node can deliver data packets at a reduced expense of consuming a low level of transmit power, which is attractive to the live body of patients receiving the healthcare service due to the reduced level of radiation effect. We study an efficient method to deliver delay-intolerant data packets over multiple hops. As a solution we consider multiple description coding (MDC) and develop a mathematical formulation for packet-level scheduling of delay-intolerant MDC packets over multiple hops. The proposed method can be used as a simple guideline for applications to setting up a topology for a medical body area network (BAN) of each individual patient.},

The systems have been tested in animal experiments and in patient trials. Both systems have proven their ability to deliver high quality measurements of the heart's motion and contraction, and to detect changes caused by occlusion of an artery. The ultrasound probes deliver very local information from where the transducer is fastened, while the accelerometer data seem to be more linked to global heart function. The ultrasound system requires high data rates and heavy processing, but the processed results are straightforward to interpret. For the accelerometer, the required data transfer rates and processing power is quite low. The optimal processing scheme for the accelerometer recordings is not so straightforward, but different schemes have been tested with promising results. The two systems are integrated with ECG and pressure measurements to a "multi-sensor system for the heart".},

An automatic method of model selection is proposed to construct models for high sample rate data by grouping sets of predictor variables. The grouped predictor variable model optimization problem is formalized. Once an initial regression is performed on all available variables, our approximate algorithm for finding the grouped variable model with the greatest validity runs in O(n2) time, where n is the number of available predictor variables. This is compared to the all subsets technique which requires O(2n) time for the same predictor set.

In modern telemedicine it is desirable that implant cardiac devices such as pacemakers can be interrogated and reprogrammed remotely. Such functions require a reliable wireless communication channel between the implant device and an external control unit. In order to increase the longevity of the implant device, the communication link must consume extremely low power. The use of ultra wideband (UWB) signals for this wireless link can fulfill the above requirements. However, little is known about the propagation of UWB signals inside the human body, despite the enormous research effort that has recently been devoted to the characterization of the on-body UWB radio communication channel. This paper presents a propagation model of UWB signals through the human chest in the 1--6 GHz frequency band. This is based on numerical simulations using a heterogeneous anatomical model with frequency dependent tissue material properties. The provided model is suitable for the design of UWB in-body communication links for wireless cardiac monitoring devices.},

Cooperative transmission is an efficient technique to enhance the transmission reliability and maintain a low transmission power. In the proposed cooperation scheme, a mobile device acts as the relay of the network and help the sensors to forward the data it has received. Rake receiver for Ultra WideBand (UWB) receiving and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) method are employed to deal with the multipath reflections of BAN channel. The power allocation between the sensor and the mobile device is optimized to enhance the transmission reliability. The simulation result shows that the proposed cooperative transmission scheme can significantly reduce the Bit Error Rate (BER) and prolong the system lifetime, compared to the non-cooperative scheme.

 abstract = {Electrocardiography (ECG) is a widely accepted approach for monitoring of cardiac activity and clinical diagnosis of heart diseases. In order to make ECG systems portable, easy to setup, comfortable to patients and tolerant of artifacts, wireless single-pad ECG systems have been developed. To tackle the problems raised by wireless single-pad ECG systems, we propose an upgraded version, the wireless three-pad ECG system (W3ECG). W3ECG furthers the pad design idea of the single-pad approach. We add two more pads to the W3ECG to gain spatial variety of heart activity. Signals obtained from these three pads, plus their placement information, make it possible to synthesize conventional 12-lead ECG signals. We provide one example of pad placement and evaluate its performance by examining ECG data of four patients available from online database. Feasibility test of our selected pad placement positions show comparable results with respect to the EASI lead system. Experimental results also exhibit high correlations between synthesized and directly observed 12-lead signals (9 out of 12 cross-correlation coefficients higher than 0.75).},

 abstract = {In the Biomedical Wireless Sensor Network (BWSN) project a consortium of Scandinavian research institutions, technology startup companies, sensor producers, software companies and a hospital based clinical test facility collaborated for 36 months. A portfolio of multiple, experimental wireless sensor prototypes were implemented in sophisticated process control software modified for the project. The project objective was to facilitate real time and historical point-of-care sensor data for clinical decision support and monitoring in hemodynamic treatment. The wireless communication platform and results from clinical tests are presented in this paper. The radio frequency platform used in the project was operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Personal Area Network standard. Invasive sensors included a non-disposable blood pressure sensor, an epicardial 3- axis accelerometer and a digital pulmonary air leakage system. Non-invasive sensor signals came from an ECG sensor, a pulse oximeter, a medical radar and a temperature sensor. Point-to-point transmission of radio frequency signals from sensors to base stations and onwards in the biomedical wireless sensor network (BWSN) architecture was scrutinized during experimental surgery. A qualitative assessment of the sensor data presentation was made. Occurrence of shadowing effects influencing the radio frequency channel performance was quantified. The shadowing effects were caused by the dynamic work pattern of the clinical team in combination with stationary equipment in the operating room during surgery. The shadowing effects were not found to compromise the quality of the wireless sensor data. Shadowing parameters to reconstruct our measurements and model the communication links between individual sensors and two separate base stations are provided.},

 abstract = {Pattern recognition is becoming a key application in body-area networks. This paper presents a framework promoting unsupervised training for multi-modal, multi-sensor classification systems. Specifically, it enables sensors provided with pattern-recognition capabilities to autonomously supervise the learning process of other sensors. The approach is discussed using a case study combining a smart camera and a body-worn accelerometer. The body-worn accelerometer sensor is trained to recognize four user activities pairing accelerometer data with labels coming from the camera. Experimental results illustrate the applicability of the approach in different conditions.},
