 abstract = {This paper presents a novel planar Ultra Wideband (UWB) dipole antenna for UWB Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications and the investigations of antenna polarization properties. The presented UWB antenna is designed to cover the UWB frequency band of 3.1--10.6 GHz while targeted to be exploited in the link between WBAN on-body and off-body communications in UWB WBAN systems. First, the properties of a single antenna are investigated by simulations in terms of current distributions, Axial Ratio (AR), and tilt angle τ of a polarization ellipse following by the Polarization Loss Factor (PLF) study with two antennas in different use cases. Results are compared with that observed in free space. Based on the simulations and calculations, the body has notable effect on the polarization loss. The shape of current distributions and AR varied significantly in the investigated use positions. The antenna position on the body was further observed to be sensitive to the achieved results. We hope this paper increases general understanding about the effect of body on the antenna properties and further to the channel performance.},

The miniature in-body sensors are often restricted in physical size and have limited power supply. At the same time, wireless transmission must also cope with large attenuation due to body tissues and organs. Applications such as the capsule endoscope, require high data rates in order to transmit colour video from inside the small intestine. For such applications, ultra wideband (UWB) communication with pulse-position modulation (PPM) is a suitable solution. In this paper we present a complete communication chain for a capsule endoscope with PPM for transmission over multipath channels.

In this context, we propose a solution to localize wearable wireless nodes relatively to a body-strapped Local Coordinate System (LCS). More particularly, we consider adapting a Constrained Distributed Weighted Multi-Dimensional Scaling algorithm (CDWMDS) that asynchronously estimates nodes' locations under fixed-length constraints. This algorithm is fed by inter-node range measurements based on e.g. Impulse Radio - Ultra Wideband (IR-UWB) Time Of Arrival (TOA) estimation. Several new enhancements to the nominal CDWMDS, including nodes censoring and updates scheduling for nodes' locations, are herein put forward to mitigate errors propagation and harmful effects caused by fast moving nodes. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the gains observed on the average location error per node under moderate pedestrian mobility, relying on a realistic biomechanical model.},

This paper studies the extent to which a person's sleep quality can be predicted by his/her daily context information. A combination of the machine learning technology and medical knowledge is used to study the relation between context and sleep quality, so that sleep quality can be predicted in real time according to the relation. We propose a novel sleep quality predicting framework from user context data, without requiring users to wear special devices. We develop a data collecting and analyzing prototype system called SleepMiner, which uses on-phone data such as mobile sensor data and communication data to extract human contexts. Then the relationship between context data and sleep quality is analyzed and a learning model based on factor graph model is proposed to predict sleep quality. From experimental results we demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer sleep quality (around 78%) from user context information. A set of solutions are proposed to address the practical problems of Android phone in data collection, making SleepMiner work with minimal impact on the phone's resources. We finally carry out experiments to evaluate our design in effectiveness and efficiency.},

The latter is compliant with one mandatory band imposed by the IEEE 802.15.6 standardization group.

The density parameters evolution is thus characterized as a function of the previous channel and SNR configurations, illustrating e.g. missed/false path detection effects under low SNR.

Accurate sensor placement with respect to anatomical landmarks is one of the main concerns in reliability of the motion capturing systems. Changes in position of sensors cause increased variability in motion data. Our goal is to isolate the characteristic features that represent the principle motion pattern. By using functional Principal Component Analysis (f-PCA) we compensate for the variation in data due to inadvertent movement of sensor placement. F-PCA is an effective tool for the study of human motion modeling by identifying hidden combinations and relationships between variables. The collected data from our experiment show differences between similar actions within different sessions of marker wearing.

 abstract = {Ultra wideband (UWB) radio signals have gained significant attention for emerging medical applications. Communication with medical implanted sensors and actuators, biomedical radar, microwave imaging, and microwave hyperthermia are some examples of said applications. All these diagnostic and therapeutic methods necessitate the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves toward or from the human body. In such scenarios, a segment of the wave propagation path is inside the human body and the other segment is outside, i.e., in the free-space. This geometry creates an impedance mismatch between the two propagation environments, which results in inefficient power transmission of the EM wave. In order to improve the EM wave coupling to/from the body, a matching layer of dielectric material with the appropriate permittivity value can be used. This paper analyzes the effect of a single layer of dielectric material on the propagation of a UWB wave through the human chest in the 100--1000 MHz frequency range. Path loss models for different matching layer materials were obtained and a guideline for selecting the appropriate permittivity value is presented.},

Body Area Networks (BAN), due to their reduced range, are by nature relatively low power, but as an answer to achieve even a more confined range, Near Field Communications (NFC) and Body Coupled Communications (BCC) have been proposed. While the first is used to link two devices that are physically very close, the BCC concept broadens the communication range to the region around the human body. One of the possible technologies supporting BCC is based upon relatively low frequency capacitive coupling between emitter and receiver. Understanding the connection between the physical layout of an electromagnetic system and its electrical model is important to understand its performance and critical aspects. However, although much information exists about antennas and their radiated energy, very few work has been done on how energy is transferred between the electrodes used in a capacitive communication system. In this paper we propose a simple model for estimating the gain of a capacitive coupling system. This model has been validated by 3D electromagnetic simulations and double checked with practical experiments performed in a controlled environment (faraday cage with only the minimum indispensable instrumentation equipment). The results are similar within an order of magnitude which, for the intended use of the model, proves to be accurate enough.},

Yet because of their limited processing and transmission capacities most applications considered to date imply either indoor real-time data streaming, or ambulatory data recording. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using disruption-tolerant wireless sensors to monitor the biomedical parameters of athletes during outdoor sports events. We focus on a scenario we believe to be a most challenging one: the ECG monitoring of runners during a marathon race, using off-the shelf sensing devices and a limited number of base stations deployed along the marathon route. Preliminary experiments conducted during an intra-campus sports event show that such a scenario is indeed viable, although special attention must be paid to supporting episodic, low-rate transmissions between sensors carried by runners and road-side base stations.},

The fuzzy feature can extract the hiding information from the pulse units. Pulse data preprocessing and fuzzy feature extraction only operates the wavelet transform coefficients of the original data. The algorithm complexity of the fuzzy feature extraction is about O(N). Through analyzing the clusters from 28 patients' pulse units, the fuzzy feature can extract the hiding information well.

Our study reveals the inherent resilience of popular algorithms in cardiac monitoring applications and argues that by exploiting the unique characteristics of such algorithms the energy efficiency and reliability of such systems can be significantly improved. This is achieved by developing a cross-layer design paradigm that utilizes low cost techniques at the hardware and software layers and by optimizing the synergy between them in order to provide intelligent trade-offs between energy, performance and quality. The main idea of the proposed approach is the selective application of costly robust techniques only to the most critical tasks identified at the application layer that are detrimental for obtaining sufficient output quality. Our results show that by ensuring the correct operation of only 37% of the total computations in an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring WBSN node we can achieve up to 70% power savings with only 9% degradation in ECG output quality.},

Energy detector (ED) receivers are considered as a low-complexity and a low-power consumption option for the more complex coherent receivers. Obviously, the tradeoff for low complexity is degraded detection performance. A challenge of the energy detector receiver is to define an optimized integration time and with OOK, defining the optimal energy threshold for the decision of the received bit. Here, we define these variables using two different wireless body area network (WBAN) channel models for comparison purposes: the IEEE 802.15.6 channel model 3 and a real, measured hospital channel model. Performance of the energy detector receiver with two different modulation methods, OOK and PPM, is then compared using the two aforementioned channel models.

 abstract = {Body sensor networks (BSNs) often operate in dynamic environments, with the collected data profiles---and the resulting importance of data---varying throughout the system runtime. Therefore, the potential for power reduction fluctuates with changing user behavior, creating a dynamic battery lifetime-fidelity relationship that is subject to variations throughout the battery lifetime corresponding to an individual's daily activities---past, present, and future. This paper explores the potential for optimizing the tradeoff between meeting a desired battery lifetime and maximizing system fidelity through run-time adaptation of sensor acquisition (duty cycling) and profile-based predictions of an individual's future activities. A "personal activity profile" describes the expected behavior of an individual and is used to inform the desired battery discharge characteristics over time. Using walking activity traces collected from three human subjects wearing Fitbit® trackers over several months in order to develop such activity profiles, the approach is demonstrated in simulation based based on an analytical power model for an inertial BSN platform incorporating recent sensors. Results show improvements over statically setting a duty cycle for constant power consumption with respect to ideally setting the duty cycle based upon a priori knowledge of activities of interest throughout the system lifetime.},

Low cost implementation and ubiquitous deployment calls for the use of license-exempt ISM bands, in which coexistence of other license-exempt devices, particular WiFi radios, negatively impacts on the robustness of BANs.

 abstract = {Recently, many research studies and development projects focus on wearable sensor systems for applications such as human activity recognition or monitoring, biomedical clothing, health monitoring and medical care. In general, this kind of wearable system should be small-sized, lightweight, low-power, comfortable and non-invasive for the user. In this study, we present a prototype of electrocardiogram (ECG) and physical activity monitoring system using a low-power consumption 315 MHz RF transceiver module and stretchable wiring used to increase the snugness of the system. Currently, most of the wearable systems use Bluetooth or ZigBee as the wireless interface. In general, when Bluetooth or ZigBee are active, they consume more than 15 mA current during RF communication. Since the battery is the main power source for these kinds of wearable systems, reducing the power consumption during RF communication can significantly increase the battery lifetime. Therefore, the authors have realized a low-power consumption, small-sized and lightweight 315 MHz transceiver module powered by a 3.3 V supply voltage. The module consumes 1 mA and 2 mA for the transmission and receiving modes respectively. The entire system is composed of three blocks - the main block, RF block and the power block. The interconnection of each block is implemented with stretchable wiring to enhance the tensility and flexibility. Therefore, the user's comfort and mobility should be improved. Without the antenna, the system can be fabricated with an area of 110 x 30 mm2. The main block is comprised of an ECG amplifier circuit, a 3-axes accelerometer, an altimeter sensor, a humidity sensor, a temperature sensor and an 8051 MCU. The low-power 315 MHz transceiver module is equipped in the RF block. The power block is composed of a typical coin-sized rechargeable lithium-ion battery (3.7V, 75 mAh) and a regulator with charging circuit. The block diagram and image of the proposed system are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. The 8051 MCU is used to control the entire operation of the system. The ECG and accelerometer data are sampled at 125 Hz. The altimeter, humidity, temperature and battery voltage data are sampled at 8 Hz. The data are packed into a packet and transferred to the 315 MHz RF module using a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART). Then, the sensed information and ECG are displayed in graphical form on the PC in real time. During continuous transmission of the sensed information, the MCU, sensors and ECG circuitry are always active. Under this condition, the entire system only consumes 15.5 mA of current. Thus, for a 75 mAh battery, the proposed system can operate for more than 4 hours. In the future, further reduction of current consumption can be achieved through reduction of the wireless communication period, putting the MCU, RF module and sensors in standby mode, and decreasing the frequency of MCU clock.},

A WBAN comprises a number of intelligent biosensors and actuators that may either be implanted in vivo or mounted on the surface of the human body, and that are capable of wireless communication to one or more external nodes that are in close proximity to the human body. In this paper, we propose a new and efficient feedforward error-control technology, Temporal Diversity Coding (TDC), to increase the robustness and reliability of Wireless Body Area networks. Temporal Diversity Coding applies Diversity Coding in time and space to improve the WBAN's performance. We demonstrate that by implementing this novel technique, we can achieve significant improvement (~50%) in throughput compared to extant WBANs.},

Possible WSN ambient surveillance in hospitals (which is of secondary importance) must consider the coexistence challenges with the wireless technologies that collect the medical data and minimize the impact towards the medical devices that operate in the same frequency band. To mitigate the interference problems WSNs may efficiently utilize the dynamic spectrum access techniques introduced by the cognitive radio (CR). This paper presents a proof-of-concept for CR enabled wireless sensor network deployed in medical surroundings. The proof-of-concept is performed on a Sun SPOT testbed platform. It demonstrates the WSNs ability to dynamically adjust the transmission parameters (i.e. frequency) thus minimizing the interference to the wireless systems of primary importance in the hospital environments.},

In this paper, we explore some of the hardware sensor interface challenges involved with condensing the fetal monitoring procedure into a portable system, specifically for a system integration with a smartphone. There are two contributions of our hardware interface with an Android-based smartphone: i) using IOIO hardware board to prototype an universal interface to commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hospital-graded medical devices, ii) using Google's Near Field Communication (NFC) Android devices for initiating our monitoring mobile application and secure interface hardware devices and a backend hospital information system (HIS). We demonstrated this prototype that could integrate with current existing medical monitoring devices and capture BSN information in a seamless manner without cumbersome initialization processes. Also, it reduced the risk that applications can accidentally be initialized and corrupted HIS unintentionally. As a result, the system can be potentially used by a remote monitoring setup without a presence of a medical profession, and even streamline in-patient monitoring process with actual precision for the medical measurements.},

 abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks present a pending challenge for a complete deployability due to energy requirements. The low power density that these energy sources provide compared to the required energy for the communication process creates the necessity of temporal storage. Unfortunately, the random nature of the energy sources implies that the energy storage unit might not be able to guarantee the communication at all time, thus giving a certain loss probability, which is a function of the energy storage capacity. Typical solutions reduce this loss probability by over-dimensioning the battery, producing a very large overhead in size. In this paper, a scalable energy model is presented for the estimation of the loss probability. Accordingly, this energy model is applied in order to provide battery dimensioning guidelines. The results show that, by means of an accurate energy model, a certain loss probability can be achieved, while reducing up to 4 times the needed energy storage capacity.},

 abstract = {Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) are the natural candidates to provide multi-parameter patient monitoring. Tapping into multiple inputs and correlating them to infer new information, cleaning received data and inferring state should be objectives of BSNs. These systems will need to deduce information from a variety of raw sensor data and accuracy in their results will be paramount. Apart from having several different types of sensors (producing different types of data), BSNs will also have several applications wanting to access information. Not all of the information will be directly sensed, but some can be inferred from the raw sensor data. We propose a framework that enables modularization of information and its correlation. This enables re-use by different applications and optimization of the collection and calculation of the requested information by the system (the BSN). The framework also allows defining dependencies between modules for information production. Our architecture provides an abstraction on the way information is assessed and its processing flow. Applications issue requests to the middleware with requirements to be met. So we will discuss the optimization of resources, while honouring requirements.},

The latter opportunistically exploits the body movements performed when the human subject is walking: transmissions are inhibited when no connectivity between transmitter and receiver is present and aggregated data is transmitted when visibility is gained. Results are achieved through experimental measurements made on the field, by implementing the proposed solution on the Texas Instruments CC2530 platform.

In the Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications, use of Ultra Wideband (UWB) transmission as well as close presence of human body, bring their own major challenges in the channel modeling. Several channel models have been proposed and numerous channel measurement campaigns have been performed for WBAN applications, but they are only approximations for certain situations. The main challenge in this field is to find a method to generate realistic channel models for new different purposes quickly and flexibly without excessive computational efforts. In this paper, applicability of Finite Integration Technique (FIT) is studied in the modeling the channel characteristics of WBAN on-off body communication link. The validity of the FIT-based channel modeling is verified by comparing the FIT simulation results with the measurement results using three different Ultra Wide Band (UWB) printed planar antennas. The analysis is performed both in frequency and time domains. It is shown that there is a clear agreement between the simulated and measured channel responses. Hence, FIT can be considered as a promising technique in the modeling of realistic on-off body communications channel characteristics for the cases where there is no analytical model available.},

 abstract = {Cognitive Radio (CR) is a fast growing technology domain, which is currently in the stage of transitioning from R&D; labs through international standardization committees and fora to the market. One particular promising application domain for CR is the so called Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). This domain is concerned with small-scale radio networks in general, and use of CR technologies in hospital environment in particular. It is expected that it can eventually lead to technologies not just for health care facilities, but also for in-home use and much more. Already with extant technology it is possible to create miniature wireless sensor devices to be placed on human body for monitoring and analysis purposes. What has not been solved yet, is the way various WBAN sensors would communicate with each other without creating interference. Recent advancements in CRS saw developments of control mechanisms for different applications, especially for larger scale (city/regional/national) uses of vacating TV broadcasting spectrum, based on utilization of Geolocation Database (GDB) as communication control registry and visualization tool. In this paper we propose technical characteristics for a controlling database (DB) to allocate radio resources and to be deployed in a hospital environment for WBAN, thus contributing to the ongoing development in CR domain.},

 abstract = {Efficient algorithms for time synchronization, including compensation for clock drift, are essential in order to obtain reliable fusion of data samples from multiple wireless sensor nodes. This paper evaluates the performance of algorithms based on three different approaches; one that synchronizes the local clocks on the sensor nodes, and a second that uses a single clock on the receiving node (e.g. a mobile phone), and a third that uses broadcast messages. The performances of the synchronization algorithms are evaluated in wireless personal area networks, especially Bluetooth piconets and ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 networks. A new approach for compensation of clock drift and a realtime implementation of single node synchronization from the mobile phone are presented and tested. Finally, applications of data fusion and time synchronization are shown in two different use cases; a kayaking sports case, and monitoring of heart and respiration of prematurely born infants.},
