 abstract = {Streaming and analysis of time series body sensor data have been well investigated recently for various applications, especially on health data monitoring. However, existing strategies work independently from each other. Obviously, lacking appropriate information sharing, feedback, and interaction mechanisms, these strategies, even in combination, do not provide an efficient and effective solution for real time body sensor data collection, transmission, and analysis. In this work, we propose a data analysis driven framework with feedback for efficient streaming of body sensor data. The core idea of this framework is based on a data analysis algorithm specific variance threshold that identifies the data reliability requirement. Then, a reliability index is generated and sent from the data aggregator to sensors as a feedback to guide the streaming protocol. At the sensor side, a data importance ranking and grouping strategy is designed so that samples that affect data analysis most significantly are given higher priority for transmission.},

 abstract = {The importance of wireless technology in modern medicine has increased in the last years. It is anticipated that a large number of wireless communication devices for e-health will operate in unlicensed frequency bands in indoor environments. This represents a coexistence problem, which will be particularly challenging in confined areas of hospitals. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) from wireless devices can disrupt the performance of non-communication electronic medical equipment. Cognitive radio is a technology that can ease the coexistence by protecting non-communication electronic medical equipment. In this work we improved a cognitive radio EMI-aware protocol for e-health applications. The original protocol protects medical equipment from harmful interference by preventing wireless transmissions when interference immunity levels are exceeded. However, this leads to high outage probability in areas where protected medical apparatuses are located. In order to maintain a low outage probability under this scheme, we propose the use of an additional channel in a different frequency band for control/data transmission from potential interference sources. We considered the recently allocated 2360--2400 MHz for medical body area networks and the 902--928 MHz band for allocation of the additional control/data channel. Simulation results demonstrated that the use of the proposed dual-band EMI-aware protocol using the 902--928 MHz band significantly reduces the outage probability.},

 abstract = {Each year, millions of Muslims visit the holy sites in Makkah and Madinah. The so-called Hajj pilgrimage is one of the biggest annual events in the world. The individual impact on participating pilgrims is significant, with many of the pilgrims reporting it as a life-changing event. However, quite a little is done to objectively monitor the pilgrims and to understand, from the individual point of view, the characteristics of each of the pilgrimage stages. In this work, through observing differences in bio-physiological responses of the subjects during prayers, we are able to differentiate, in the first case, between congregational prayers and individual prayers, and, in the second case, between silent prayers and loud prayers. We collected data from 10 participants in an 8-day pilgrimage using two wearable sensors, namely chest belts and wrist-worn devices. We derive features from ECG, respiration and GSR data, and use the ANOVA model to analyze feature groups. Based on that, we build classifiers to differentiate between types of prayers. The SVM classifier shows the best performance with a mean accuracy rate of 78 % for the first case, and 84 % for the second case.},

 abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) have been widely adopted to efficiently monitor patients' realtime health condition for medical treatment and emergency handling. Key agreement with the properties of plug-n-play and transparency for WBANs is indispensably required to establish the secure communication channels among body sensors. Existing works mainly focus on exploiting the technique of fuzzy vault to allow body sensors deployed on the same human body can securely establish a pairwise key at a high probability, where the authentic extracted biometric characteristics and the chaff points are indistinguishable from the adversaries' view except a brute attack. However, it simultaneously brings about a large body of additional overhead for dealing with the redundancy. In this paper, a secure and efficient biometric based deterministic key agreement for WBANs is proposed by exploiting the overlap between the biometric characteristics collected by body sensors. The pairwise keys for WBANs can be definitely negotiated by the interactions between body sensors embedded in the same human body. The security depends on the underlying one way trapdoor function rather than the coffer/vault size. Extensive simulations and comparisons illustrate the efficiency and practicability of our proposed construction BDK and the advantages over the state-of-the-art with stronger resilience, less storage, computational and communication overhead.},

The phase difference of arrival at multiple frequencies of a signal is used to estimate the distance of the source to a receiver. The linear least square estimation is used to estimate the initial position of the source followed by a non-linear least square method to improve the localization accuracy. The method is applied on noise free simulated data obtained from FDTD simulations in the 403.5 MHz MedRadio band of a simple homogeneous phantom and a more realistic heterogeneous phantom. The distance between the true position and the estimated position is found to be within 1 cm for the simulated cases showing the possibility to use the proposed method for localization of an RF source inside the human body, as long as the signal to noise ratio is high enough.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a generic small scale channel model for ultra wideband wireless body area network communications. It is based on static on-body measurements in an anechoic chamber by using a vector network analyzer within a 2--8 GHz bandwidth. Two antenna types are used for the examination: dipole and double loop. From the existing data, a generic average channel impulse response (CIR) was extracted resulting 11 and 12 resolvable paths for the dipole and the double loop antenna, respectively, when a dynamic range of 25 dB was used. The CIR envelopes were modelled by using the polynomial least squares (LS) fitting with orders one to five. The 5th order LS model was noted to follow the CIR envelope most precisely. The CIR decays slightly faster for the dipole antenna. The statistical properties of the CIR bins were solved by fitting the data for 17 continuous distributions and ranking them by using the second order Akaike information criterion. To model the CIR amplitudes exactly, four different distributions were needed for the dipole but for an approximate model Weibull and lognormal distributions suffice. For the double loop, all CIR bins follow the inverse Gaussian distribution. The distributions of the CIR bin indexes were found to follow the negative binomial distribution for both antennas.},

An automatic fall detection system, presented in this research, will help reduce the arrival time of medical attention, reduce the mortality rate and in turn promote independent living. This research finds its primary application in the nursing homes and hospitals which account for highest elderly fall as compared to homes. In this research, body falls are detected with the help of a small wearable embedded device. The proposed design aims at distinguishing between a real fall and Activities of Daily Life (ADL). The device is a programmable wrist watch with an in-built accelerometer sensor and microcontroller circuitry. On detection of fall, the watch sends a signal to the neighboring receptor node watch, worn by nurses and alerts them of a fallen patient. The display on these watches notifies as to which patient fell. Signal transmission and reception between these devices is via wireless communication, where every patient watch acts as a sensor node forwarding the signal to the nearest neighboring node.},

Knowing the motion information of the capsule would greatly enhance the localization accuracy. However, design and validate any motion tracking algorithm inside small intestine faces a lot of difficulties since any experimentation on the human being is extremely costly and restricted by law. Having a virtual environment that looks and functions exactly like small intestine would facilitate the process of verifying the performance of existing algorithms without going into the real human body. In this paper, we establish a virtual testbed that emulates the contraction of intestinal lumen and the transition of endoscopic capsule. Under this emulation environment, a velocity estimation algorithm based on a feature detection algorithm (ASIFT) and on a velocity estimation algorithm (MDR) is designed and implemented and its performance has been evaluated. Experimental results showed that our proposed emulation environment is able to provide reliable platform for motion detection validation.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a preliminary diversity reception investigation for the in-body to on-body communication channel in UWB low band for wireless capsule endoscope (WCE) application has been carried out through simulation procedure. Spatial diversity antenna, polarization diversity antenna and a combination of both configurations are designed to overcome the shadow fading due to the position variation of the swallowed capsule. Limited to the simulation capability, representative TX antenna positions in the body are designed in terms of symmetry relationship relative to the diversity reception antenna configurations. The values of the diversity gain using classical combination techniques, i.e., selection combining (SC), equal gain combining (EGC), and maximal ratio combining (MRC), have been calculated and compared. Complex correlation coefficient and power imbalance are given to analyze the diversity performance. Different from the multipath fading in the on-body communication channel, a relatively small diversity gain will be expected resulting from the shadow fading in the in-body to on-body UWB communication channel. It is verified that diversity works at its best if fading at the branches is low correlated and the branch signals have a small power difference.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an experimental modeling framework for energy harvesting sensors in Body Sensor Networks (BSN). Most of BSN applications assume that the sensor nodes have infinite and continuous source of energy. But in reality, this may not be true, especially for the implanted sensors. Instead, the energy for the implanted BSN sensors is likely to come from harvested energy sources such as piezoelectric, magnetic, and thermoelectric generators. In this paper we will explore on-body sensors energy harvesting model using acceleration which is getting a lot of attention in the research community. Recharging batteries with harvested energy could not only extend battery life, but may also dissolve the conventional meaning of network life time. While the energy-harvesting sources can vary widely, we will focus primarily on harvesting using vibration of piezoelectric sensors. Since the piezoelectric energy harvesting depends on movements, the amount of energy harvested at a specific on-body sensor node will depend on the movement pattern of the body part that the node is attached to. As a result, the specific energy generation profile at the BSN nodes does depend on the postural body movement patterns over time.},

The recently published IEEE 802.15.6 standard offers a flexible superframe structure that can be adjusted by the hub to suit the communication requirements of the network and applications. However, the standard leaves the higher level questions open such as: should we use contention-based, scheduled, or improvised access, and under what conditions should we use them? Any MAC protocol that is looking to exploit these access modes should have a clear understanding of their parameters and operating characteristics. In this paper, we present a classifier-based configurable MAC modes for different healthcare applications and evaluate their performance. We considered a challenging scenario of a BAN with heterogenous nodes walking in a high interference environment and quantitatively compared the performance with contention-based and scheduled access modes. The simulation performance evaluation is carried out in OMNET++ with CASTALIA simulator framework. The performance improvements in configurable access mode offers key insights that could be translated to concrete design suggestions to build more efficient MAC protocols.},

In order to enable the user to control the ODW intuitively and safely, a novel human robot interface has been proposed in previous studies to recognize a user's control intentions, including direction, speed, and rotation, according to his/her forearm pressures. Since the features in the pressures exerted by the wrists and elbows are different due to human factors, such as handedness, height and body weight, it is necessary to recognize the control intentions with consideration of these features in order to improve the operability. The features of force exertion with forearms was therefore investigated in a measurement experiment, and was introduced into the calculation of the speed intention by changing the ratio of speed to force according to the direction. A control experiment demonstrated that the consideration of the features resulted in a smoother path and a less burden to the forearms.},

Innovative health-care applications may be deployed using BAN capabilities, and therefore, security issues in BAN shall be carefully considered, since they may have a great impact in the patient's health. Adversaries might create fake emergency warnings, prevent legitimate warnings from being reported, exhaust battery power, produce excessive tissue heating, among other attacks. While efforts have been carried out in the industry and academia to define security requirements in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), more work is needed regarding BAN. In this paper, we consider the differences between BAN and WSN, and examine a selection of known WSN attacks that may be used to damage BAN. We also present a stack based classification of these attacks, and we analyse the security impact of single-hop and dynamic multi-hop topologies in possible routing attacks.

 abstract = {These days, as the Earth's protective ozone layer gets thinner, ultraviolet (UV) radiation threat is growing. In addition, getting tanned as a fashion leads people to wear less clothing, which increases UV intake. Excessive exposure to ultraviolet will lead to sunburn and even skin cancer. Therefore, neither insufficient nor excessive exposure is desirable. Although there are tons of UV meters on the market, a user may have a hard time to understand the unintuitive UV index reading. Thus, there is a potential demand for a portable system which can keep track of daily UV exposure dose, visualize possible sunburned consequences, and provide appropriate skin care recommendations. In this paper, we present a personalized UV monitoring and notification system. This system can continuously track UV exposure by wearable UV sensors. It can also visualize the cumulative UV exposure dose according to a predictive sunburned skin color model. Such an augmented skin color can provide a warning message to indicate the possible result of continuous UV exposure. Compared with other existing systems, our solution not only allows users to monitor their daily UV exposure, but also provides an unobtrusive UV visualization model which effectively warns users to take appropriate actions to avoid potential skin damage. The system has been tested on 9 subjects, and the evaluation feedback indicates that our system is promising for UV monitoring and sunburn prevention.},

It is found that the receiver thus developed can detect the CEMC symbols; however, the performance of the receiver is influenced by two main factors, namely, communication range and transmission data rate.

Each element is composed of a finite number of materials with composition profiles of materials assumed to be known. The proposed model does not require that all material types should have similar attenuation and fading distributions.

 abstract = {Reduced postural stability are symptoms of many medical conditions. Depending on the conditions, there are training or medication strategies to ameliorate the balance of a subject. After medical treatment (surgery etc.) or in the context of an intervention/recovery strategy, these patients are often assessed in functional gait assessments (FGA). An expert, e.g. a Physio Therapist, can decide based on the outcome of such an assessment on future treatment plans. FGAs are often performed with no technological assistance: a subject performs pre-defined tasks and the performance is evaluated visually by an expert. Existing technological assessment tools are scarcely used due to time and monetary restrictions. In this paper, we present a wearable sensor system that can be used for FGAs. Our system comprises a pressure-sensing component and inertial sensors to assess features known to correlate with balance. We validated our system against technological state of the art. We used the system on 6 patients and 5 healthy subjects. The system can distinguish between normal stance and stance with reduced postural control with an accuracy of more than 93%. Walking episodes were classified into two categories with 91%. Based on features of stance and features of gait, our system can discriminate between healthy subjects and subjects with reduced postural stability with an accuracy of 94%},

It is necessary to predict activity of a neuronal network in the brain to control an outer equipment by BCI and BMI exactly. However, it is difficult for the action potential to identify from the input-output data because a neuronal network in the brain is multilayered structure, and the multilayer structure is too complex. Therefore we should discuss an analysis model of action potentials using a simple structure of neuronal network more like a culture dish. In this paper, we propose a model to analyse logicality of signals and connectivity of electrodes in a culture dish. In addition, we introduce a "fuzzy bio-indicator" to show activity of the culture dish of rat hippocampal neurons. We show here the usefulness of fuzzy bio-indicator through numerical examples and action potential detected from the culture neuronal network.},

 abstract = {Nanonetworking is a new research field in which nanotechnology and communication engineering disciplines are employed to explore the possible communication mechanisms at nanoscale. Inspired by living organisms, molecular communication is one of the alternatives that can be used for communication between nanomachines. The research activities on molecular communication depend on simulations to verify and analyze the performance of proposed models. Due to the different channel characteristics, current simulation tools can not be used as is for nanonetworking. Simulation at nanoscale requires modeling of new communication paradigm, hence either existing tools need to be extended, or new tools need to be developed. Since molecular communication involves the modeling of large number of nanoscale objects, scalability of the simulation tool is another important concern. In this paper, we introduce dMCS, a distributed molecular communication simulator design. The proposed architecture is based on High Level Architecture (HLA), which is standardized under IEEE 1516. The results show that using the proposed architecture, it is possible to exploit different scalability options to shorten the execution time significantly. This enables modeling large and complex system simulations.},

One of the main thrusts of BANs is health-related applications, but these networks have a broad range of functionalities. One concern is supplying enough energy to support an active network. There are various designs that satisfy this demand, but an attractive option is the use of energy harvesting devices (EHDs). Typically, an EHD cannot match the energy consumption of a BAN, but there are schemes that can achieve energy self-sustainability at the cost of reducing the throughput. Using prognosis techniques, the time of failure (ToF) can be estimated and the Process-Stacking Multiplexing Access (PSMA) can transmit at specific rates when the ToF is at a predefined range. This can significantly increase the throughput at the cost of energy. This energy is a calculated investment that is expected to be replenished with the objective of not depleting the battery during active periods. Results show that prognosis can significantly increase the throughput.},

 abstract = {The dissociated rat hippocampal neurons on a multielectrodes array dish are useful as simple model of brain information processing system. We analyzed spontaneous activity in the living neuronal network to investigate periodicity and stability of neuronal network activity. Electrical activity pattern at 5 ms time window was represented as a feature vector with 64 elements 0 or 1, corresponding to presence or absence of spike detected at each electrode. X-means clustering method with kkz algorithm preprocessing was applied to the feature vector of each time window. The number of clusters was stable for 30 min with some fluctuations. As extending of clustering range from 5 min to 30 min in 5 min increments, the estimated number of cluster increased, suggesting the number of activity patterns was not stable and increase. However, highly reproducible clusters were stable against extension of clustering range. In addition, the number of highly reproducible clusters was saturated at approximately for 40 s clustering range. These results suggested that the spike patterns compose limited number of highly reproducible clusters and a lot of small clusters derived from reproducible clusters, and highly reproducible clusters were expressed repeatedly. Semi-artificial neuronal network possessed pattern repertories and they are considered to be able to express certain states.},

This type of transmission technique, however, adds higher overhead if the correct channel selection probability is high and/or payload size to transmit is small. In such instance, the direct data transmission technique (i.e. without empty frame in advance) could exhibit better performance. In this paper, to save energy from inappropriate transmission attempt, we propose to use these two transmission schemes adaptively. Nodes will select the transmission mode by taking into account the probability of successful transmission and the payload size. We find payload threshold value that serves as switching criterion between two schemes during various network scenarios.},

In this paper, we design a system that can monitor the running biomechanics, infer running poses, analyze running patterns, and provide both real-time and off-line feedbacks to reduce unnecessary fatigue and unwanted injuries. Common inappropriate running patterns, over-striding, over-pronating and out-sync, are identified and analyzed with the continuous wearable sensor data streams. Two types of correctional feedbacks are designed to provide users appropriate adjustment guidance: vibrating the areas of user body where improper poses are detected and visualizing running video with sensor waveforms to indicate which inappropriate motions trigger the vibration. With reasonable adjustment, running can be a safe and effective activity for a healthy lifestyle.},

It is known that stress can propagate from one individual to others working in close proximity or towards a common goal, e.g., in a military operation or workforce, thus affecting productivity, efficiency, and the ability to make rational decisions. Real-time assessment of the stress of individuals alone is, however, not sufficient as understanding its source and direction in which it propagates in a group is equally if not more important. In this paper, the direction of propagation and magnitude of influence of stress in a group of individuals are studied by applying real-time, in-situ analysis of Granger Causality. G-causality has established itself as one of the promising non-invasive approaches in operational neuroscience to reveal the direction of influence between brain areas by analyzing temporal precedence. Extending G-causality analysis on real-time group data faces, however, communication and computation challenges, to address which a distributed mobile computational framework is employed and workflows defining how data and tasks are divided among the entities of the framework are designed.},

The capsule endoscopy uses a capsule device to convey images taken in the digestive tract wirelessly to a body-worn device. Since the capsule device has small capacity on its battery, compression technique is crucial that is realized in less power consumption. The technique shown in this paper is theoretically based on Slepian-Wolf coding, in which side information available at transmitter side is treated as well as side information at its receiver side. Therefore, energy-hungry processes for achieving video compression including estimation of motion vectors are moved to the receiver side. Simulation results show that the encoding method provides compression rate close to its lower bound for an 8-bit quantized raw (Bayer) data by using a regular low-density parity check (LDPC) under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.},

Afterwards, the average energy consumption per bit is given for both transmission schemes. The optimal relay location for cooperation is also derived and analyzed to minimize the average bit energy consumption. Simulation verifies the analysis and shows that cooperative transmission can achieve a satisfactory improvement on energy efficiency compared with direct transmission over a range of relay locations for UWB based IBANs.

 abstract = {Tetherless care was proposed to help address the costly burden of chronic conditions and diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. In support of this vision, this work presents a solution for the intelligent delivery of realtime messages given intermittent connectivity and limited energy. It employs a O(1) Markov predictor operating over a history of network sessions to predict likely future low power opportunities to transfer data while attending to realtime delivery deadlines. The algorithm was deployed to the smartphones of several volunteers for two months and was tasked with managing the transfer of test data and statistics of its operation. Results show: • Predictions of the duration or start time of a given session have 80% accuracy to within six minutes. • Where delays between successive WiFi sessions are less than nine minutes with 81% probability, the system is capable of supporting deadlines on the order of minutes with WiFi-based sessions only, falling back on more costly cellular technology to cover the final 19% of delays. • With a fixed 24 hour deadline for all messages, the solution can often introduce further delay to conserve energy, waiting for the advent of some future session before initiating transmission.},

BAN is in high requirement for reliable information transmission especially for vital physiological signs. As the external environments and human body motions make the channel characteristics vary frequently, which results in high package error probability and low reliability, the codes with fixed code rate are not suitable. In this paper, we use LT codes to automatically adapt to the time-varying channel condition. LT codes were firstly proposed to provide reliability for erasure channel, followed by fading channel. The efficiency of LT codes in BAN had been analyzed by simulation, only considering the medical implant communications service. Hence, we conduct a large number of experiments to analyze and verify the adaptability of LT codes to dynamic channel especially in wearable BAN. In order to carry on a comprehensive analysis, the reliability of LT codes are tested under different scenarios, such as indoor and outdoor scenes. The influence of human motion and transmission distance are also taken into account. The results demonstrate that LT codes have a good performance of reliability over on-body communication channel.},

With the rapid development of monitoring and sensing applications, activity recognition on mobile devices or portable platforms has drawn lots of attentions. Constrained by computing capability and energy budget, activity recognition on mobile devices faces the challenge of hungry energy consumption. Most of the existing work focus on modeling and recognizing activities accurately, however, without computational cost consideration. In this paper, we present WCF: Wavelet Coefficients based Features for activity recognition, which are cost-effective on feature extraction. WCF are extracted from wavelet domain of the sensory raw data and describes the timbre and rhythm properties of activities. Feature space in WCF is hierarchical. Compared with other features, WCF are extracted with less computational cost and redundancy. And WCF have better classification accuracy on activity recognition task. Experiments are conducted on the large public data set USC-HAD to recognize 11 kinds of activities, and our approach outperforms others by reducing 55% ~ 75% computational cost as well as achieving 96.23% classification accuracy.},

In a case study, we monitored two patients carrying the smartphone 9 days before and another 9 days after a surgical intervention. Results indicate significant activity changes after intervention while the pain level decreased. Particularly physical activity in the home environment increased significantly for both patients where an averaged 98% increase in walking and a more than 150% gain in fast cadence was measured.

Molecular communication networks are composed of bionanomachines which can interact with biomolecules or cells through transmission of molecules. One promising approach for generic communications is directional transport of molecules, such as by bacteria, to transmit molecules to another bionanomachine at a specific spatial location in an environment. In this paper, bacteria move to spatial locations relative to molecular beacons. Each molecular beacon emits a different type of molecule to produce a concentration gradient. A bacterium has a chemotactic pathway tuned for estimating its direction relative to the concentration gradients, and the specific concentrations at which the chemotactic pathway saturate represents a specific spatial address. Through simulation modeling, receptor parameters of bacteria were tuned to target various spatial addresses, and the latency and success rate of communication were characterized for receivers positioned at each spatial address.},

This paper presents a new multi-clustering approach for pattern recognition of big data in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with multi-validation criteria. Specifically, a nutritional dataset was used to demonstrate our approach, which was generated from an NIH-funded RCT for patients with metabolic syndrome. The proposed approach includes a suite of emerging and popular clustering methods: probability-based Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Hidden Markov Random Fields(HMRFs), Self-Organizing Map (SOM)-based neural networks, K-means and Agglomerative Hierarchical method. Using our RCT data and multi-validation criteria, our approach identified a most sufficient set of nutritional variables and detected distinct dietary change patterns with a universal agreement among the proposed multi-methods. The trajectory patterns were then generated using the method with the most clustering accuracy which was cross-validated via simulation. These patterns generated new and finer results for outcomes of the RCT. While our approach demonstrated a more accurate and comprehensive clustering only for nutritional data in RCT, it can be generalized to big data in other research fields.},

The semi-artificial living neuronal circuit is useful as a buffer circuit of the brain-device interface. To elucidate characters of the living components of the brain is critical for constructing a functional semi-artificial neuronal circuit. This study confirmed by Ca2+ imaging that functional connections could be formed between neurons derived from different distant species. In addition, the degree and spatiotemporal pattern of the activity in the mixed neuronal circuit was changed by manipulations of the synaptic strength. Especially, neuronal electrical events were strongly activated by the abolishment of inhibitory synaptic inputs. Not only activity pattern but also connectivity between rat and chick neuron was changed by the modification of synaptic efficacy. These results suggested that the mixed circuit of neurons derived from chick and rat is critical model case of an artificial living neuronal circuit.},

Since the shape of small intestine is extremely complex and the length of small intestine varies from 5 to 9 meters, localization of the WCE inside the small intestine is very challenging. Traditional radio frequency (RF) localization techniques using the received signal strength (RSS) are not able to provide satisfactory location information of the capsule inside the small intestine. In this paper, we present a hybrid localization technique that takes advantage of data fusion from image sequence captured by the WCE's embedded camera and the RSS of the RF signal emitted by the capsule to enhance the positioning accuracy. The proposed method estimates the speed and direction of movement of the capsule by analyzing displacements of feature points between consecutive image frames and this motion information is integrated with RSS measurements by employing a Kalman filter to smooth the RF localization results. Performance of the proposed method is validated under a virtual testbed that emulates the transition of capsule inside small intestine against the traditional RSS-based RF localization.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a mobile food intake monitoring system. The system works based on a key observation that a person's otherwise continuous breathing signal is interrupted by a short apnea during swallowing. The breathing signal is collected using two Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography (RIP) belts on the chest and abdomen, and wirelessly transmitted to an Android smart phone via Bluetooth. Support Vector Machine estimating the posterior probability is applied on the extracted features. Through experiments on six healthy subjects, the system is demonstrated to be an effective way of monitoring food and drink intake. The key novelty of this paper includes 1) a non-invasive RIP belt system for swallow detection without any cosmetic and wearing discomfort issues, and 2) a smart phone to collect data wirelessly and execute swallow detection algorithms before uploading the results to the cloud for enabling remote health monitoring.},

 abstract = {Wireless body area networks (WBANs) used in conjunction with various types of biological sensors have shown promise as a means of supporting medical and healthcare services, and in recent years, the use of wearable devices that utilize the human body as a transmission channel has grown rapidly. However, the multipath environment encountered in daily life typically incurs a large path loss. In this paper, we examine the path loss occurring in the high frequency (HF) and ultrahigh frequency (UHF) bands in order to compare the efficiency and reliability of communication. As a preliminary effort, we extract the effects of arm movement on the performance of human body communication (HBC) systems by investigating the path loss occurring during arm waving, both with simulation software and experimentally in an anechoic chamber. Our results show that the HF band experiences lower path loss than does the UHF band. The experimental result shows a close agreement with the results of the simulation.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a novel arm gesture recognition approach that is capable of recognizing seven commonly used sequential arm gestures based upon the outputs from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated with 3-D accelerometer and 3-D gyroscope. Unlike the traditional gesture recognition methods where the states in the gesture sequence are irrelevant, our proposed recognition system is intentionally designed to recognize the meaningful gesture sequence where each gesture state relates to the contiguous states which is applicable in the specific occasions such as the police directing the traffic and the arm-injured patients performing a set of arm gestures for effective rehabilitation. In the proposed arm gesture recognition system, the waveforms of the inertial outputs, i.e., 3-D accelerations and 3-D angular rates are automatically segmented for each arm gesture trace at first. Then we employ the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - a computationally efficient feature selection method characteristic of compressing the inertial data and minimizing the influences of gesture variations. These selected features from PCA are compared with those standard features stored in pattern templates to acquire the gesture observation sequence that satisfy the Markov property. Finally, the Hidden Markov Model is applied in deducing the most likely arm gesture sequence. The experimental results show that our arm gesture classifier achieves up to 93% accuracy. By comparing with the other published recognition methods, our approach verifies the robustness and feasibility in arm gesture recognition using wearable MEMS sensors.},

In this work, we focus on accurate EEE for tracking ambulatory activities (walking, standing, climbing upstairs or downstairs) of a common smartphone user. We used existing smartphone sensors (accelerometer and barometer sensor), sampled at low frequency, to accurately detect EEE. Using Artificial Neural Networks, a machine learning technique, we build a generic regression model for EEE that yields upto 89% correlation with actual Energy Expenditure (EE). Using barometer data, in addition to accelerometry is found to significantly improve EEE performance (upto 15%). We compare our results against state-of-the-art Calorimetry Equations (CE) and consumer electronics devices (Fitbit and Nike+ Fuel Band).

We measured signal intensity to compare two methods of measurement with a battery-powered transmitter and an AC-powered signal generator. The results revealed that the AC-powered signal generator affected the communication path. Furthermore, we successfully found a distance dependence of signal loss between transceivers on the human body. We clarified the necessity for properly setting the transmitter power and receiver sensitivity that corresponded to the distance dependence of signal loss.},

One popular application of these systems is to track the real-time body movements of a patient by analyzing and classifying the physiological signals collected by the video sensors or the body-mounted mechanical sensors. However, the existing motion monitoring infrastructures are inconvenient to be carried with the patient. In this paper, we explore the potential of using the inexpensive off-the-shelf inertial sensors that embedded in the smart phones to identify the body movements. In our proposed system, variance, energy, and frequency domain entropy of linear acceleration and rotating orientation are extracted from the inertial sensors to form the feature vector. To enhance the performance of the system, quantitative metrics of RF propagation characteristics: level crossing rate, Doppler Spread, coherence time, Root Mean Square (RMS) Doppler bandwidth and variation of Path Loss are also investigated to provide new descriptors to the feature space. These features are imported and tested by four most commonly used machine learning algorithms: Backpropagation network (BP), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Results show that using features from both RF sensor and inertial sensor would greatly improve the classification accuracy.},

Cooperation between Home Area Networks (HAN) and Body Area Networks (BAN) can provide smart systems with ad hoc reasoning information to support health care. This paper details the implementation of an architecture that integrates BAN, HAN and intelligent agents to manage physiological and environmental data to proactively detect risk situations at the digital home. The system monitors dynamic situations and timely adjusts its behavior to detect user risks concerning to health. Thus, this work provides a reasoning framework to infer appropriate solutions in cases of health risk episodes. Proposed smart health monitoring approach integrates complex reasoning according to home environment, user profile and physiological parameters defined by a scalable ontology. As a result, health care demands can be detected to activate adequate internal mechanisms and report public health services for requested actions.},

 abstract = {Routing under energy harvesting constraints is considered. A routing protocol based on Dijkstra's global routing algorithm is proposed and evaluated. The protocol dynamically modifies routing trees based on available energy accumulated through energy harvesting. Channel-state information is gathered in typical indoor environments using two experimental setups; one with eight nodes and on-body access point and the other with five nodes and an off-body access point equipped with four antennas. Collected data is used to evaluate network connectivity in conjuncture with throughput using computer simulations and models of energy harvesting. Energy sources of body heat, ambient light, direct sunlight and ambient airflow are considered. A threshold effect is observed for all energy sources and both experimental setups; if the throughput is set below threshold value the network is reliably connected. The thresholds are shown to be higher than 500 bytes/sec for direct sunlight and within 80--190 bytes/sec for other energy sources when using currently available energy harvesting technology.},

 abstract = {Body sensor networks (BSNs) are an emerging class of medical cyber-physical systems which have the potential to change the healthcare paradigm. However, they present many new challenges, chief of which (like any medical device) is assuring patient safety. This requires not only a precise definition of safety, but also techniques for assessing the safety of BSN designs. Although solutions are possible and important for specific BSNs used in specific applications, addressing this issue on a case-by-case basis usually results in an ad-hoc process, and more importantly, makes the translation of experiences and solutions between different applications more difficult. A generic and conceptual framework for guiding the safety analysis process would provide all stakeholders a common basis for communicating, discussing, and examining the safety of BSN designs, and provide manufacturers with an exemplary process that they can follow to improve and gain confidence in the safety of their devices. This paper presents our current efforts in developing such a framework. In particular, we present a theoretical foundation for modeling and analyzing BSNs, and identify the general class of hazards based on this foundation. These efforts explore critical issues that deserve attention in designing safe BSN systems, and more importantly, can help advance the understanding of BSNs and their safety.},

In this paper, four inertial sensors were placed on wrist, chest, hip and ankle of 19 subjects, which had to perform seven daily life activities. Each sensor node separately performed preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. In the final step, the classifier decisions of the sensor nodes were fused and a single activity was predicted by majority voting. The proposed classification system obtained an overall mean classification rate of 93.9 % and was robust against defect sensors.

However, improvement of the camera model calibration is indispensible for more precise measurement. In this study, we propose a camera modeling technique for 3D sensing based on tile coding (CMAC) structure. A distance between a sensing target and the camera is used to construct the camera model considering optical projection characteristics. In our approach, the least mean square error method is successfully applied considering the simple tile structure to formulate the camera model. Then iterative calculations for solving the inverse problem of the 3-D to 2-D projection by camera are performed to attain measured 3D coordinates. Through sensing experiments of stereo vision measurement based on the proposed approach, we showed the performance of the model was drastically improved compared with the conventional modeling approach such as Open CV model or crisp partitioned model.},

To obtain this information, a machine-learning approach is often preferred to first principle modeling for its generality in dealing with systematic errors. In this approach, extracting predictive features is critical to the estimation accuracy. Therefore, identifying and extracting highly correlated features for gait speed estimation become the first important steps for the machine-learning framework. This paper proposes a novel nonlinear feature for gait speed estimation using shank-mounted inertial sensors. Rooted in analytic mechanics, this nonlinear feature captures the dynamics of angular position and angular velocity -- two interdependent variables for gait speed -- simultaneously by examining the area of the phase portrait. Among all the features extracted, this nonlinear feature was ranked as the most important by an automatic feature selection algorithm given its highest correlation with gait speed among all features evaluated, and it improves the accuracy for gait speed estimation in intra-subject cross validation compared to using commonly extracted linear features alone.},

In conventional ad hoc wireless networks, the specific arrangement of reservations within a TDMA frame is of minor importance as long as all nodes asking for a reservation are granted one within a frame interval. Yet emergency event preemptions or possible sensor-initiated and uncoordinated extensions of granted schedules, which seem inevitable for WBAN applications, make reservation arrangement an important problem. Here, such events could transgress an already scheduled reservation of maybe another node, jeopardizing the latter's transmission opportunity. This is more of an issue if we consider the power-limited nature of WBAN nodes, limiting the time they can keep awake looking forward for a maybe delayed transmission opportunity. In this paper we study the optimal arrangement of slave nodes' reservations which seeks to best fulfill the traffics' QoS requirements subject to a power consumption constraint. In that we account for nodes' reservation lengths, traffic QoS requirements, and the corresponding statistical characteristics of reservation extensions and emergencies. Our strategy protects the reservations of the more QoS-constrained of slaves' applications against the possible preemptions of others and also provides them with adequate bandwidth if they ever needed to extend their reservation on the fly.},

 abstract = {Tracking a capsule endoscope location is one of promising application offered by implant body area networks (BANs). In this paper, we pay attention to a particle filter algorithm with received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based localization in order to solve the capsule endoscope location tracking problem, which assumes a nonlinear transition model on the capsule endoscope location. However, the original particle filter requires to calculate the particle weight according to its condition (namely, its likelihood value), while the transition model on capsule endoscope location has some model parameters which cannot be estimated by received wireless signal. Therefore, for the purpose of applying the particle filter to the capsule endoscope tracking, this paper makes some modifications in the resampling step of the particle filter algorithm. Our computer simulation results demonstrates that the proposed tracking methods with the modified particle filter can improve the performance as compared with not only the conventional maximum likelihood (ML) localization but also the original particle filter-based location tracking.},

As an example of interfacing algorithm between neuronal activity and robot behavior, we implemented SOM-based algorithm to generate robot behavior. The winner nodes of SOM were gradually gathered together by each category during a robot running, suggesting the mapping between inputted data and corresponding representative position in the clustering space is correctly updated during the robot behavior.

 abstract = {Body area networks can be utilized to monitor and maintain core body temperature for individuals with impaired thermoregulation. An imbalance between heat gain and dissipation may lead to higher core body temperature. Heat stress caused by abnormally high body temperature increases the risk of heat stroke that may lead to tissue damage, neuronal impairment and potentially death. Thermoregulation may become impaired due to neurological dysfunction resulting from spinal cord injury, head injury, disease, cancer treatments or old age. This project developed a prototype of a scaled down (10:1) model of a cooling vest system. Sensors of core body temperature would be utilized by a microcontroller module to regulate the perfusion of water within a cooling vest. Water was pumped from a reservoir, perfused through a vest, and returned back to the reservoir. A thermoelectric cooler (Peltier device) transferred heat between the water in the reservoir and atmosphere air. An experimental test of the ability of the cooling vest system to lower the temperature of saline in a bladder in the chest of a teddy bear model was conducted. The pre-warmed saline was cooled more during the 4 minute test if the cooling vest system was on the bear compared to when the vest was not on the bear. Testing on a larger scale model will be necessary for further development of the system.},

At present, there are many types of heart rate measurement sensors, including those that are attached to the fingertips, chest, and wrist. However, these types of sensors are unsuitable for home healthcare use because they are too bothersome for daily use. These sensors use a photoplethysmogram to measure the heart rate. Although a breathing signal is also superimposed on the heart rate, the problem is that this signal is very weak and unstable. In the work described in this paper, we developed a reliable breathing rate and heart rate measurement sensor. The sensor is attached on the wrist, like a wristwatch. Such wrist-worn sensors already exist, but they are unreliable due to their generally low sensitivity. In contrast, our newly developed sensor employs an array of multiple photo-interrupters and selects the most reliable photo-interrupter by employing a unique algorithm. In addition, the sensor data is sent to a data logger wirelessly in order to achieve stress-free daily health care monitoring.},

A method to estimate the cognitive scale of the dynamic parameter and a method to extract the characteristic components necessary for perception are also proposed. The proposed methods have been applied to loading motion.

However, most motion analysis systems are expensive and can only be used in a laboratory environment. Ambulatory motion analysis systems using inertial sensors would allow more flexible use, e.g. in a real training environment or even during competitions. This paper presents the calculation of the flexion-extension knee angle from segment acceleration and angular rates measured using body-worn inertial sensors. Using a functional calibration procedure, the sensors are first aligned without the need of an external camera system. An extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the relative orientations of thigh and shank, from which the knee angle is calculated. The algorithm was validated by comparing the computed knee angle to the output of a reference camera motion tracking system. In total seven subjects performed five dynamic motions: walking, jogging, running, jumps and squats. The averaged root mean squared error of the estimated knee angle was 8.2° ± 2.4° over all motions, with an average Pearson-correlation of 0.971 ± 0.020. In the future this will allow the analysis of joint angles during dynamic sports movements.},

 abstract = {In recent years, provisioning of human-centric services through body area networks, robotics technology and cloud computing is continuously attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. In this paper, we propose a novel robotics and cloud-assisted healthcare system (ROCHAS), which combines these three technologies to provide pervasive healthcare services and especially the mental healthcare for empty-nester who are typically old-aged, lonely and depressed. ROCHAS includes four major components, i.e., robotics-assisted health monitoring and healthcare services, wireless and wired networks, cloud-assisted healthcare system, and healthcare service supporting infrastructure.},

 abstract = {Body area networks (BAN) require careful hardware and software design which will enable the battery powered sensor devices to operate effectively and reliably over long periods of time. On body sensor design is a challenging task due to the body being in the near-field of the radio and the complex interaction between the two. Off-the-shelf wireless sensors can be optimized to realize an efficient BAN by combining an enhanced shorted patch antenna design with a cross layer energy aware protocol. Here, we demonstrate a system design approach where the performance of WBANs is greatly enhanced.},

 abstract = {Recently, wireless body area networks (WBAN) have attracted attention. As an international standard of WBANs suitable for medical fields, IEEE802.15.6 has been established in February 2012. In this standard, it is possible to divide the quality of service (QoS) of handled data into 7 different user priorities. However, means for the concrete realization in accordance with these priorities is implementation-dependent in UWB-PHY. From this problem, we has employed Decomposable codes and Weldon's ARQ for the proposed scheme in order to adjust balance between error correcting capability of codes and the number of retransmission according to each medical QoS. We have showed that the proposed scheme has been able to improve BER and throughput performances satisfying each medical QoS by computer simulation.},
