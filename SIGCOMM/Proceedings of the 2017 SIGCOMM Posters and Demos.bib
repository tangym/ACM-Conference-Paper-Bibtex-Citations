 abstract = {SDN approaches to inter-domain routing promise better traffic engineering, enhanced security, and higher automation. Yet, naïve deployment of SDN on the Internet is dangerous as the control-plane expressiveness of BGP is significantly more limited than the data-plane expressiveness of SDN, which allows fine-grained rules to deflect traffic from BGP's default routes. This mismatch may lead to incorrect forwarding behaviors such as forwarding loops and blackholes, ultimately hindering SDN deployment at the inter-domain level. In this work, we make a first step towards verifying the correctness of inter-domain forwarding state with a focus on loop freedom while keeping private the SDN rules, as they comprise confidential routing information. To this end, we design a simple yet powerful primitive that allows two networks to verify whether their SDN rules overlap, i.e., the set of packets matched by these rules is non-empty, without leaking any information about the SDN rules. We propose an efficient implementation of this primitive by using recent advancements in Secure Multi-Party Computation and we then leverage it as the main building block for designing a system that detects Internet-wide forwarding loops among any set of SDN-enabled Internet eXchange Points.},

The traditional TCP/IP communication paradigm was not designed to handle these requirements at the envisioned scale. This calls for a novel networking paradigm. This paper makes the case for the use of the Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm to create the smart grid network architecture. We quantitatively assess the gains resulting from ICN's inherent functionalities, such as concurrent use of multiple interfaces, request aggregation, and stateful forwarding, which enable timely critical message delivery and fast packet re-transmissions. We perform simulations to compare IP and ICN-based smart grid deployments. Our results show that the ICN-based solution outperforms the IP-based solution, especially in a network with packet losses.},

 abstract = {Fog computing, also known as Edge computing, is an emerging computational paradigm, increasingly utilized in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, particularly those that cannot be served efficiently using Cloud computing due to limitations such as bandwidth, latency, Internet connectivity. At present, the norm is the static allocation of tasks by developers of an application, where some IoT applications are allocated to be performed on the Cloud, some on the Fog, and some on a hybrid Cloud-Fog. The applications are pre-programmed and predefined to be run on a platform, and this is unchangeable at run-time. IoT gateways, which are devices that bridge the IoT local network and the Internet, are in a position to make dynamic adjustments and allocation decision between platforms based upon real-time conditions such as an IoT applications' performance. However, currently there is no (or very little) intelligence embedded into IoT gateways. This paper proposes cognitive IoT gateways powered by cognitive analytics and machine learning to improve the performance of IoT applications. These IoT devices are able to automatically learn and decide when and where to run an application, be that on the Cloud or on the Fog. The dynamic task sharing and platform interchanging will enable the IoT applications to be optimized for multiple objectives including task performance.},

The network functions implemented as virtual machines or containers use the same hardware resources (cpu, memory) as the elements responsible for networking, therefore, a low-level resource orchestrator which is capable of jointly controlling these resources is an indispensable component. In this demonstration, we showcase our novel resource orchestrator (FERO) on top of a data plane making use of open-source components such as, Docker, DPDK and OVS. It is capable of i) generating an abstract model of the underlying hardware architecture during the bootstrap process, ii) mapping the incoming network service requests to available resources based on our recently proposed Service Graph embedding engine and the generated graph model. The impact of the orchestration decision is shown on-the-fly by real-time performance measurements on a graphical dashboard.},

 abstract = {Mobile video delivery drives Internet traffic evolution and puts colossal pressure on future 5G networks to support higher quality and lower latency requirements over an increasingly heterogeneous network access. Future Internet paradigms recentering communication around content, such as Information Centric Networks (ICN), appear as promising candidates to relieve the challenges of a mobility-robust, efficient and cost-effective video delivery, by integrating video-awareness at network layer. In this demo, we focus on ICN-enabled Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DAS) over an heterogeneous wireless access. We integrate ICN capabilities in DAS clients requesting 4K video content to standard DAS servers. We deploy a virtualized ICN-enabled network slice using LXC containers to connect clients to servers through an heterogeneous wireless access (802.11n and LTE emulated radios) and a simplified backhaul. The contribution of the demo is twofold. First it showcases what ICN can bring to DAS over a mobile heterogeneous access in virtue of its content-awareness at network layer. Second, it offers to the user a rich sandbox where several state-of-the-art DAS controllers are implemented and can be tested over ICN or standard TCP.},

However, there are still some obstacles on the way to the widespread adoption. Current commodity-off-the-shelf (COTS) SDN offerings are still in their infancy and are notorious for lacking standards compliance, scalability, and unpredictable performance indicators compared to their legacy counterparts. On the other hand, recent software-based solutions might mitigate these shortcomings, but in terms of cost-efficiency and port density they are in a lower league. Here, we present HARMLESS, a novel SDN switch design that combines the rapid innovation and upgrade cycles of software switches with the port density of hardware-based appliances into a fully data plane-transparent, vendor-neutral and cost-effective solution for smaller enterprises to gain a foothold in this era. The demo showcases the SDN migration of a dumb legacy Ethernet switch to a powerful, fully reconfigurable, OpenFlow-enabled network device without incurring any major performance and latency penalty, nor any substantial price tag enabling to realize many use cases that would have otherwise needed standalone hardware appliances.},

While different wireless protocols have been utilized in sensor networks, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has drawn a lot of attention in the past years due to its low-power architecture and availability in many consumer electronics. Moreover, the added non-connectable beacon mode has increased its functionality for Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor fusion. However, in this mode as devices are not paired with each other no synchronization service is available. In this paper, we present a synchronization protocol based on BLE beacons that can be used in conjunction with BLE software stacks provided with a commercial Bluetooth System-on-Chip (SoC). Offset and frequency-drift estimation techniques are discussed, and the effects of number of synchronization packets and their intervals on the overall synchronization accuracy are investigated. Experimental results show that without any re-synchronization in ten minutes, average synchronization errors of less than 350 ns per minute (single hop) can be achieved.},

 abstract = {We propose a demonstration of DeDoS, a platform for mitigating asymmetric DDoS attacks. These attacks are particularly challenging since attackers using limited resources can exhaust the resources of even well-provisioned servers. DeDoS resolves this by splitting monolithic software stacks into separable components called minimum splittable units (MSUs). If part of the application stack is experiencing a DDoS attack, DeDoS can massively replicate only the affected MSUs, potentially across many machines. This allows scaling of the impacted resource separately from the rest of the application stack so that resources can be precisely added where needed to combat the attack. Our demonstration will show that DeDoS incurs reasonable overheads in normal operations and that it significantly outperforms naïve replication when defending against a range of asymmetric attacks.},

The canonical throughput model [2], while useful, has some limitations since it does not consider how packet loss rate changes over time. This approach leads to poor predictions for short flows. We present a new modeling approach that characterizes the throughput and latency models by: (i) discovering the relationship between the packet loss rate and the congestion window size, and (ii) incorporating the starting congestion window and the number of parallel connections. Experimental results show that our models significantly improve modeling accuracy.},

 abstract = {This demo presents RFind, a system that enables fine-grained RFID localization via ultra-wideband emulation. RFind operates by measuring the time-of-flight -- i.e., the time it takes the signal to travel from an antenna to an RFID tag. To do so, it emulates an ultra-wide bandwidth on today's narrowband RFIDs without requiring any hardware modification to the tags. It then uses the large emulated bandwidth to estimate the time-of-flight and localize RFIDs. In contrast to past RFID localization proposals, RFind can operate in multipath-rich environments without reference tags and without requiring tag or antenna motion. The demo will allow users to move RFID-tagged objects to any location in line-of-sight, non-line-of-sight, and multi-path rich settings and check that the system can accurately localize the objects.},

Existing applications are often designed around socket based software stack that manages application buffers separately from networking buffers and do memory copies between them when sending/receiving data. With large sized (up to hundreds MB) application buffers, the cost of such copies adds non trivial overhead to the end-to-end communication pipeline. In this work, we made an attempt to design a zero copy transport for distribute dataflow frameworks that unifies application and networking buffer management and completely eliminates unnecessary memory copies. Our prototype on top of TensorFlow shows 2.43x performance improvement over gRPC based transport and 1.21x performance improvement over an alternative RDMA transport with private buffers and memory copies.},

Despite the important role that they fulfill, there is a long history of vulnerabilities allowing attackers to breach security and availability of the clients and services on SOHO networks. Following the multiple disclosures and recommendations for patches in the last two decades it seems an obvious question to verify whether the reality meets the expectation. We focus on an important class of vulnerabilities called 'authentication bypass', which allow an attacker to take control over a network device by subverting the authentication procedure. We perform a stealthy and non disruptive evaluation of authentication bypass vulnerabilities in SOHO routers. Our study focuses on a number of selected countries, to detect presence of vulnerable devices. The results of our study are worrisome: we find a large fraction of misconfigurations and insecurity issues in configuration of SOHO routers, which stand in sharp contrast to the awareness of the security and research communities to the vulnerabilities as well as a large body of work studying related topics.},

Most research that leverages the DNS for detection of malicious activities does so by using passive measurements. The limitation of this approach, however, is that it is effective only once an attack is ongoing. In this paper, we explore a different approach. We advocate the use of active DNS measurements for pro-active (i.e., before the actual attack) identification of domains set up for malicious use. Our research makes uses of data from the OpenINTEL large-scale active DNS measurement platform, which, since February 2015, collects daily snapshots of currently more than 60% of the DNS namespace. We illustrate the potential of our approach by showing preliminary results in three case studies, namely snowshoe spam, denial of service attacks and a case of targeted phishing known as CEO fraud.},

We investigate the performance of cuckoo filters with Cisco's VPP (Vector Packet Processing) for IP lookup. We also introduce a variant called a length-aware cuckoo filter that treats incoming IP addresses discriminatively, and study its performance with VPP. As proof-of-concept, we implement cuckoo filters with VPP, and test them on both functions and performance with focus on the ip6-input node in VPP.},

Key features of NS4 include (1) elimination of laborious and redundant work for developing internal models of the simulator; (2) direct migration from simulation code to real-world P4 devices; (3) simulation of P4-enabled devices and network systems; (4) seamless compatibility with ns-3; (5) better scalability over other P4 behavioral model validation tools. We proposed and prototyped NS4 by integrating a P4 behavioral model in ns-3, and evaluated its effectiveness by a user case study.

 abstract = {BGP, the only inter-domain routing protocol used today, often converges slowly upon outages. While fast-reroute solutions exist, they can only protect from local outages, not remote ones (e.g., a failure in a transit network). To address this problem, we proposed SWIFT, a fast-reroute framework enabling BGP routers to locally restore connectivity upon remote outages by combining fast inference mechanisms in the control-plane with fast data plane updates. While SWIFT is deployable on a per-router basis, we show in this demonstration that we can deploy SWIFT in Software-Defined Internet Exchange Points (SDXes) with a simple software update. We show that "SWIFTing" an SDX is highly beneficial as it enables to converge the entire fabric within few seconds instead of the tens of seconds required by the original software.},

 abstract = {Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) has been an area of interest among researchers from academia and industry. SDNs, however, also introduce new challenges, for example researchers work under strict time constraints and need to conduct frequent experiments to verify their ideas on scalable simulation of real-life topologies. The challenge is two-fold: first, the researchers need to manually generate the topologies and second, manually configure the devices in the generated topologies to enable routing protocols. We demonstrate two novel tools, namely, Topology Generator and Enhanced Automatic Configuration RouteFlow (EACRF), which automatically generate the custom scalable topologies at the SDN data plane and configure routing protocols like BGP and OSPF, at the SDN control plane, in a seamless fashion in quick time. EACRF is an enhancement of RouteFlow which can be used in con/junction with Topology Generator or independently.},

It consists of a performance query language, Marple, modeled on familiar functional operators like map, filter, and groupby. Marple is supported by a programmable key-value store on switches, which can compute flexible aggregated statistics (e.g., per-flow counts, moving averages over queueing latencies) over packets at line rate. Our switch design implements performance queries which could previously run only on end hosts, while utilizing only a modest fraction of switch hardware resources. To demonstrate the utility of Marple, we compile Marple queries to a P4-programmable software switch running within Mininet. We demonstrate two example use cases of Marple: diagnosing the root cause of latency spikes and measuring the flowlet size distribution.},

@inproceedings{vanRijswijk-Deij:2017:RCM:3123878.3131987,
 abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the core of the Internet. Over the past decade, much-needed security features were added to this protocol, with the introduction of the DNS Security Extensions. DNSSEC adds authenticity and integrity to the protocol using digital signatures, and turns the DNS into a public key infrastructure (PKI). At the top of this PKI is a single key, the so-called Key Signing Key (KSK) for the DNS root. The current Root KSK was introduced in 2010, and has not changed since. This year, the Root KSK will be replaced for the first time ever. This event potentially has a major impact on the Internet. Thousands of DNS resolvers worldwide rely on this key to validate DNSSEC signatures, and must start using the new key, either through an automated process, or manual intervention. Failure to pick up the new key will result in resolvers becoming completely unavailable to end users. This work presents the "Root Canary", a system to monitor and measure this event from the perspective of validating DNS resolvers for its entire nine-month duration. The system combines three active measurement platforms to have the broadest possible coverage of validating resolvers. Results will be presented in near real-time, to allow the global DNS community to act if problems arise. Furthermore, after the Root KSK rollover concludes in March 2018, we will use the recorded datasets for an in-depth analysis, from which the Internet community can draw lessons for future key rollovers.},

@inproceedings{Diab:2017:CAD:3123878.3131972,
 abstract = {Telco-CDNs are ISP-managed CDNs deployed inside ISP networks. We propose a new content distribution system inside telco-CDN called CAD. In CAD, Content Provider and ISP collaborate to distribute multimedia content to users inside the ISP network. CAD manages both the overlay and underlay of the network to reduce the ISP interdomain traffic, improve the service latency, and minimize the intradomain link utilization. CAD achieves these goals by allowing caching servers to fetch content from other caching servers, and create videos on-demand inside the telco-CDN. We propose an algorithm to calculate the overlay and underlay of the CAD-managed telco-CDN in polynomial time. Compared against the closest approach in the literature, our initial results showed that CAD achieves up to 30% reduction in the interdomain traffic and up to 230% improvement in the service latency, while not increasing the intradomain link utilization.},
