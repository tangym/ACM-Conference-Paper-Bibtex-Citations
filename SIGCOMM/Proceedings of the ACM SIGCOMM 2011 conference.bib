Wireless Rural Extensions (WiRE) is a low-power rural wireless network architecture that provides inexpensive, self-sustainable, and high-bandwidth connectivity. WiRE relies on a high-bandwidth directional wireless backbone with local distribution networks to provide focused IP coverage. WiRE also provides cellular connectivity using OpenBTS-based GSM microcells. It supports a naming and addressing framework that inter-operates with traditional telecom networks and enables a wide range of mobile services on a common IP framework. The entire name network can be built by integrating a range of off-the-shelf components and existing open source tools.},

@article{Rahman:2011:DSA:2043164.2018458,
 abstract = {Distributed systems without a central authority, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, employ incentives to encourage nodes to follow the prescribed protocol. Game theoretic analysis is often used to evaluate incentives in such systems. However, most game-theoretic analyses of distributed systems do not adequately model the repeated interactions of nodes inherent in such systems. We present a game-theoretic analysis of a popular P2P protocol, Bit-Torrent, that models the repeated interactions in such protocols. We also note that an analytical approach for modeling incentives is often infeasible given the complicated nature of most deployed protocols. In order to comprehensively model incentives in complex protocols, we propose a simulation-based method, which we call Design Space Analysis (DSA). DSA provides a tractable analysis of competing protocol variants within a detailed design space. We apply DSA to P2P file swarming systems. With extensive simulations we analyze a wide-range of protocol variants and gain insights into their robustness and performance. To validate these results and to demonstrate the efficacy of DSA, we modify an instrumented BitTorrent client and evaluate protocols discovered using DSA. We show that they yield higher system performance and robustness relative to the reference implementation.},

Many OSNs view this data as a valuable asset that is at the core of their business model. Both OSN users and OSNs have strong incentives to restrict large scale crawls of this data. OSN users want to protect their privacy and OSNs their business interest. Traditional defenses against crawlers involve rate- limiting browsing activity per user account. These defense schemes, however, are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where a crawler creates a large number of fake user accounts. In this paper, we propose Genie, a system that can be deployed by OSN operators to defend against Sybil crawlers. Genie is based on a simple yet powerful insight: the social network itself can be leveraged to defend against Sybil crawlers. We first present Genie's design and then discuss how Genie can limit crawlers while allowing browsing of user profiles by normal users.},

 abstract = {The use of cellular data networks is increasingly popular as network coverage becomes more ubiquitous and many diverse user-contributed mobile applications become available. The growing cellular traffic demand means that cellular network carriers are facing greater challenges to provide users with good network performance and energy efficiency, while protecting networks from potential attacks. To better utilize their limited network resources while securing the network and protecting client devices the carriers have already deployed various network policies that influence traffic behavior. Today, these policies are mostly opaque, though they directly impact application designs and may even introduce network vulnerabilities. We present NetPiculet, the first tool that unveils carriers' NAT and firewall policies by conducting intelligent measurement. By running NetPiculet on the major U.S. cellular providers as well as deploying it as a smartphone application in the wild covering more than 100 cellular ISPs, we identified the key NAT and firewall policies which have direct implications on performance, energy, and security. For example, NAT boxes and firewalls set timeouts for idle TCP connections, which sometimes cause significant energy waste on mobile devices. Although most carriers today deploy sophisticated firewalls, they are still vulnerable to various attacks such as battery draining and denial of service. These findings can inform developers in optimizing the interaction between mobile applications and cellular networks and also guide carriers in improving their network configurations.},

In conjunction with the Federal Communication Commission's study of broadband Internet access in the United States, we study the throughput and latency of network access links using longitudinal measurements from nearly 4,000 gateway devices across 8 ISPs from a deployment of over 4,200 devices. We study the performance users achieve and how various factors ranging from the user's choice of modem to the ISP's traffic shaping policies can affect performance. Our study yields many important findings about the characteristics of existing access networks. Our findings also provide insights into the ways that access network performance should be measured and presented to users, which can help inform ongoing broader efforts to benchmark the performance of access networks.},

 abstract = {Recent studies show that high-power cross-technology interference is becoming a major problem in today's 802.11 networks. Devices like baby monitors and cordless phones can cause a wireless LAN to lose connectivity. The existing approach for dealing with such high-power interferers makes the 802.11 network switch to a different channel; yet the ISM band is becoming increasingly crowded with diverse technologies, and hence many 802.11 access points may not find an interference-free channel. This paper presents TIMO, a MIMO design that enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of high-power cross-technology interference. Unlike existing MIMO designs, however, which require all concurrent transmissions to belong to the same technology, TIMO can exploit MIMO capabilities to decode in the presence of a signal from a different technology, hence enabling diverse technologies to share the same frequency band. We implement a prototype of TIMO in GNURadio-USRP2 and show that it enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of interference from baby monitors, cordless phones, and microwave ovens, transforming scenarios with a complete loss of connectivity to operational networks.},

 abstract = {The 60 GHz wireless technology that is now emerging has the potential to provide dense and extremely fast connectivity at low cost. In this paper, we explore its use to relieve hotspots in oversubscribed data center (DC) networks. By experimenting with prototype equipment, we show that the DC environment is well suited to a deployment of 60GHz links contrary to concerns about interference and link reliability. Using directional antennas, many wireless links can run concurrently at multi-Gbps rates on top-of-rack (ToR) switches. The wired DC network can be used to sidestep several common wireless problems. By analyzing production traces of DC traffic for four real applications, we show that adding a small amount of network capacity in the form of wireless flyways to the wired DC network can improve performance. However, to be of significant value, we find that one hop indirect routing is needed. Informed by our 60GHz experiments and DC traffic analysis, we present a design that uses DC traffic levels to select and adds flyways to the wired DC network. Trace-driven evaluations show that network-limited DC applications with predictable traffic workloads running on a 1:2 oversubscribed network can be sped up by 45% in 95% of the cases, with just one wireless device per ToR switch. With two devices, in 40% of the cases, the performance is identical to that of a non-oversubscribed network.},

 abstract = {Efficient content distribution in large networks comprising datacenters, end hosts, and distributed in-network caches is a difficult problem. Existing systems rely on mechanisms and metrics that fail to effectively utilize all available sources of bandwidth in the network. This paper presents a novel metric, called the Content Propagation Metric (CPM), for quantitatively evaluating the marginal benefit of available bandwidth to competing consumers, enabling efficient utilization of the bandwidth resource. The metric is simple to implement, imposes only a modest overhead, and can be retrofitted easily into existing content distribution systems. We have designed and implemented a high-performance content distribution system, called V-Formation, based on the CPM. The CPM guides V-Formation toward a global allocation of bandwidth that maximizes the aggregate download bandwidth of consumers. Results from a PlanetLab deployment and extensive simulations show that V-Formation achieves high aggregate bandwidth and that the CPM enables hosts to converge quickly on a stable allocation of resources in a wide range of deployment scenarios.},

 abstract = {As the distribution of the video over the Internet becomes main- stream and its consumption moves from the computer to the TV screen, user expectation for high quality is constantly increasing. In this context, it is crucial for content providers to understand if and how video quality affects user engagement and how to best invest their resources to optimize video quality. This paper is a first step towards addressing these questions. We use a unique dataset that spans different content types, including short video on demand (VoD), long VoD, and live content from popular video con- tent providers. Using client-side instrumentation, we measure quality metrics such as the join time, buffering ratio, average bitrate, rendering quality, and rate of buffering events. We quantify user engagement both at a per-video (or view) level and a per-user (or viewer) level. In particular, we find that the percentage of time spent in buffering (buffering ratio) has the largest impact on the user engagement across all types of content. However, the magnitude of this impact depends on the content type, with live content being the most impacted. For example, a 1% increase in buffering ratio can reduce user engagement by more than three minutes for a 90-minute live video event. We also see that the average bitrate plays a significantly more important role in the case of live content than VoD content.},

 abstract = {We describe a synopsis structure, the Difference Digest, that allows two nodes to compute the elements belonging to the set difference in a single round with communication overhead proportional to the size of the difference times the logarithm of the keyspace. While set reconciliation can be done efficiently using logs, logs require overhead for every update and scale poorly when multiple users are to be reconciled. By contrast, our abstraction assumes no prior context and is useful in networking and distributed systems applications such as trading blocks in a peer-to-peer network, and synchronizing link-state databases after a partition. Our basic set-reconciliation method has a similarity with the peeling algorithm used in Tornado codes [6], which is not surprising, as there is an intimate connection between set difference and coding. Beyond set reconciliation, an essential component in our Difference Digest is a new estimator for the size of the set difference that outperforms min-wise sketches [3] for small set differences. Our experiments show that the Difference Digest is more efficient than prior approaches such as Approximate Reconciliation Trees [5] and Characteristic Polynomial Interpolation [17]. We use Difference Digests to implement a generic KeyDiff service in Linux that runs over TCP and returns the sets of keys that differ between machines.},

In this paper we present DOF, a detector that in a single framework accurately estimates all three parameters. DOF builds on the insight that in most wireless protocols, there are hidden repeating patterns in the signals that can be used to construct unique signatures, and accurately estimate signal types and their spectral and spatial parameters. We show via experimental evaluation in an indoor testbed that DOF is robust and accurate, it achieves greater than 85% accuracy even when the SNRs of the detected signals are as low as 0 dB, and even when there are multiple interfering signals present. To demonstrate the benefits of DOF, we design and implement a preliminary prototype of a smart radio that operates on top of DOF, and show experimentally that it provides a 80% increase in throughput over Jello, the best known prior implementation, while causing less than 10% performance drop for co-existing WiFi and Zigbee radios.},

However, while content can be retrieved from many different places, the paths to those places are not equivalent. Indeed, some paths offer better bandwidth while others are less expensive or more stable. In addition, a new range of applications is sensitive to the performance of the paths that carry their traffic. To support this evolution of the Internet, we propose ISP-Driven Informed Path Selection (IDIPS). Any ISP can easily deploy IDIPS to help its customers to select the paths that best meet their requirements in order to reach their content. IDIPS helps in this selection through pro-active measurements and ISP-defined policies. IDIPS is scalable and can support thousands of clients. IDIPS is also flexible and can thus be used by the ISP to optimize its routing decisions to take the performance of its inter-domain links into account.},

 abstract = {Data is the basis of the modern information society. However, recent natural catastrophes have shown that it is not possible to definitively secure a data storage location. Even if the storage location is not destroyed itself the access may quickly become impossible, due to the breakdown of connections or power supply. However, this rarely happens without any warning. While floods have hours or days of warning time, tsunamis usually leave only minutes for reaction and for earthquakes there are only seconds. In such situations, timely evacuation of important data is the key challenge. Consequently, the focus lies on minimizing the time to move away all data from the storage location whereas the actual time to arrival remains less (but still) important. This demonstration presents the dynamic fast send protocol (DFSP), a new bulk data transfer protocol. It employs striping to dynamic intermediate nodes in order to minimize sending time and to utilize the sender's resources to a high extent.},

In many cases, the OLT does not have any packets for the ONU and it goes to sleep again, what supposes a waste of energy. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid ONU that relies on a low-cost and low-energy technology, IEEE 802.15.4, to wake up those ONUs that are going to receive a packet.

 abstract = {Welcome to the 2010 ACM SIGCOMM Conference in New Delhi, India! We are excited to introduce the technical program for the first-ever ACM SIGCOMM conference held in India. This year's program continues SIGCOMM's tradition of presenting outstanding work that breaks new theoretical ground and provides practical insight into modern communication networks. The program committee accepted 33 excellent papers selected from 276 reviewed submissions. The topics range across all aspects of network infrastructure, from the enterprise and data center to wireless, and address problems and opportunities across the network stack from the physical layer to global social networks. Similarly, the papers came from a rich mix of authors from both academia and industry all over the world. Authors from over 30 countries submitted papers, and the final program includes authors from 8 countries and over 40 organizations. We had the distinct pleasure of working with an outstanding technical program committee of 48 members spanning the globe and drawn from both industry and academia. The composition of the TPC was crafted with care, following the guidelines developed over the years with ACM SIGCOMM. Every member of the committee had an equal role throughout, reviewing the same number of papers and participating in the program committee meeting. We are very grateful for their tremendous dedication and hard work. Participating in the SIGCOMM TPC is one of the most intense reviewing activities, as all of the papers are reviewed only by the TPC members. As with other conferences receiving a large number of submissions, the TPC reviewed the submitted papers in two rounds followed by a TPC meeting. Each round resulted in about half of the papers being considered for the next step. In the first round, every paper received at least three reviews. A discussion phase then followed the first round. Based on these first round reviews and subsequent discussions, we assigned at least two additional reviews to papers in a second round. When necessary, we also relied upon the expertise of a small, select group of expert external reviewers in addition to the reviews from the TPC members. In total, the 276 submitted papers received 1,120 reviews. A second discussion phase followed. Based upon the collective reviews and final online discussions, the program committee then met on May 3-4, 2010 for a lively 1.5-day discussion (with all TPC members in attendance) that resulted in the final conference program. The TPC subsequently shepherded all accepted papers, and the authors produced the polished final papers that constitute these proceedings. It is our distinct honor and pleasure to present the best paper for ACM SIGCOMM 2010, "Efficient Error Estimating Coding: Feasibility and Applications," by Binbin Chen, Ziling Zhou, Yuda Zhao and Haifeng Yu from the National University of Singapore. Volunteers from the TPC selected the best paper from a set of six papers nominated based on the merits of their reviews. All TPC members that were not conflicted with the nominated papers were invited to participate in the best paper award selection committee. We sincerely thank Bruce Davie for leading this important process, and are grateful to the TPC members who volunteered for this final task.},

 abstract = {Cluster computing applications like MapReduce and Dryad transfer massive amounts of data between their computation stages. These transfers can have a significant impact on job performance, accounting for more than 50% of job completion times. Despite this impact, there has been relatively little work on optimizing the performance of these data transfers, with networking researchers traditionally focusing on per-flow traffic management. We address this limitation by proposing a global management architecture and a set of algorithms that (1) improve the transfer times of common communication patterns, such as broadcast and shuffle, and (2) allow scheduling policies at the transfer level, such as prioritizing a transfer over other transfers. Using a prototype implementation, we show that our solution improves broadcast completion times by up to 4.5X compared to the status quo in Hadoop. We also show that transfer-level scheduling can reduce the completion time of high-priority transfers by 1.7X.},

EvoArch is based on a few principles about layered network architectures and their evolution in a competitive environment where protocols acquire value based on their higher layer applications and compete with other protocols at the same layer. EvoArch produces an hourglass structure that is similar to the Internet architecture from general initial conditions and in a robust manner. It also suggests a plausible explanation why some protocols, such as TCP or IP, managed to survive much longer than most other protocols at the same layers. Furthermore, it suggests ways to design more competitive new protocols and more evolvable future Internet architectures.},

Most current methods to balance packets over the multiple next hops toward the destination base their decision on a hash computed over selected fields of the packet headers. Because of the non-invertible nature of hash functions, it is hard to determine the values of those fields so as to make the packet follow a specific path in the network. However, several applications might benefit from being able to choose such a path. Therefore, we propose a novel next-hop selection method based on an invertible function. By encoding the selection of successive routers into common fields of packet headers, the proposed method enables end hosts to force their packets to follow a specific path.},

Recently, a Graph Coordinate System, called Orion, has been proposed to estimate shortest-path distances in a scalable way. Orion uses a landmark-based approach, which does not take account of the shortest-path distances between non-landmark nodes in coordinate calculation. Such biased input for the coordinate system cannot characterize the graph structure well. In this paper, we propose Pomelo, which calculates the graph coordinates in a decentralized manner. Every node in Pomelo computes its shortest-path distances to both nearby neighbors and some random distant neighbors. By introducing the novel partial BFS, the computational overhead of Pomelo is tunable. Our experimental results from different representative social graphs show that Pomelo greatly outperforms Orion in estimation accuracy while maintaining the same computational overhead.},

The existing relationship inference algorithms are profoundly based on the valley-free rule and generalize their inference heuristics for both the IPv4 and IPv6 planes, introducing unavoidable inference artifacts. To discover and analyze the Type-of-Relationship (ToR) properties of the IPv6 topology we mine the BGP Communities attribute which provides an unexploited wealth of reliable relationship information. We obtain the actual relationships for 72% of the IPv6 AS links that are visible in the RouteViews and RIPE RIS repositories. Our results show that as many as 13% of AS links that serve both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic have different relationships depending on the IP version. Such relationships are characterized as hybrid. We observe that links with hybrid relationships are present in a large number of IPv6 AS paths. Furthermore, an unusually large portion of IPv6 AS paths violate the valley-free rule, indicating that the global reachability in the IPv6 Internet requires the relaxation of the valley-free rule. Our work highlights the importance of correctly inferring the AS relationships and the need to appreciate the distinct characteristics of IPv6 routing policies.},

However, if experience with IPv6 is any indicator, this will be no easy task. Security concerns alone seem unlikely to provide sufficient local incentive to drive the deployment process forward. Worse yet, the security benefits provided by the S*BGP protocols do not even kick in until a large number of ASes have deployed them. Instead, we appeal to ISPs' interest in increasing revenue-generating traffic. We propose a strategy that governments and industry groups can use to harness ISPs' local business objectives and drive global S*BGP deployment. We evaluate our deployment strategy using theoretical analysis and large-scale simulations on empirical data. Our results give evidence that the market dynamics created by our proposal can transition the majority of the Internet to S*BGP.},

Configuration analysis is limited in that it cannot find bugs in router software, and is harder to generalize across protocols since it must model complex configuration languages and dynamic protocol behavior. This paper studies an alternate approach: diagnosing problems through static analysis of the data plane. This approach can catch bugs that are invisible at the level of configuration files, and simplifies unified analysis of a network across many protocols and implementations. We present Anteater, a tool for checking invariants in the data plane. Anteater translates high-level network invariants into boolean satisfiability problems (SAT), checks them against network state using a SAT solver, and reports counterexamples if violations have been found. Applied to a large university network, Anteater revealed 23 bugs, including forwarding loops and stale ACL rules, with only five false positives. Nine of these faults are being fixed by campus network operators.},

@article{Dixit:2011:EFT:2043164.2018504,
 abstract = {Multi-rooted tree topologies are commonly used to construct high-bandwidth data center network fabrics. In these networks, switches typically rely on equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing techniques to split traffic across multiple paths, such that packets within a flow traverse the same end-to-end path. Unfortunately, since ECMP splits traffic based on flow-granularity, it can cause load imbalance across paths resulting in poor utilization of network resources. More fine-grained traffic splitting techniques are typically not preferred because they can cause packet reordering that can, according to conventional wisdom, lead to severe TCP throughput degradation. In this work, we revisit this fact in the context of regular data center topologies such as fat-tree architectures. We argue that packet-level traffic splitting, where packets of a flow are sprayed through all available paths, would lead to a better load-balanced network, which in turn leads to significantly more balanced queues and much higher throughput compared to ECMP.},

 abstract = {Ubiquity of portable computing devices coupled with wide availability of wireless communication present new impor- tant opportunities for applications involving media-rich content dissemination. However, as access networks become increasingly more heterogeneous, seamless data delivery across internets consisting of a variety of network technology becomes a real challenge. In this demonstration, we showcase a system that enables content dissemination over heterogeneous internets consisting of wired, infrastructure-based and infrastructure-less wireless networks that may be prone to intermittent connectivity. Using an efficient, yet flexible buffer management scheme, we are able to address application-specific performance requirements such as average delay, delivery probability, energy efficiency, etc. Our system uses the Message Delivery in Heterogeneous, Disruption-prone Networks (MeDeHa) [2]) framework to deliver messages across a heterogeneous internet coupled with History-Based Scheduling and Drop (HBSD) buffer management [1] as a way to optimize resources provided by opportunistic networks. MeDeHa, which is described in detail in [2], provides seamless data delivery over interconnecting networks of different types, i.e., infrastructure-based and infrastructure-less networks. MeDeHa's comprehensive approach to bridging infrastructure-based and infrastructureless networks also copes with intermittent connectivity. For this demonstration, we showcase a "complete stack" solution featuring, from to top to bottom, the DTN2 "bundle" layer, HBSD as an "external router" to DTN2, and MeDeHa, which handles message delivery. We have implemented, on a Linux-based testbed, (i) the MeDeHa framework, (ii) the HBSD [3] external router for the DTN2 [4] architecture.},

 abstract = {Large datacenter operators with sites at multiple locations dimension their key resources according to the peak demand of the geographic area that each site covers. The demand of specific areas follows strong diurnal patterns with high peak to valley ratios that result in poor average utilization across a day. In this paper, we show how to rescue unutilized bandwidth across multiple datacenters and backbone networks and use it for non-real-time applications, such as backups, propagation of bulky updates, and migration of data. Achieving the above is non-trivial since leftover bandwidth appears at different times, for different durations, and at different places in the world. For this purpose, we have designed, implemented, and validated NetStitcher, a system that employs a network of storage nodes to stitch together unutilized bandwidth, whenever and wherever it exists. It gathers information about leftover resources, uses a store-and-forward algorithm to schedule data transfers, and adapts to resource fluctuations. We have compared NetStitcher with other bulk transfer mechanisms using both a testbed and a live deployment on a real CDN. Our testbed evaluation shows that NetStitcher outperforms all other mechanisms and can rescue up to five times additional datacenter bandwidth thus making it a valuable tool for datacenter providers. Our live CDN deployment demonstrates that our solution can perform large data transfers at a much lower cost than naive end-to-end or store-and-forward schemes.},

It can simplify network and traffic management in enterprise and data center environments, because it enables flow-level control over Ethernet switching and provides global visibility of the flows in the network. However, such fine-grained control and visibility comes with costs: the switch-implementation costs of involving the switch's control-plane too often and the distributed-system costs of involving the OpenFlow controller too frequently, both on flow setups and especially for statistics-gathering. In this paper, we analyze these overheads, and show that OpenFlow's current design cannot meet the needs of high-performance networks. We design and evaluate DevoFlow, a modification of the OpenFlow model which gently breaks the coupling between control and global visibility, in a way that maintains a useful amount of visibility without imposing unnecessary costs. We evaluate DevoFlow through simulations, and find that it can load-balance data center traffic as well as fine-grained solutions, without as much overhead: DevoFlow uses 10--53 times fewer flow table entries at an average switch, and uses 10--42 times fewer control messages.},

Although both enterprise and residential networks are rapidly adopting these services, there is little systematic work on the design challenges and trade-offs ISPs face in providing them. The goal of our paper is to understand the complexity underlying the layer-3 design of services and to highlight potential factors that hinder their introduction, evolution and management. Using daily snapshots of configuration and device metadata collected from a tier-1 ISP, we examine the logical dependencies and special cases in device configurations for five different network-based services. We find: (1) the design of the core data-plane is usually service-agnostic and simple, but the control-planes for different services become more complex as services evolve; (2) more crucially, the configuration at the service edge inevitably becomes more complex over time, potentially hindering key management issues such as service upgrades and troubleshooting; and (3) there are key service-specific issues that also contribute significantly to the overall design complexity. Thus, the high prevalent complexity could impede the adoption and growth of network-based services. We show initial evidence that some of the complexity can be mitigated systematically.},

 abstract = {The latest large-scale data centers offer higher aggregate bandwidth and robustness by creating multiple paths in the core of the net- work. To utilize this bandwidth requires different flows take different paths, which poses a challenge. In short, a single-path transport seems ill-suited to such networks. We propose using Multipath TCP as a replacement for TCP in such data centers, as it can effectively and seamlessly use available bandwidth, giving improved throughput and better fairness on many topologies. We investigate what causes these benefits, teasing apart the contribution of each of the mechanisms used by MPTCP. Using MPTCP lets us rethink data center networks, with a different mindset as to the relationship between transport protocols, rout- ing and topology. MPTCP enables topologies that single path TCP cannot utilize. As a proof-of-concept, we present a dual-homed variant of the FatTree topology. With MPTCP, this outperforms FatTree for a wide range of workloads, but costs the same. In existing data centers, MPTCP is readily deployable leveraging widely deployed technologies such as ECMP. We have run MPTCP on Amazon EC2 and found that it outperforms TCP by a factor of three when there is path diversity. But the biggest benefits will come when data centers are designed for multipath transports.},

@article{Valancius:2011:MTP:2043164.2018459,
 abstract = {ISPs are increasingly selling "tiered" contracts, which offer Internet connectivity to wholesale customers in bundles, at rates based on the cost of the links that the traffic in the bundle is traversing. Although providers have already begun to implement and deploy tiered pricing contracts, little is known about how to structure them. While contracts that sell connectivity on finer granularities improve market efficiency, they are also more costly for ISPs to implement and more difficult for customers to understand. Our goal is to analyze whether current tiered pricing practices in the wholesale transit market yield optimal profits for ISPs and whether better bundling strategies might exist. In the process, we deliver two contributions: 1) we develop a novel way of mapping traffic and topology data to a demand and cost model, and 2) we fit this model on three large real-world networks: an European transit ISP, a content distribution network, and an academic research network, and run counterfactuals to evaluate the effects of different bundling strategies. Our results show that the common ISP practice of structuring tiered contracts according to the cost of carrying the traffic flows (e.g., offering a discount for traffic that is local) can be suboptimal and that dividing contracts based on both traffic demand and the cost of carrying it into only three or four tiers yields near-optimal profit for the ISP.},

In these attacks, adversaries induce honest nodes to exhibit undesirable behaviors by misrepresenting their intent or network conditions. Our method is based on a novel combination of static analysis with symbolic execution and dynamic analysis with concrete execution. The former finds code paths that are likely vulnerable, and the latter emulates adversarial actions that lead to effective attacks. Our method is precise (i.e., no false positives) and we show that it scales to complex protocol implementations. We apply it to four diverse protocols, including TCP, the 802.11 MAC, ECN, and SCTP, and show that it is able to find all manipulation attacks that have been previously reported for these protocols. We also find a previously unreported attack for SCTP. This attack is a variant of a TCP attack but must be mounted differently in SCTP because of subtle semantic differences between the two protocols.},

@article{Otto:2011:BME:2043164.2018450,
 abstract = {A thorough understanding of the network impact of emerging large-scale distributed systems -- where traffic flows and what it costs -- must encompass users' behavior, the traffic they generate and the topology over which that traffic flows. In the case of BitTorrent, however, previous studies have been limited by narrow perspectives that restrict such analysis. This paper presents a comprehensive view of BitTorrent, using data from a representative set of 500,000 users sampled over a two year period, located in 169 countries and 3,150 networks. This unique perspective captures unseen trends and reveals several unexpected features of the largest peer-to-peer system. For instance, over the past year total BitTorrent traffic has increased by 12%, driven by 25% increases in per-peer hourly download volume despite a 10% decrease in the average number of online peers. We also observe stronger diurnal usage patterns and, surprisingly given the bandwidth-intensive nature of the application, a close alignment between these patterns and overall traffic. Considering the aggregated traffic across access links, this has potential implications on BitTorrent-associated costs for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Using data from a transit ISP, we find a disproportionately large impact on a commonly used burstable (95th-percentile) billing model. Last, when examining BitTorrent traffic's paths, we find that for over half its users, most network traffic never reaches large transit networks, but is instead carried by small transit ISPs. This raises questions on the effectiveness of most in-network monitoring systems to capture trends on peer-to-peer traffic and further motivates our approach.},

 abstract = {The soft real-time nature of large scale web applications in today's datacenters, combined with their distributed workflow, leads to deadlines being associated with the datacenter application traffic. A network flow is useful, and contributes to application throughput and operator revenue if, and only if, it completes within its deadline. Today's transport pro- tocols (TCP included), given their Internet origins, are agnostic to such flow deadlines. Instead, they strive to share network resources fairly. We show that this can hurt application performance. Motivated by these observations, and other (previously known) deficiencies of TCP in the datacenter environment, this paper presents the design and implementation of D3, a deadline-aware control protocol that is customized for the datacenter environment. D3 uses explicit rate control to apportion bandwidth according to flow deadlines. Evaluation from a 19-node, two-tier datacenter testbed shows that D3, even without any deadline information, easily outper- forms TCP in terms of short flow latency and burst tolerance. Further, by utilizing deadline information, D3 effectively doubles the peak load that the datacenter network cansupport.},

Does the global vantage point in NOX make the implementation easier than the traditional method of implementing it on every switch, embedded in the data plane? We implemented every major feature of MPLS-TE and MPLS-VPN in just 2,000 lines of code, compared to much larger lines of code in the more traditional approach, such as Quagga-MPLS. Because NOX maintains a consistent, up-to-date topology map, the MPLS control plane features are quite simple to implement. And its simplicity makes it easy to extend: We have easily added several new features; something a network operator could do to customize their network to meet their customers' needs.

 abstract = {Welcome to the 2012 ACM SIGCOMM Conference in Helsinki, Finland, which is a wonderful location and incidentally is the farthest north that the conference has ventured to in its long history! It is our pleasure to introduce the technical program of the conference. This year's program continues SIGCOMM's tradition of presenting outstanding work that suggests new areas of research in networking. The program committee accepted 31 papers selected from 235 submissions. We felt it was important to have a broad view of networking; this allowed us to choose papers on such diverse topics as on-chip networking, key-value stores, and measuring click spam. While this year's program continues to reflect a recent renaissance in data centers and wireless, traditional topics such as routing, QoS, and measurement are also well represented. The papers came from a rich mix of authors from both academia and industry across the globe. Authors from organizations in around 25 countries submitted papers, and the final program includes authors from over 30 organizations in 8 countries. It was a delight to work with a terrific technical program committee of 49 members from all over the world and including distinguished academic and industrial researchers. We chose the PC with care, trying to balance experience with youth, and recognizing authors who have made consistent technical contributions in SIGCOMM and other top conferences, while ensuring broad technical area coverage and a wide geographic representation. Members of the PC were drawn from 9 countries in 4 continents, with a quarter of the PC comprising first-time members, both relatively young networking researchers and experienced researchers from sister areas such as operating systems and mobile systems. We are grateful for the insight and care that our PC displayed, working hard and responding to our every request. We are also delighted to report that the first-time PC members were a wonderful addition, enriching the PC with their insights and exhibiting a high degree of diligence and professionalism. We continued the tradition of a two-round review process, with a first round of three reviews for each paper. Around half the submitted papers were chosen for the second round, which then generated three more reviews. After the second round and a subsequent online discussion phase, around 60 papers were chosen for discussion at the PC meeting. As chairs we went less by numerical score in order to decide which paper to advance than by the actual reviews, realizing that numerical scores vary widely with reviewers. In a few cases, we sought external reviewers to obtain an expert opinion. The PC meeting was held in San Jose, CA, USA, over a day and a half. While all of the papers in the discussion set were discussed and had tentative decisions made on day 1, the half-day on day 2 allowed plenty of time for the PC to revisit, and in some cases reverse, the decisions made on day 1, and even bring up papers for discussion papers that hadn't been shortlisted for discussion on day 1. Despite following the traditional process, this year's review process was marked by two new mechanisms. First, we reintroduced an author response phase, which had last been tried in SIGCOMM over a decade ago. To make the author response effective, we formulated a careful set of instructions, including illustrative examples, to help make the author responses more factual and effective. The author response phase was intended partly to reduce the possibility of mistaken reviews, but also to promote an approximation to the healthy dialog between authors and reviewers inherent in the classical journal process. We were delighted with the quality of the author responses we saw even with (eventually) rejected papers: respectful, factual, and insightful. The responses were all considered as part of the PC discussion, and some indeed changed the reviewers' minds. Second, the entire PC made an attempt to provide constructive reviews, emphasizing the positive, and suggesting where the paper could be improved. To make explicit the value we placed on good reviews and recognize exceptional contributions in this regard by PC members, we instituted 3 Outstanding Reviewer Awards, which will be presented at the conference. The selection of the award papers started with nominations made by PC members. We as the PC chairs shortlisted 5 of the nominated papers and passed these on to an awards committee chaired by David Wetherall and also comprising T.V. Lakshman, Dave Levin, and Ratul Mahajan, all members of the PC. We are grateful to the members of the awards committee for conducting a thorough process and sending us their selections in quick time. It is a pleasure to present the Best Paper Award for ACM SIGCOMM 2012 to the paper titled "Multi-Resource Fair Queueing for Packet Processing" by Ali Ghodsi, Vyas Sekar, Matei Zaharia, and Ion Stoica, and the Best Student Paper Award to the paper titled "Picasso: Flexible RF and Spectrum Slicing" by Steven Hong, Jeff Mehlman, and Sachin Katti. For the Outstanding Reviewer Awards, we, the PC chairs, made the selections based on the quality and timeliness of reviewing, participation in the online and PC meeting discussions, and the willingness to go the extra mile when needed. It was challenging for us to make a selection from among the many PC members who contributed so strongly, but after careful thought, it is our pleasure to recognize Aditya Akella, Matt Caesar, and Dave Levin with the Outstanding Reviewer Awards for SIGCOMM 2012. Congratulations to all of the award winners, authors as well as reviewers.},

In such networks, not all administrative domains will generate information that an application can trust and many administrative domains may have restrictive policies on disclosing network information. Thus, both the trustworthiness and accessibility of network information pose obstacles to effective reasoning. NetQuery employs trustworthy computing techniques to facilitate reasoning about the trustworthiness of information contained in the knowledge plane while preserving confidentiality guarantees for operator data. By characterizing information disclosure between operators, NetQuery enables remote verification of advertised claims and contractual stipulations; this enables new applications because network guarantees can span administrative boundaries. We have implemented NetQuery, built several NetQuery-enabled devices, and deployed applications for cloud datacenters, enterprise networks, and the Internet. Simulations, testbed experiments, and a deployment on a departmental network indicate NetQuery can support hundreds of thousands of operations per second and can thus scale to large ISPs.},

 abstract = {Recent papers have shown that wire-speed packet processing is feasible in software even at 10~Gbit/s, but the result has been achieved taking direct control of the network controllers to cut down OS and device driver overheads. In this paper we show how to achieve similar performance in safer conditions on standard operating systems. As in some other proposals, our framework, called netmap, maps packet buffers into the process' memory space; but unlike other proposals, any operation that may affect the state of the hardware is filtered by the OS. This protects the system from crashes induced by misbehaving programs, and simplifies the use of the API. Our tests show that netmap takes as little as 90 clock cycles to move one packet between the wire and the application, almost one order of magnitude less than using the standard OS path. A single core at 1.33~GHz can send or receive packets at wire speed on 10~Gbit/s links (14.8~Mpps), with very good scalability in the number of cores and clock speed. At least three factors contribute to this performance: i) no overhead for encapsulation and metadata management; ii) no per-packet system calls and data copying (ioctl()s are still required, but involve no copying and their cost is amortized over a batch of packets); iii) much simpler device driver operation, because buffers have a plain and simple format that requires},

 abstract = {As Internet service providers increasingly implement and impose "usage caps", consumers need better ways to help them understand and control how devices in the home use up the available network resources or available capacity. Towards this goal, we will demonstrate a system that allows users to monitor and manage their usage caps. The system uses the BISMark firmware running on network gateways to collect usage statistics and report them to a logically centralized controller, which displays usage information. The controller allows users to specify policies about how different people, devices, and applications should consume the usage cap; it implements and enforces these policies via a secure OpenFlow control channel to each gateway device. The demonstration will show various use cases, such as limiting the usage of a particular application, visualizing usage statistics, and allowing users within a single household to "trade" caps with one another.},

@article{Gollakota:2011:THY:2043164.2018438,
 abstract = {Wireless communication has become an intrinsic part of modern implantable medical devices (IMDs). Recent work, however, has demonstrated that wireless connectivity can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality of IMDs' transmitted data or to send unauthorized commands to IMDs---even commands that cause the device to deliver an electric shock to the patient. The key challenge in addressing these attacks stems from the difficulty of modifying or replacing already-implanted IMDs. Thus, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of protecting an implantable device from such attacks without modifying the device itself. We present a physical-layer solution that delegates the security of an IMD to a personal base station called the shield. The shield uses a novel radio design that can act as a jammer-cum-receiver. This design allows it to jam the IMD's messages, preventing others from decoding them while being able to decode them itself. It also allows the shield to jam unauthorized commands---even those that try to alter the shield's own transmissions. We implement our design in a software radio and evaluate it with commercial IMDs. We find that it effectively provides confidentiality for private data and protects the IMD from unauthorized commands.},

Currently, each home service requires the installation of a separate physical box (for instance, the NetFlix box or IPTV set-top-boxes). Instead, we argue for deploying a single box in the home that is powerful and flexible enough to host a variety of home services. In addition, this box is managed by the Internet Service provider and is able to provide service guarantees. We call such a box a service-hosting gateway (SHG), as it combines the functionalities of the home gateway managed by the network service provider with the capability of hosting services. Isolation between such services is ensured by virtualization. We demonstrate a prototype of our (SHG). It is based on the hardware platform that will be used for future home gateways. We illustrate the features of the SHG with multiple use cases ranging from simple service deployment scenarios to complex media distribution services and home automation features.},

The key findings of our study are that (1) data center networks show high reliability, (2) commodity switches such as ToRs and AggS are highly reliable, (3) load balancers dominate in terms of failure occurrences with many short-lived software related faults,(4) failures have potential to cause loss of many small packets such as keep alive messages and ACKs, and (5) network redundancy is only 40% effective in reducing the median impact of failure.},

 abstract = {The shared nature of the network in today's multi-tenant datacenters implies that network performance for tenants can vary significantly. This applies to both production datacenters and cloud environments. Network performance variability hurts application performance which makes tenant costs unpredictable and causes provider revenue loss. Motivated by these factors, this paper makes the case for extending the tenant-provider interface to explicitly account for the network. We argue this can be achieved by providing tenants with a virtual network connecting their compute instances. To this effect, the key contribution of this paper is the design of virtual network abstractions that capture the trade-off between the performance guarantees offered to tenants, their costs and the provider revenue. To illustrate the feasibility of virtual networks, we develop Oktopus, a system that implements the proposed abstractions. Using realistic, large-scale simulations and an Oktopus deployment on a 25-node two-tier testbed, we demonstrate that the use of virtual networks yields significantly better and more predictable tenant performance. Further, using a simple pricing model, we find that the our abstractions can reduce tenant costs by up to 74% while maintaining provider revenue neutrality.},

 abstract = {Network-wide migrations of a running network, such as the replacement of a routing protocol or the modification of its configuration, can improve the performance, scalability, manageability, and security of the entire network. However, such migrations are an important source of concerns for network operators as the reconfiguration campaign can lead to long and service-affecting outages. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses the problem of seamlessly modifying the configuration of commonly used link-state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP). We illustrate the benefits of our methodology by considering several migration scenarios, including the addition or the removal of routing hierarchy in an existing IGP and the replacement of one IGP with another. We prove that a strict operational ordering can guarantee that the migration will not create IP transit service outages. Although finding a safe ordering is NP complete, we describe techniques which efficiently find such an ordering and evaluate them using both real-world and inferred ISP topologies. Finally, we describe the implementation of a provisioning system which automatically performs the migration by pushing the configurations on the routers in the appropriate order, while monitoring the entire migration process.},

 abstract = {Access networks include modems, home gateways, and DSL Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs), and are responsible for 70-80% of total network-based energy consumption. In this paper, we take an in-depth look at the problem of greening access networks, identify root problems, and propose practical solutions for their user- and ISP-parts. On the user side, the combination of continuous light traffic and lack of alternative paths condemns gateways to being powered most of the time despite having Sleep-on-Idle (SoI) capabilities. To address this, we introduce Broadband Hitch-Hiking (BH2), that takes advantage of the overlap of wireless networks to aggregate user traffic in as few gateways as possible. In current urban settings BH2 can power off 65-90% of gateways. Powering off gateways permits the remaining ones to synchronize at higher speeds due to reduced crosstalk from having fewer active lines. Our tests reveal speedup up to 25%. On the ISP side, we propose introducing simple inexpensive switches at the distribution frame for batching active lines to a subset of cards letting the remaining ones sleep. Overall, our results show an 80% energy savings margin in access networks. The combination of B2 and switching gets close to this margin, saving 66% on average.},

When the number of paths is large, the usual traceroute based approach misses many path changes because it probes all paths equally. Based on empirical observations, we argue that monitors can optimize probing according to the likelihood of path changes. We design a simple predictor of path changes using a nearest neighbor model. Although predicting path changes is not very accurate, we show that it can be used to improve probe targeting. Our path tracking method, called DTrack, detects up to two times more path changes than traditional probing, with lower detection delay, as well as providing complete load-balancer information.},

Cloud-based TRE needs to apply a judicious use of cloud resources so that the bandwidth cost reduction combined with the additional cost of TRE computation and storage would be optimized. PACK's main advantage is its capability of offloading the cloud-server TRE effort to end-clients, thus minimizing the processing costs induced by the TRE algorithm. Unlike previous solutions, PACK does not require the server to continuously maintain clients' status. This makes PACK very suitable for pervasive computation environments that combine client mobility and server migration to maintain cloud elasticity. PACK is based on a novel TRE technique, which allows the client to use newly received chunks to identify previously received chunk chains, which in turn can be used as reliable predictors to future transmitted chunks. We present a fully functional PACK implementation, transparent to all TCP-based applications and network devices. Finally, we analyze PACK benefits for cloud users, using traffic traces from various sources.},

It has been our pleasure to oversee the tremendous efforts volunteered by our technical program committee and other individuals in shaping this year's technical program. We hope that you will find the papers selected for the technical program stimulating and thought-provoking, and that you enjoy the conference! SIGCOMM 2011 received 223 submissions, and we accepted 32 papers, for an acceptance ratio of 14%. This represents a modest drop over the number of submissions from previous years. We received submissions from authors in at least 36 countries, and the final program reflects the significant geographical diversity across submissions, with authors representing 12 different countries and 44 distinct institutions. The SIGCOMM 2011 TPC comprised 50 members from academia and industry, reflecting the diversity of our community. The TPC members' research interests span the wide range of topics present in this year's submissions and accepted papers. The members of the TPC wrote at least three first-round reviews for all 223 submissions, as well as three or more second-round reviews for the top 101 papers. Thus, we had at least 6 reviews for each of the 70 papers that we discussed in the TPC meeting. Most second-round papers received significant online discussion between PC members prior to the TPC meeting, and in some cases we solicited additional reviews from external topic experts. In total, the submissions received over 1000 written reviews. Reviewing was double-blind, and was subject to a strict conflict-of-interest policy. PC members with potential conflicts of interest were excluded from all discussions of the relevant papers. Both of the TPC co-chairs were authors of submissions; these reviews were handled entirely outside of the online review system, so as to guarantee reviewer anonymity. Almost all of the TPC members attended the TPC meeting in Boston in person, for 1.5 days of energetic discussion. Those who were not able to attend in person participated via a telephone conference. We strove, as TPC chairs, to ensure that all 70 papers received full and fair discussion, and we encouraged the TPC to consider prioritizing "appropriately risky" papers over otherwise comparable "correct but boring" papers when there was a choice. Each of the 32 accepted papers was shepherded by a member of the TPC, to help the authors improve their final versions.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of Strider, a system that automatically achieves almost the optimal rate adaptation without incurring any overhead. The key component in Strider is a novel code that has two important properties: it is rateless and collision-resilient. First, in time-varying wireless channels, Strider's rateless code allows a sender to effectively achieve almost the optimal bitrate, without knowing how the channel state varies. Second, Strider's collision-resilient code allows a receiver to decode both packets from collisions, and achieves the same throughput as the collision-free scheduler. We show via theoretical analysis that Strider achieves Shannon capacity for Gaussian channels, and our empirical evaluation shows that Strider outperforms SoftRate, a state of the art rate adaptation technique by 70% in mobile scenarios and by upto 2.8× in contention scenarios.},

 abstract = {We demonstrate a new ad hoc routing method that can handle transience such as node-mobility, obstructions and node failures. It has controlled management overhead, and is platform-independent (our demo includes phones, routers, and laptops running different operating systems). It achieves reliability and flexibility at the expense of throughput. It is ideal for scenarios where the reliability of connectivity is critical and bandwidth requirements are low. For e.g., disaster relief operations and sensor networks. Along with applications, we exhibit measurements to illustrate the advantages of our approach in dealing with transience.},
