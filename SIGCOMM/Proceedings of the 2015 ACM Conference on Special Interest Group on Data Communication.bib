 abstract = {A significant fraction of Internet traffic is now encrypted and HTTPS will likely be the default in HTTP/2. However, Transport Layer Security (TLS), the standard protocol for encryption in the Internet, assumes that all functionality resides at the endpoints, making it impossible to use in-network services that optimize network resource usage, improve user experience, and protect clients and servers from security threats. Re-introducing in-network functionality into TLS sessions today is done through hacks, often weakening overall security. In this paper we introduce multi-context TLS (mcTLS), which extends TLS to support middleboxes. mcTLS breaks the current "all-or-nothing" security model by allowing endpoints and content providers to explicitly introduce middleboxes in secure end-to-end sessions while controlling which parts of the data they can read or write. We evaluate a prototype mcTLS implementation in both controlled and "live" experiments, showing that its benefits come at the cost of minimal overhead. More importantly, we show that mcTLS can be incrementally deployed and requires only small changes to client, server, and middlebox software.},

 abstract = {The design space for large, multipath datacenter networks is large and complex, and no one design fits all purposes. Network architects must trade off many criteria to design cost-effective, reliable, and maintainable networks, and typically cannot explore much of the design space. We present Condor, our approach to enabling a rapid, efficient design cycle. Condor allows architects to express their requirements as constraints via a Topology Description Language (TDL), rather than having to directly specify network structures. Condor then uses constraint-based synthesis to rapidly generate candidate topologies, which can be analyzed against multiple criteria. We show that TDL supports concise descriptions of topologies such as fat-trees, BCube, and DCell; that we can generate known and novel variants of fat-trees with simple changes to a TDL file; and that we can synthesize large topologies in tens of seconds. We also show that Condor supports the daunting task of designing multi-phase network expansions that can be carried out on live networks.},

@inproceedings{Vasisht:2015:STF:2785956.2790043,
 abstract = {The time-of-flight of a signal captures the time it takes to propagate from a transmitter to a receiver. Time-of-flight is perhaps the most intuitive method for localization using wireless signals. If one can accurately measure the time-of-flight from a transmitter, one can compute the transmitter's distance simply by multiplying the time-of-flight by the speed of light. Today, GPS, the most widely used outdoor localization system, localizes a device using the time-of-flight of radio signals from satellites. However, applying the same concept to indoor localization has proven difficult. Systems for localization in indoor spaces are expected to deliver high accuracy (e.g., a meter or less) using consumer-oriented technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi on one's cellphone). Unfortunately, past work could not measure time-of-flight at such an accuracy on Wi-Fi devices. As a result, over the years, research on accurate indoor positioning has moved towards more complex alternatives such as employing large multi-antenna arrays to compute the angle-of-arrival of the signal. These new techniques have delivered highly accurate indoor localization systems. Despite these advances, time-of-flight based localization has some of the basic desirable features that state-of-the-art indoor localization systems lack. In particular, measuring time-of-flight does not require more than a single antenna on the receiver. In fact, by measuring time-of-flight of a signal to just two antennas, a receiver can intersect the corresponding distances to locate its source. Thus, a receiver can locate a wireless transmitter with no support from the surrounding infrastructure. This is quite unlike current indoor localization systems, which require multiple access points at known locations, to find the distance between a pair of mobile devices. Furthermore, each of these access points need to have many antennas -- far beyond what is supported in commercial Wi-Fi devices. In this demo, we will present Chronos, a system that combines a set of novel algorithms to measure the time-of-flight to sub-nanosecond accuracy on commercial Wi-Fi cards. In particular, we will measure distance/time-of-flight between two devices equipped with commercial Wi-Fi cards, without any support from the infrastructure or environment fingerprinting.},

 abstract = {Debugging faults in complex networks often requires capturing and analyzing traffic at the packet level. In this task, datacenter networks (DCNs) present unique challenges with their scale, traffic volume, and diversity of faults. To troubleshoot faults in a timely manner, DCN administrators must a) identify affected packets inside large volume of traffic; b) track them across multiple network components; c) analyze traffic traces for fault patterns; and d) test or confirm potential causes. To our knowledge, no tool today can achieve both the specificity and scale required for this task. We present Everflow, a packet-level network telemetry system for large DCNs. Everflow traces specific packets by implementing a powerful packet filter on top of "match and mirror" functionality of commodity switches. It shuffles captured packets to multiple analysis servers using load balancers built on switch ASICs, and it sends "guided probes" to test or confirm potential faults. We present experiments that demonstrate Everflow's scalability, and share experiences of troubleshooting network faults gathered from running it for over 6 months in Microsoft's DCNs.},

But the design of a protocol that enables extremely power-efficient radios for harvesting-based sensors as well as high-rate data transfer for data-rich sensors presents a conundrum. In this paper, we present a new {\em fully asymmetric} backscatter communication protocol where nodes blindly transmit data as and when they sense. This model enables fully flexible node designs, from extraordinarily power-efficient backscatter radios that consume barely a few micro-watts to high-throughput radios that can stream at hundreds of Kbps while consuming a paltry tens of micro-watts. The challenge, however, lies in decoding concurrent streams at the reader, which we achieve using a novel combination of time-domain separation of interleaved signal edges, and phase-domain separation of colliding transmissions. We provide an implementation of our protocol, LF-Backscatter, and show that it can achieve an order of magnitude or more improvement in throughput, latency and power over state-of-art alternatives.},

Tracking changes in the DNS over time provides valuable information about the evolution of the Internet's infrastructure. Until now, only one large-scale approach to perform these kinds of measurements existed, passive DNS (pDNS). While pDNS is useful for applications like tracing security incidents, it does not provide sufficient information to reliably track DNS changes over time. We use a complementary approach based on active measurements, which provides a unique, comprehensive dataset on the evolution of DNS over time. Our high-performance infrastructure performs Internet-scale active measurements, currently querying over 50% of the DNS name space on a daily basis. Our infrastructure is designed from the ground up to enable big data analysis approaches on, e.g., a Hadoop cluster.

Traffic matrices naturally possess complex spatiotemporal characteristics, but their proprietary nature means that little data about them is available publicly, and this situation is unlikely to change. Our goal is to develop techniques to synthesize traffic matrices for researchers who wish to test new network applications or protocols. The paucity of available data, and the desire to build a general framework for synthesis that could work in various settings requires a new look at this problem. We show how the principle of maximum entropy can be used to generate a wide variety of traffic matrices constrained by the needs of a particular task, and the available information, but otherwise avoiding hidden assumptions about the data. We demonstrate how the framework encompasses existing models and measurements, and we apply it in a simple case study to illustrate the value.},

Fibbing is expressive, and readily supports flexible load balancing, traffic engineering, and backup routes. Based on high-level forwarding requirements, the Fibbing controller computes a compact augmented topology and injects the fake components through standard routing-protocol messages.

As the interface between the link layer and the physical layer, MAC protocols are often tightly coupled with the underlying physical layer, and need to have extremely small latencies. Implementing a new MAC requires a long time. In fact, very few MACs have ever been implemented, even though dozens of new MAC protocols have been proposed. To enable quick prototyping, we employ the mechanism vs. policy separation to decompose the functionality in the MAC layer and the PHY layer. Built on the separation framework, WiMAC achieves the independence of the software from the hardware, offering a high degree of function reuse and design flexibility. Hence, our platform not only supports easy cross-layer design but also allows protocol changes on the fly. Following the 802.11-like reference design, we demonstrate that deploying a new MAC protocol is quick and simple on the proposed platform through the implementation of the CSMA/CA and CHAIN protocols.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, signatures used for traffic classification are constructed at the byte-level. However, as more and more data-transfer formats of network protocols and applications are encoded at the bit-level, byte-level signatures are losing their effectiveness in traffic classification. In this poster, we creatively construct bit-level signatures by associating the bit-values with their bit-positions in each traffic flow. Furthermore, we present BitMiner, an automated traffic mining tool that can mine application signatures at the most fine-grained bit-level granularity. Our preliminary test on popular peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, e.g. Skype, Google Hangouts, PPTV, eMule, Xunlei and QQDownload, reveals that although they all have no byte-level signatures, there are significant bit-level signatures hidden in their traffic.},

 abstract = {Distributed consensus is fundamental in distributed systems for achieving fault-tolerance. The Paxos algorithm has long dominated this domain, although it has been recently challenged by algorithms such as Raft and Viewstamped Replication Revisited. These algorithms rely on Paxos's original assumptions, unfortunately these assumptions are now at odds with the reality of the modern internet. Our insight is that current consensus algorithms have significant availability issues when deployed outside the well defined context of the datacenter. To illustrate this problem, we developed Coracle, a tool for evaluating distributed consensus algorithms in settings that more accurately represent realistic deployments. We have used Coracle to test two examples of network configurations that contradict the liveness claims of the Raft algorithm. Through the process of exercising these algorithms under more realistic assumptions, we demonstrate wider availability issues faced by consensus algorithms when deployed on real world networks.},

 abstract = {HTTP-based video streaming services have been dominating the global IP traffic over the last few years. Caching of video content reduces the load on the content servers. In the case of Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), for every video the server needs to host multiple representations of the same video file. These individual representations are further broken down into smaller segments. Hence, for each video the server needs to host thousands of segments out of which, the client downloads a subset of the segments. Also, depending on the network conditions, the adaptation scheme used at the client-end might request a different set of video segments (varying in bitrate) for the same video. The caching of DASH videos presents unique challenges. In order to optimize the cache hits and minimize the misses for DASH video streaming services we propose an Adaptation Aware Cache (AAC) framework to determine the segments that are to be prefetched and retained in the cache. In the current scheme, we use bandwidth estimates at the cache server and the knowledge of the rate adaptation scheme used by the client to estimate the next segment requests, thus improving the prefetching at the cache.},

Our solution is based on (i) a two-layer architecture separating connectivity and optimization tasks; and (ii) a centralized optimizer called framework, which translates high-level goals expressed almost in natural language into compliant network configurations. Our evaluation on real and synthetic topologies shows that framework improves the state of the art by (i) achieving better trade-offs for classic goals covered by previous works, (ii) supporting a larger set of goals (refined traffic engineering and service chaining), and (iii) optimizing large ISP networks in few seconds.

 abstract = {As clusters continue to grow in size and complexity, providing scalable and predictable performance is an increasingly important challenge. A crucial roadblock to achieving predictable performance is stragglers, i.e., tasks that take significantly longer than expected to run. At this point, speculative execution has been widely adopted to mitigate the impact of stragglers. However, speculation mechanisms are designed and operated independently of job scheduling when, in fact, scheduling a speculative copy of a task has a direct impact on the resources available for other jobs. In this work, we present Hopper, a job scheduler that is speculation-aware, i.e., that integrates the tradeoffs associated with speculation into job scheduling decisions. We implement both centralized and decentralized prototypes of the Hopper scheduler and show that 50% (66%) improvements over state-of-the-art centralized (decentralized) schedulers and speculation strategies can be achieved through the coordination of scheduling and speculation.},

A key component of a CDN is the mapping system that uses the DNS protocol to route each client's request to a ``proximal'' server that serves the requested content. While traditional mapping systems identify a client using the IP of its name server, we describe our experience in building and rolling-out a novel system called end-user mapping that identifies the client directly by using a prefix of the client's IP address. Using measurements from Akamai's production network during the roll-out, we show that end-user mapping provides significant performance benefits for clients who use public resolvers, including an eight-fold decrease in mapping distance, a two-fold decrease in RTT and content download time, and a 30% improvement in the time-to-first byte. We also quantify the scaling challenges in implementing end-user mapping such as the 8-fold increase in DNS queries. Finally, we show that a CDN with a larger number of deployment locations is likely to benefit more from end-user mapping than a CDN with a smaller number of deployments.},

 abstract = {Many emerging applications and the ubiquitous wireless signals have accelerated the development of Device Free localization (DFL) techniques, which can localize objects without the need to carry any wireless devices. Most traditional DFL methods have a main drawback that as the pre-obtained Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements (i.e., fingerprint) in one area cannot be directly applied to the new area for localization, and the calibration process of each area will result in the human effort exhausting problem. In this paper, we propose FALE, a fine-grained transferring DFL method that can adaptively work in different areas with little human effort and low energy consumption. FALE employs a rigorously designed transferring function to transfer the fingerprint into a projected space, and reuse it across different areas, thus greatly reduce the human effort. On the other hand, FALE can reduce the data volume and energy consumption by taking advantage of the compressive sensing (CS) theory. Extensive real-word experimental results also illustrate the effectiveness of FALE.},

As part of its architecture, the Meraki system has built a database of time-series measurements of wireless link, client, and application behavior for monitoring and debugging purposes. This paper studies an anonymized subset of measurements, containing data from approximately ten thousand radio access points, tens of thousands of links, and 5.6 million clients from one-week periods in January 2014 and January 2015 to provide a deeper understanding of real-world network behavior. This paper observes the following phenomena: wireless network usage continues to grow quickly, driven most by growth in the number of devices connecting to each network. Intermediate link delivery rates are common indoors across a wide range of deployment environments. Typical access points share spectrum with dozens of nearby networks, but the presence of a network on a channel does not predict channel utilization. Most access points see 2.4 GHz channel utilization of 20% or more, with the top decile seeing greater than 50%, and the majority of the channel use contains decodable 802.11 headers.},

 abstract = {A common pattern in the architectures of modern interactive web-services is that of large request fan-outs, where even a single end-user request (task) arriving at an application server triggers tens to thousands of data accesses (sub-tasks) to different stateful backend servers. The overall response time of each task is bottlenecked by the completion time of the slowest sub-task, making such workloads highly sensitive to the tail of latency distribution of the backend tier. The large number of decentralized application servers and skewed workload patterns exacerbate the challenge in addressing this problem. We address these challenges through BetteR Batch (BRB). By carefully scheduling requests in a decentralized and task-aware manner, BRB enables low-latency distributed storage systems to deliver predictable performance in the presence of large request fan-outs. Our preliminary simulation results based on production workloads show that our proposed design is at the 99th percentile latency within 38% of an ideal system model while offering latency improvements over the state-of-the-art by a factor of 2.},

ScaleBricks applies a new, compact lookup structure to route packets directly to the appropriate handling node, without incurring the cost of multiple hops across the internal interconnect. Its lookup structure is many times smaller than the alternative approach of fully replicating a forwarding table onto all nodes. As a result, ScaleBricks is able to improve throughput and latency while simultaneously increasing the total number of flows that can be handled by such a cluster. This architecture is effective in practice: Used to optimize packet forwarding in an existing commercial LTE-to-Internet gateway, it increases the throughput of a four-node cluster by 23%, reduces latency by up to 10%, saves memory, and stores up to 5.7x more entries in the forwarding table.},

First, we show that advances in NIC hardware have made RTT measurement possible with microsecond accuracy, and that these RTTs are sufficient to estimate switch queueing. Then we describe how TIMELY can adjust transmission rates using RTT gradients to keep packet latency low while delivering high bandwidth. We implement our design in host software running over NICs with OS-bypass capabilities. We show using experiments with up to hundreds of machines on a Clos network topology that it provides excellent performance: turning on TIMELY for OS-bypass messaging over a fabric with PFC lowers 99 percentile tail latency by 9X while maintaining near line-rate throughput. Our system also outperforms DCTCP running in an optimized kernel, reducing tail latency by $13$X. To the best of our knowledge, TIMELY is the first delay-based congestion control protocol for use in the datacenter, and it achieves its results despite having an order of magnitude fewer RTT signals (due to NIC offload) than earlier delay-based schemes such as Vegas.},

DMIMO synchronizes transmissions from 4 distributed MIMO transmitters in time, frequency and phase, and performs distributed multi-user beamforming to independent clients. DMIMO is built on top of a Zynq hardware platform integrated with an FMCOMMS2 RF front end. The platform implements a custom 802.11n compatible MIMO PHY layer which is augmented with a lightweight distributed synchronization engine. The demonstration shows the received constellation points, channels, and effective data throughput at each client. It also shows how these vary as a function of interference, the timeliness of channel feedback, and the transmission rates used by the different transmitters.},

 abstract = {Designing scalable and cost-effective data center interconnect architectures based on electrical packet switches is challenging. To overcome this challenge, researchers have tried to harness the advantages of optics in data center environment. This has resulted in exploration of hybrid switching architectures that contains an optical circuit switch to serve long bursts of traffic along with an electrical packet switch serving short bursts of traffic. The performance of such hybrid switching architectures in data center is dependent on the schedulers. Building hybrid schedulers is challenging because of varying properties of data center traffic, increasing network demands, requirements imposed by hybrid network architecture etc. Slow schedulers can negatively impact the performance of the data center network because of poor resource utilization. With future demands, this problem is going to escalate motivating the need for faster schedulers. One approach to do this would be to use a hardware based scheduler. In this paper we propose a framework that can be used to explore and evaluate hardware based hybrid schedulers.},

 abstract = {Live video delivery is expected to reach a peak of 50 Tbps this year. This surging popularity is fundamentally changing the Internet video delivery landscape. CDNs must meet users' demands for fast join times, high bitrates, and low buffering ratios, while minimizing their own cost of delivery and responding to issues in real-time. Wide-area latency, loss, and failures, as well as varied workloads ("mega-events" to long-tail), make meeting these demands challenging. An analysis of video sessions concluded that a centralized controller could improve user experience, but CDN systems have shied away from such designs due to the difficulty of quickly handling failures, a requirement of both operators and users. We introduce VDN, a practical approach to a video delivery network that uses a centralized algorithm for live video optimization. VDN provides CDN operators with real-time, fine-grained control. It does this in spite of challenges resulting from the wide-area (e.g., state inconsistency, partitions, failures) by using a hybrid centralized+distributed control plane, increasing average bitrate by 1.7x and decreasing cost by 2x in different scenarios.},

Measuring censorship is challenging: it requires continual measurement of reachability to many target sites from diverse vantage points. Amassing suitable vantage points for longitudinal measurement is difficult; existing systems have achieved only small, short-lived deployments. We observe, however, that most Internet users access content via Web browsers, and the very nature of Web site design allows browsers to make requests to domains with different origins than the main Web page. We present Encore, a system that harnesses cross-origin requests to measure Web filtering from a diverse set of vantage points without requiring users to install custom software, enabling longitudinal measurements from many vantage points. We explain how Encore induces Web clients to perform cross-origin requests that measure Web filtering, design a distributed platform for scheduling and collecting these measurements, show the feasibility of a global-scale deployment with a pilot study and an analysis of potentially censored Web content, identify several cases of filtering in six months of measurements, and discuss ethical concerns that would arise with widespread deployment.},

We focus on the problem of routing and congestion control across the rack's network, and find that high path diversity in rack topologies, in combination with workload diversity across it, means that traditional solutions are inadequate. We introduce R2C2, a network stack for rack-scale computers that provides flexible and efficient routing and congestion control. R2C2 leverages the fact that the scale of rack topologies allows for low-overhead broadcasting to ensure that all nodes in the rack are aware of all network flows. We thus achieve rate-based congestion control without any probing; each node independently determines the sending rate for its flows while respecting the provider's allocation policies. For routing, nodes dynamically choose the routing protocol for each flow in order to maximize overall utility. Through a prototype deployed across a rack emulation platform and a packet-level simulator, we show that R2C2 achieves very low queuing and high throughput for diverse and bursty workloads, and that routing flexibility can provide significant throughput gains.},

First, multi-stage Clos topologies built from commodity switch silicon can support cost-effective deployment of building-scale networks. Second, much of the general, but complex, decentralized network routing and management protocols supporting arbitrary deployment scenarios were overkill for single-operator, pre-planned datacenter networks. We built a centralized control mechanism based on a global configuration pushed to all datacenter switches. Third, modular hardware design coupled with simple, robust software allowed our design to also support inter-cluster and wide-area networks.

 abstract = {Electronic toll collection transponders, e.g., E-ZPass, are a widely-used wireless technology. About 70% to 89% of the cars in US have these devices, and some states plan to make them mandatory. As wireless devices however, they lack a basic function: a MAC protocol that prevents collisions. Hence, today, they can be queried only with directional antennas in isolated spots. However, if one could interact with e-toll transponders anywhere in the city despite collisions, it would enable many smart applications. For example, the city can query the transponders to estimate the vehicle flow at every intersection. It can also localize the cars using their wireless signals, and detect those that run a red-light. The same infrastructure can also deliver smart street-parking, where a user parks anywhere on the street, the city localizes his car, and automatically charges his account. This paper presents Caraoke, a networked system for delivering smart services using e-toll transponders. Our design operates with existing unmodified transponders, allowing for applications that communicate with, localize, and count transponders, despite wireless collisions. To do so, Caraoke exploits the structure of the transponders' signal and its properties in the frequency domain. We built Caraoke reader into a small PCB that harvests solar energy and can be easily deployed on street lamps. We also evaluated Caraoke on four streets on our campus and demonstrated its capabilities.},

In this paper, we study the characteristics and implications of infrastructure sharing by analyzing the long-haul fiber-optic network in the US. We start by using fiber maps provided by tier-1 ISPs and major cable providers to construct a map of the long-haul US fiber-optic infrastructure. We also rely on previously under-utilized data sources in the form of public records from federal, state, and municipal agencies to improve the fidelity of our map. We quantify the resulting map's connectivity characteristics and confirm a clear correspondence between long-haul fiber-optic, roadway, and railway infrastructures. Next, we examine the prevalence of high-risk links by mapping end-to-end paths resulting from large-scale traceroute campaigns onto our fiber-optic infrastructure map. We show how both risk and latency (i.e., propagation delay) can be reduced by deploying new links along previously unused transportation corridors and rights-of-way. In particular, focusing on a subset of high-risk links is sufficient to improve the overall robustness of the network to failures. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings on issues related to performance, net neutrality, and policy decision-making.},

 abstract = {WAN bandwidth remains a constrained resource that is economically infeasible to substantially overprovision. Hence, it is important to allocate capacity according to service priority and based on the incremental value of additional allocation. For example, it may be the highest priority for one service to receive 10Gb/s of bandwidth but upon reaching such an allocation, incremental priority may drop sharply favoring allocation to other services. Motivated by the observation that individual flows with fixed priority may not be the ideal basis for bandwidth allocation, we present the design and implementation of Bandwidth Enforcer (BwE), a global, hierarchical bandwidth allocation infrastructure. BwE supports: i) service-level bandwidth allocation following prioritized bandwidth functions where a service can represent an arbitrary collection of flows, ii)independent allocation and delegation policies according to user-defined hierarchy, all accounting for a global view of bandwidth and failure conditions, iii) multi-path forwarding common in traffic-engineered networks, and iv) a central administrative point to override (perhaps faulty) policy during exceptional conditions. BwE has delivered more service efficient bandwidth utilization and simpler management in production for multiple years.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we introduce MMPTCP, a novel transport protocol which aims at unifying the way data is transported in data centres. MMPTCP runs in two phases; initially, it randomly scatters packets in the network under a single congestion window exploiting all available paths. This is beneficial to latency-sensitive flows. During the second phase, MMPTCP runs in Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) mode, which has been shown to be very efficient for long flows. Initial evaluation shows that our approach significantly improves short flow completion times while providing high throughput for long flows and high overall network utilisation.},

We identify three key requirements for such predictability: guaranteed network bandwidth, guaranteed packet delay and guaranteed burst allowance. We present Silo, a system that offers these guarantees in multi-tenant datacenters. Silo leverages the tight coupling between bandwidth and delay: controlling tenant bandwidth leads to deterministic bounds on network queuing delay. Silo builds upon network calculus to place tenant VMs with competing requirements such that they can coexist. A novel hypervisor-based policing mechanism achieves packet pacing at sub-microsecond granularity, ensuring tenants do not exceed their allowances. We have implemented a Silo prototype comprising a VM placement manager and a Windows filter driver. Silo does not require any changes to applications, guest OSes or network switches. We show that Silo can ensure predictable message latency for cloud applications while imposing low overhead.},

 abstract = {User-perceived quality-of-experience (QoE) is critical in Internet video applications as it impacts revenues for content providers and delivery systems. Given that there is little support in the network for optimizing such measures, bottlenecks could occur anywhere in the delivery system. Consequently, a robust bitrate adaptation algorithm in client-side players is critical to ensure good user experience. Previous studies have shown key limitations of state-of-art commercial solutions and proposed a range of heuristic fixes. Despite the emergence of several proposals, there is still a distinct lack of consensus on: (1) How best to design this client-side bitrate adaptation logic (e.g., use rate estimates vs. buffer occupancy); (2) How well specific classes of approaches will perform under diverse operating regimes (e.g., high throughput variability); or (3) How do they actually balance different QoE objectives (e.g., startup delay vs. rebuffering). To this end, this paper makes three key technical contributions. First, to bring some rigor to this space, we develop a principled control-theoretic model to reason about a broad spectrum of strategies. Second, we propose a novel model predictive control algorithm that can optimally combine throughput and buffer occupancy information to outperform traditional approaches. Third, we present a practical implementation in a reference video player to validate our approach using realistic trace-driven emulations.},

 abstract = {Large cloud service providers have invested in increasingly larger datacenters to house the computing infrastructure required to support their services. Accordingly, researchers and industry practitioners alike have focused a great deal of effort designing network fabrics to efficiently interconnect and manage the traffic within these datacenters in performant yet efficient fashions. Unfortunately, datacenter operators are generally reticent to share the actual requirements of their applications, making it challenging to evaluate the practicality of any particular design. Moreover, the limited large-scale workload information available in the literature has, for better or worse, heretofore largely been provided by a single datacenter operator whose use cases may not be widespread. In this work, we report upon the network traffic observed in some of Facebook's datacenters. While Facebook operates a number of traditional datacenter services like Hadoop, its core Web service and supporting cache infrastructure exhibit a number of behaviors that contrast with those reported in the literature. We report on the contrasting locality, stability, and predictability of network traffic in Facebook's datacenters, and comment on their implications for network architecture, traffic engineering, and switch design.},

 abstract = {There are several mechanisms by which users can gain insight into where their packets have gone, but no mechanisms allow users undeniable proof that their packets did not traverse certain parts of the world while on their way to or from another host. This paper introduces the problem of finding "proofs of avoidance": evidence that the paths taken by a packet and its response avoided a user-specified set of "forbidden" geographic regions. Proving that something did not happen is often intractable, but we demonstrate a low-overhead proof structure built around the idea of what we call "alibis": relays with particular timing constraints that, when upheld, would make it impossible to traverse both the relay and the forbidden regions. We present Alibi Routing, a peer-to-peer overlay routing system for finding alibis securely and efficiently. One of the primary distinguishing characteristics of Alibi Routing is that it does not require knowledge of--or modifications to--the Internet's routing hardware or policies. Rather, Alibi Routing is able to derive its proofs of avoidance from user-provided GPS coordinates and speed of light propagation delays. Using a PlanetLab deployment and larger-scale simulations, we evaluate Alibi Routing to demonstrate that many source-destination pairs can avoid countries of their choosing with little latency inflation. We also identify when Alibi Routing does not work: it has difficulty avoiding regions that users are very close to (or, of course, inside of).},

SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.},

 abstract = {To reduce the impact of network congestion on big data jobs, cluster management frameworks use various heuristics to schedule compute tasks and/or network flows. Most of these schedulers consider the job input data fixed and greedily schedule the tasks and flows that are ready to run. However, a large fraction of production jobs are recurring with predictable characteristics, which allows us to plan ahead for them. Coordinating the placement of data and tasks of these jobs allows for significantly improving their network locality and freeing up bandwidth, which can be used by other jobs running on the cluster. With this intuition, we develop Corral, a scheduling framework that uses characteristics of future workloads to determine an offline schedule which (i) jointly places data and compute to achieve better data locality, and (ii) isolates jobs both spatially (by scheduling them in different parts of the cluster) and temporally, improving their performance. We implement Corral on Apache Yarn, and evaluate it on a 210 machine cluster using production workloads. Compared to Yarn's capacity scheduler, Corral reduces the makespan of these workloads up to 33% and the median completion time up to 56%, with 20-90% reduction in data transferred across racks.},

 abstract = {Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) uses auction-based spot pricing to sell spare capacity, allowing users to bid for cloud resources at a highly reduced rate. Amazon sets the spot price dynamically and accepts user bids above this price. Jobs with lower bids (including those already running) are interrupted and must wait for a lower spot price before resuming. Spot pricing thus raises two basic questions: how might the provider set the price, and what prices should users bid? Computing users' bidding strategies is particularly challenging: higher bid prices reduce the probability of, and thus extra time to recover from, interruptions, but may increase users' cost. We address these questions in three steps: (1) modeling the cloud provider's setting of the spot price and matching the model to historically offered prices, (2) deriving optimal bidding strategies for different job requirements and interruption overheads, and (3) adapting these strategies to MapReduce jobs with master and slave nodes having different interruption overheads. We run our strategies on EC2 for a variety of job sizes and instance types, showing that spot pricing reduces user cost by 90% with a modest increase in completion time compared to on-demand pricing.},

 abstract = {Modern datacenter applications demand high throughput (40Gbps) and ultra-low latency (< 10 μs per hop) from the network, with low CPU overhead. Standard TCP/IP stacks cannot meet these requirements, but Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) can. On IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA is deployed using RoCEv2 protocol, which relies on Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) to enable a drop-free network. However, PFC can lead to poor application performance due to problems like head-of-line blocking and unfairness. To alleviates these problems, we introduce DCQCN, an end-to-end congestion control scheme for RoCEv2. To optimize DCQCN performance, we build a fluid model, and provide guidelines for tuning switch buffer thresholds, and other protocol parameters. Using a 3-tier Clos network testbed, we show that DCQCN dramatically improves throughput and fairness of RoCEv2 RDMA traffic. DCQCN is implemented in Mellanox NICs, and is being deployed in Microsoft's datacenters.},

 abstract = {Network middleboxes must offer high availability, with automatic failover when a device fails. Achieving high availability is challenging because failover must correctly restore lost state (e.g., activity logs, port mappings) but must do so quickly (e.g., in less than typical transport timeout values to minimize disruption to applications) and with little overhead to failure-free operation (e.g., additional per-packet latencies of 10-100s of us). No existing middlebox design provides failover that is correct, fast to recover, and imposes little increased latency on failure-free operations. We present a new design for fault-tolerance in middleboxes that achieves these three goals. Our system, FTMB (for Fault-Tolerant MiddleBox), adopts the classical approach of "rollback recovery" in which a system uses information logged during normal operation to correctly reconstruct state after a failure. However, traditional rollback recovery cannot maintain high throughput given the frequent output rate of middleboxes. Hence, we design a novel solution to record middlebox state which relies on two mechanisms: (1) 'ordered logging', which provides lightweight logging of the information needed after recovery, and (2) a `parallel release' algorithm which, when coupled with ordered logging, ensures that recovery is always correct. We implement ordered logging and parallel release in Click and show that for our test applications our design adds only 30$\mu$s of latency to median per packet latencies. Our system introduces moderate throughput overheads (5-30%) and can reconstruct lost state in 40-275ms for practical systems.},

We tackle the open problem of automatic, correct and fast composition of multiple independently specified network policies. We first develop a high-level Policy Graph Abstraction (PGA) that allows network policies to be expressed simply and independently, and leverage the graph structure to detect and resolve policy conflicts efficiently. Besides supporting ACL policies, PGA also models and composes service chaining policies, i.e., the sequence of middleboxes to be traversed, by merging multiple service chain requirements into conflict-free composed chains.

 abstract = {Many network functions executed in modern datacenters, e.g., load balancing, application-level QoS, and congestion control, exhibit three common properties at the data-plane: they need to access and modify state, to perform computations, and to access application semantics -- this is critical since many network functions are best expressed in terms of application-level messages. In this paper, we argue that the end hosts are a natural enforcement point for these functions and we present Eden, an architecture for implementing network functions at datacenter end hosts with minimal network support. Eden comprises three components, a centralized controller, an enclave at each end host, and Eden-compliant applications called stages. To implement network functions, the controller configures stages to classify their data into messages and the enclaves to apply action functions based on a packet's class. Our Eden prototype includes enclaves implemented both in the OS kernel and on programmable NICs. Through case studies, we show how application-level classification and the ability to run actual programs on the data-path allows Eden to efficiently support a broad range of network functions at the network's edge.},

 abstract = {Datacenter networks deal with a variety of workloads, ranging from latency-sensitive small flows to bandwidth-hungry large flows. Load balancing schemes based on flow hashing, e.g., ECMP, cause congestion when hash collisions occur and can perform poorly in asymmetric topologies. Recent proposals to load balance the network require centralized traffic engineering, multipath-aware transport, or expensive specialized hardware. We propose a mechanism that avoids these limitations by (i) pushing load-balancing functionality into the soft network edge (e.g., virtual switches) such that no changes are required in the transport layer, customer VMs, or networking hardware, and (ii) load balancing on fine-grained, near-uniform units of data (flowcells) that fit within end-host segment offload optimizations used to support fast networking speeds. We design and implement such a soft-edge load balancing scheme, called Presto, and evaluate it on a 10 Gbps physical testbed. We demonstrate the computational impact of packet reordering on receivers and propose a mechanism to handle reordering in the TCP receive offload functionality.

@proceedings{Uhlig:2015:2785956,
 abstract = {Welcome to the 2015 ACM SIGCOMM Conference, and welcome to London! This year, a program committee of 49 networking researchers reviewed a total of 242 submissions. Reviewing was double-blind, and review assignment avoided conflicts of interest as defined in the submission instructions posted on the SIGCOMM 2015 web site. The PC's composition represented the breadth of the community: from industry and academia, with expertise across the range of topics within the field of networking. Roughly a third of the PC consisted of members serving for the first time. The PC included members of the EE communications research community whose work overlaps physical-layer topics of interest to SIGCOMM. The PC was augmented by 37 outside domain expert reviewers. The PC and the domain experts together wrote more than 1100 reviews over three rounds of reviewing. The PC met in person on April 23rd and 24th, 2015, in Redmond, Washington, to select the final program. During the one and a half-day PC meeting, the PC discussed 74 papers, each of which had received between 5 and 8 reviews; the result is this outstanding final program of 40 papers. A PC member shepherded every accepted paper to assist the authors in improving their work for the paper's camera-ready version. We share the PC's strong enthusiasm for the work appearing in the program, and hope that you enjoy reading the papers and hearing the presentations at the conference. We are particularly excited to introduce a new track, the Experience Track, to SIGCOMM this year. This track, as the CFP stated, is for "experience papers on the design, analysis, and evaluation of techniques in commercial or otherwise widely used deployment." Our aim in creating this track is for SIGCOMM to help extend the community's knowledge of how known techniques fare in realistic settings, and particularly in settings that most in the community cannot duplicate, for reasons of scale or otherwise. To allow the Best Paper Award to reflect not only the content of the camera-ready papers, but also the reception work receives from the community at the conference-particularly in questions and answers following a presentation-the SIGCOMM 2015 Best Paper Award will be decided at the conference, and will be announced at the start of the conference's third day. Papers with any authors in conflict with either PC chair are excluded from consideration for a Best Paper Award.},

 abstract = {Effectively anonymizing Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls requires a scalable anonymity network that is resilient to traffic analysis and has sufficiently low delay for high-quality voice calls. The popular Tor anonymity network, for instance, is not designed for the former and cannot typically achieve the latter. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of Herd, an anonymity network where a set of dedicated, fully interconnected cloud-based proxies yield suitably low-delay circuits, while untrusted superpeers add scalability. Herd provides caller/callee anonymity among the clients within a trust zone (e.g., jurisdiction) and under a strong adversarial model. Simulations based on a trace of 370 million mobile phone calls among 10.8 million users indicate that Herd achieves anonymity among millions of clients with low bandwidth requirements, and that superpeers decrease the bandwidth and CPU requirements of the trusted infrastructure by an order of magnitude. Finally, experiments using a prototype deployment on Amazon EC2 show that Herd has a delay low enough for high-quality calls in most cases.},

 abstract = {Low latency analytics on geographically distributed datasets (across datacenters, edge clusters) is an upcoming and increasingly important challenge. The dominant approach of aggregating all the data to a single datacenter significantly inflates the timeliness of analytics. At the same time, running queries over geo-distributed inputs using the current intra-DC analytics frameworks also leads to high query response times because these frameworks cannot cope with the relatively low and variable capacity of WAN links. We present Iridium, a system for low latency geo-distributed analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times by optimizing placement of both data and tasks of the queries. The joint data and task placement optimization, however, is intractable. Therefore, Iridium uses an online heuristic to redistribute datasets among the sites prior to queries' arrivals, and places the tasks to reduce network bottlenecks during the query's execution. Finally, it also contains a knob to budget WAN usage. Evaluation across eight worldwide EC2 regions using production queries show that Iridium speeds up queries by 3× -- 19× and lowers WAN usage by 15% -- 64% compared to existing baselines.},

We contribute by a fast and scalable software routing lookup algorithm based on a multiway trie, called Poptrie. Named after our approach to traversing the tree, it leverages the population count instruction on bit-vector indices for the descendant nodes to compress the data structure within the CPU cache. Poptrie outperforms the state-of-the-art technologies, Tree BitMap, DXR and SAIL, in all of the evaluations using random and real destination queries on 35 routing tables, including the real global tier-1 ISP's full-route routing table. Poptrie peaks between 174 and over 240 Million lookups per second (Mlps) with a single core and tables with 500--800k routes, consistently 4--578% faster than all competing algorithms in all the tests we ran. We provide the comprehensive performance evaluation, remarkably with the CPU cycle analysis. This paper shows the suitability of Poptrie in the future Internet including IPv6, where a larger route table is expected with longer prefixes.},

Realizing this vision is challenging though as SDN proposals to date require substantial and expensive changes to the existing network architecture before the benefits can be realized. As a result, the number of SDN deployments has been rather limited in scope. To kickstart a wide-scale SDN deployment, there is a need for low-risk, high return solutions that solve a timely problem. As one possible solution, we show how we can significantly improve the performance of legacy IP routers, i.e. "supercharge" them, by combining them with SDN-enabled devices. In this abstract, we supercharge one particular aspect of the router performance: its convergence time after a link or a node failure.},

Since the World Wide Web has become one of the most popular and important applications on the Internet, how to effectively support the dominant browser and server based web applications is a key to the success of CCN. However, the existing web browsers and servers are mainly designed for the HTTP protocol over TCP/IP networks and cannot directly support CCN-based web applications. Existing research mainly focuses on plug-in or proxy/gateway approaches at client and server sides, and these schemes seriously impact the service performance due to multiple protocol conversions. To address above problems, we designed and implemented a CCN web browser and a CCN web server to natively support CCN protocol. To facilitate the smooth evolution from IP networks to CCN, CCNBrowser and CCNxTomcat also support the HTTP protocol besides the CCN. Experimental results show that CCNBrowser and CCNxTomcat outperform existing implementations. Finally, a real CCN-based web application is deployed on a CCN experimental testbed, which validates the applicability of CCNBrowser and CCNxTomcat.},

Unfortunately, there is also significant overhead involved with DNSSEC: verifying certificate chains of signed DNS messages involves extra computation, queries to remote resolvers, additional transfers, and introduces added latency into the DNS query path. We pose the question: is it possible to achieve practical security without always verifying this certificate chain if we use a different, outside source of trust between resolvers? We believe we can. Namely, by using a long-lived, mutually authenticated TLS connection between pairs of DNS resolvers, we suggest that we can maintain near-equivalent levels of security with very little extra overhead compared to a non-DNSSEC enabled resolver. By using a reputation system or probabilistically verifying a portion of DNSSEC responses would allow for near-equivalent levels of security to be reached, even in the face of compromised resolvers.},

We show via prototypes and experiments that it is possible to achieve communication rates of up to 5 Mbps at a range of 1 m and 1 Mbps at a range of 5 meters. Such performance is an order to three orders of magnitude better than the best known prior WiFi backscatter system [27,25].

@article{Zaki:2015:ACC:2829988.2787498,
 abstract = {Legacy congestion controls including TCP and its variants are known to perform poorly over cellular networks due to highly variable capacities over short time scales, self-inflicted packet delays, and packet losses unrelated to congestion. To cope with these challenges, we present Verus, an end-to-end congestion control protocol that uses delay measurements to react quickly to the capacity changes in cellular networks without explicitly attempting to predict the cellular channel dynamics. The key idea of Verus is to continuously learn a delay profile that captures the relationship between end-to-end packet delay and outstanding window size over short epochs and uses this relationship to increment or decrement the window size based on the observed short-term packet delay variations. While the delay-based control is primarily for congestion avoidance, Verus uses standard TCP features including multiplicative decrease upon packet loss and slow start. Through a combination of simulations, empirical evaluations using cellular network traces, and real-world evaluations against standard TCP flavors and state of the art protocols like Sprout, we show that Verus outperforms these protocols in cellular channels. In comparison to TCP Cubic, Verus achieves an order of magnitude (> 10x) reduction in delay over 3G and LTE networks while achieving comparable throughput (sometimes marginally higher). In comparison to Sprout, Verus achieves up to 30% higher throughput in rapidly changing cellular networks.},

 abstract = {Many geo-distributed systems rely on a replica selection algorithms to communicate with the closest set of replicas. Unfortunately, the bursty nature of the Internet traffic and ever changing network conditions present a problem in identifying the best choices of replicas. Suboptimal replica choices result in increased response latency and reduced system performance. In this work we present GeoPerf, a tool that tries to automate testing of geo-distributed replica selection algorithms. We used GeoPerf to test Cassandra and MongoDB, two popular data stores, and found bugs in each of these systems.},

@inproceedings{Sherry:2015:BDP:2785956.2787502,
 abstract = {Many network middleboxes perform deep packet inspection (DPI), a set of useful tasks which examine packet payloads. These tasks include intrusion detection (IDS), exfiltration detection, and parental filtering. However, a long-standing issue is that once packets are sent over HTTPS, middleboxes can no longer accomplish their tasks because the payloads are encrypted. Hence, one is faced with the choice of only one of two desirable properties: the functionality of middleboxes and the privacy of encryption. We propose BlindBox, the first system that simultaneously provides {\em both} of these properties. The approach of BlindBox is to perform the deep-packet inspection {\em directly on the encrypted traffic. BlindBox realizes this approach through a new protocol and new encryption schemes. We demonstrate that BlindBox enables applications such as IDS, exfiltration detection and parental filtering, and supports real rulesets from both open-source and industrial DPI systems. We implemented BlindBox and showed that it is practical for settings with long-lived HTTPS connections. Moreover, its core encryption scheme is 3-6 orders of magnitude faster than existing relevant cryptographic schemes.},

@inproceedings{Chowdhury:2015:ECS:2785956.2787480,
 abstract = {Inter-coflow scheduling improves application-level communication performance in data-parallel clusters. However, existing efficient schedulers require a priori coflow information and ignore cluster dynamics like pipelining, task failures, and speculative executions, which limit their applicability. Schedulers without prior knowledge compromise on performance to avoid head-of-line blocking. In this paper, we present Aalo that strikes a balance and efficiently schedules coflows without prior knowledge. Aalo employs Discretized Coflow-Aware Least-Attained Service (D-CLAS) to separate coflows into a small number of priority queues based on how much they have already sent across the cluster. By performing prioritization across queues and by scheduling coflows in the FIFO order within each queue, Aalo's non-clairvoyant scheduler reduces coflow completion times while guaranteeing starvation freedom. EC2 deployments and trace-driven simulations show that communication stages complete 1.93X faster on average and 3.59X faster at the 95th percentile using Aalo in comparison to per-flow mechanisms. Aalo's performance is comparable to that of solutions using prior knowledge, and Aalo outperforms them in presence of cluster dynamics.},

 abstract = {The need for fault tolerance and scalability is leading to the development of distributed SDN operating systems and applications. But how can you develop such systems and applications reliably without access to an expensive testbed? We continue to observe SDN development practices using full system virtualization or heavyweight containers, increasing complexity and overhead while decreasing usability. We demonstrate a simpler and more efficient approach: using Mininet's cluster mode to easily deploy a virtual testbed of lightweight containers on a single machine, an ad hoc cluster, or a dedicated hardware testbed. By adding an open source, distributed network operating system such as ONOS, we can create a flexible and scalable open source development platform for distributed SDN system and application software development.},
