One of the issues of RouteFlow is that an administrator needs to devote a lot of time (typically 7 hours for 28 switches) in manual configurations. We propose and demonstrate a framework that can automatically configure RouteFlow. For this demonstration, we use an emulated pan-European topology of 28 switches. In the demonstration, we stream a video clip from a server to a remote client, and show that the video clip reaches at the remote client within 4 minutes (including the configuration time). In addition, we show automatic configuration of RouteFlow using a GUI (Graphical User Interface).},

Our API is implemented by an OpenFlow controller that delegates read and write authority from the network's administrators to end users, or applications and devices acting on their behalf. Users can then work with the network, rather than around it, to achieve better performance, security, or predictable behavior. Our API serves well as the next layer atop current SDN stacks. Our design addresses the two key challenges: how to safely decompose control and visibility of the network, and how to resolve conflicts between untrusted users and across requests, while maintaining baseline levels of fairness and security. Using a real OpenFlow testbed, we demonstrate our API's feasibility through microbenchmarks, and its usefulness by experiments with four real applications modified to take advantage of it.},

 abstract = {Datacenter networks (DCNs) are constantly evolving due to various updates such as switch upgrades and VM migrations. Each update must be carefully planned and executed in order to avoid disrupting many of the mission-critical, interactive applications hosted in DCNs. The key challenge arises from the inherent difficulty in synchronizing the changes to many devices, which may result in unforeseen transient link load spikes or even congestions. We present one primitive, zUpdate, to perform congestion-free network updates under asynchronous switch and traffic matrix changes. We formulate the update problem using a network model and apply our model to a variety of representative update scenarios in DCNs. We develop novel techniques to handle several practical challenges in realizing zUpdate as well as implement the zUpdate prototype on OpenFlow switches and deploy it on a testbed that resembles real DCN topology. Our results, from both real-world experiments and large-scale trace-driven simulations, show that zUpdate can effectively perform congestion-free updates in production DCNs.},

 abstract = {With lower latency and higher bandwidth than its predecessor 3G networks, the latest cellular technology 4G LTE has been attracting many new users. However, the interactions among applications, network transport protocol, and the radio layer still remain unexplored. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study of these interactions and their impact on performance, using a combination of active and passive measurements. We observed that LTE has significantly shorter state promotion delays and lower RTTs than those of 3G networks. We discovered various inefficiencies in TCP over LTE such as undesired slow start. We further developed a novel and lightweight passive bandwidth estimation technique for LTE networks. Using this tool, we discovered that many TCP connections significantly under-utilize the available bandwidth. On average, the actually used bandwidth is less than 50% of the available bandwidth. This causes data downloads to be longer, and incur additional energy overhead. We found that the under-utilization can be caused by both application behavior and TCP parameter setting. We found that 52.6% of all downlink TCP flows have been throttled by limited TCP receive window, and that data transfer patterns for some popular applications are both energy and network unfriendly. All these findings highlight the need to develop transport protocol mechanisms and applications that are more LTE-friendly.},

If as little as one machine in 10,000 is a latency outlier, around 18% of requests will experience high latency. The sacrifice of latency determinism for bandwidth, however, is not an inevitable one. In our R2D2 architecture, we conceptually split the data centre network into an unbuffered, unswitched low-latency network (LLNet) and a deeply buffered bandwidth centric network (BBNet). Through explicitly scheduling network multiplexing in software, our prototype implementation achieves 99.995% and 99.999% messaging latencies of 35us and 75us respectively for 1514-byte packets on a fully loaded network. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to merge the conceptually separate LLNet and BBNet networks onto the same physical infrastructure using commodity switched Ethernet hardware.},

 abstract = {Using a large Web search service as a case study, we highlight the challenges that modern Web services face in understanding and diagnosing the response time experienced by users. We show that search response time (SRT) varies widely over time and also exhibits counter-intuitive behavior. It is actually higher during off-peak hours, when the query load is lower, than during peak hours. To resolve this paradox and explain SRT variations in general, we develop an analysis framework that separates systemic variations due to periodic changes in service usage and anomalous variations due to unanticipated events such as failures and denial-of-service attacks. We find that systemic SRT variations are primarily caused by systemic changes in aggregate network characteristics, nature of user queries, and browser types. For instance, one reason for higher SRTs during off-peak hours is that during those hours a greater fraction of queries come from slower, mainly-residential networks. We also develop a technique that, by factoring out the impact of such variations, robustly detects and diagnoses performance anomalies in SRT. Deployment experience shows that our technique detects three times more true (operator-verified) anomalies than existing techniques.},

 abstract = {Today's data centers must support a range of workloads with different demands. While existing approaches handle routine traffic smoothly, ephemeral but intense hotspots cause excessive packet loss and severely degrade performance. This loss occurs even though the congestion is typically highly localized, with spare buffer capacity available at nearby switches. We argue that switches should share buffer capacity to effectively handle this spot congestion without the latency or monetary hit of deploying large buffers at individual switches. We present detour-induced buffer sharing (DIBS), a mechanism that achieves a near lossless network without requiring additional buffers. Using DIBS, a congested switch detours packets randomly to neighboring switches to avoid dropping the packets. We implement DIBS in hardware, on software routers in a testbed, and in simulation, and we demonstrate that it reduces the 99th percentile of query completion time by 85%, with very little impact on background traffic.},

This poster describes our ongoing work in characterizing and minimizing the communication cost of Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) graph mining systems, like Pregel, when scaling to 4,096 compute nodes. Existing implementations generally assume a fixed communication cost. This is sufficient in small deployments as the BSP programming model (i.e., overlapping computation and communication) masks small variations in the underlying network. In large scale deployments, such variations can dominate the overall runtime characteristics. In this poster, we first quantify the impact of network communication on the total compute time of a Pregel system. We then propose an efficient vertex placement strategy that subsamples highly connected vertices and applies the Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) algorithm to efficiently partition the input graph and place partitions closer to each other based on their expected communication patterns. We finally describe a vertex replication strategy to further reduce communication overhead.},

The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate how data compression can benefit the networking community, by showing how to squeeze the IP Forwarding Information Base (FIB), the giant table consulted by IP routers to make forwarding decisions, into information-theoretical entropy bounds, with essentially zero cost on longest prefix match and FIB update. First, we adopt the state-of-the-art in compressed data structures, yielding a static entropy-compressed FIB representation with asymptotically optimal lookup. Then, we re-design the venerable prefix tree, used commonly for IP lookup for at least 20 years in IP routers, to also admit entropy bounds and support lookup in optimal time and update in nearly optimal time. Evaluations on a Linux kernel prototype indicate that our compressors encode a FIB comprising more than 440K prefixes to just about 100--400 KBytes of memory, with a threefold increase in lookup throughput and no penalty on FIB updates.},

 abstract = {Welcome to the 2012 ACM SIGCOMM Conference in Helsinki, Finland, which is a wonderful location and incidentally is the farthest north that the conference has ventured to in its long history! It is our pleasure to introduce the technical program of the conference. This year's program continues SIGCOMM's tradition of presenting outstanding work that suggests new areas of research in networking. The program committee accepted 31 papers selected from 235 submissions. We felt it was important to have a broad view of networking; this allowed us to choose papers on such diverse topics as on-chip networking, key-value stores, and measuring click spam. While this year's program continues to reflect a recent renaissance in data centers and wireless, traditional topics such as routing, QoS, and measurement are also well represented. The papers came from a rich mix of authors from both academia and industry across the globe. Authors from organizations in around 25 countries submitted papers, and the final program includes authors from over 30 organizations in 8 countries. It was a delight to work with a terrific technical program committee of 49 members from all over the world and including distinguished academic and industrial researchers. We chose the PC with care, trying to balance experience with youth, and recognizing authors who have made consistent technical contributions in SIGCOMM and other top conferences, while ensuring broad technical area coverage and a wide geographic representation. Members of the PC were drawn from 9 countries in 4 continents, with a quarter of the PC comprising first-time members, both relatively young networking researchers and experienced researchers from sister areas such as operating systems and mobile systems. We are grateful for the insight and care that our PC displayed, working hard and responding to our every request. We are also delighted to report that the first-time PC members were a wonderful addition, enriching the PC with their insights and exhibiting a high degree of diligence and professionalism. We continued the tradition of a two-round review process, with a first round of three reviews for each paper. Around half the submitted papers were chosen for the second round, which then generated three more reviews. After the second round and a subsequent online discussion phase, around 60 papers were chosen for discussion at the PC meeting. As chairs we went less by numerical score in order to decide which paper to advance than by the actual reviews, realizing that numerical scores vary widely with reviewers. In a few cases, we sought external reviewers to obtain an expert opinion. The PC meeting was held in San Jose, CA, USA, over a day and a half. While all of the papers in the discussion set were discussed and had tentative decisions made on day 1, the half-day on day 2 allowed plenty of time for the PC to revisit, and in some cases reverse, the decisions made on day 1, and even bring up papers for discussion papers that hadn't been shortlisted for discussion on day 1. Despite following the traditional process, this year's review process was marked by two new mechanisms. First, we reintroduced an author response phase, which had last been tried in SIGCOMM over a decade ago. To make the author response effective, we formulated a careful set of instructions, including illustrative examples, to help make the author responses more factual and effective. The author response phase was intended partly to reduce the possibility of mistaken reviews, but also to promote an approximation to the healthy dialog between authors and reviewers inherent in the classical journal process. We were delighted with the quality of the author responses we saw even with (eventually) rejected papers: respectful, factual, and insightful. The responses were all considered as part of the PC discussion, and some indeed changed the reviewers' minds. Second, the entire PC made an attempt to provide constructive reviews, emphasizing the positive, and suggesting where the paper could be improved. To make explicit the value we placed on good reviews and recognize exceptional contributions in this regard by PC members, we instituted 3 Outstanding Reviewer Awards, which will be presented at the conference. The selection of the award papers started with nominations made by PC members. We as the PC chairs shortlisted 5 of the nominated papers and passed these on to an awards committee chaired by David Wetherall and also comprising T.V. Lakshman, Dave Levin, and Ratul Mahajan, all members of the PC. We are grateful to the members of the awards committee for conducting a thorough process and sending us their selections in quick time. It is a pleasure to present the Best Paper Award for ACM SIGCOMM 2012 to the paper titled "Multi-Resource Fair Queueing for Packet Processing" by Ali Ghodsi, Vyas Sekar, Matei Zaharia, and Ion Stoica, and the Best Student Paper Award to the paper titled "Picasso: Flexible RF and Spectrum Slicing" by Steven Hong, Jeff Mehlman, and Sachin Katti. For the Outstanding Reviewer Awards, we, the PC chairs, made the selections based on the quality and timeliness of reviewing, participation in the online and PC meeting discussions, and the willingness to go the extra mile when needed. It was challenging for us to make a selection from among the many PC members who contributed so strongly, but after careful thought, it is our pleasure to recognize Aditya Akella, Matt Caesar, and Dave Levin with the Outstanding Reviewer Awards for SIGCOMM 2012. Congratulations to all of the award winners, authors as well as reviewers.},

 abstract = {A number of home-installed middleboxes, e.g., BISMark and SamKnows, and web-based tools, e.g., Netalyzr and Ookla's speedtest service, have been developed recently to enable residential broadband users to gauge their network service quality. One challenge to designing these systems is to provide stable network measurement. That is, the measurement results will not be fluctuated by sporadic overheads incurred inside the middlebox or web browser. In this poster, we propose a network measurement ware, OMware, to increase the stability of residential broadband measurement. The key feature is to implement the send and receive functions for measurement packets in the kernel. Our preliminary evaluation for an OpenWrt implementation shows that OMware provides very stable throughput and delay measurement, compared with typical socket-based measurement at the user level.},

@article{Balachandran:2013:DPM:2534169.2486025,
 abstract = {Improving users' quality of experience (QoE) is crucial for sustaining the advertisement and subscription based revenue models that enable the growth of Internet video. Despite the rich literature on video and QoE measurement, our understanding of Internet video QoE is limited because of the shift from traditional methods of measuring video quality (e.g., Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and user experience (e.g., opinion scores). These have been replaced by new quality metrics (e.g., rate of buffering, bitrate) and new engagement centric measures of user experience (e.g., viewing time and number of visits). The goal of this paper is to develop a predictive model of Internet video QoE. To this end, we identify two key requirements for the QoE model: (1) it has to be tied in to observable user engagement and (2) it should be actionable to guide practical system design decisions. Achieving this goal is challenging because the quality metrics are interdependent, they have complex and counter-intuitive relationships to engagement measures, and there are many external factors that confound the relationship between quality and engagement (e.g., type of video, user connectivity). To address these challenges, we present a data-driven approach to model the metric interdependencies and their complex relationships to engagement, and propose a systematic framework to identify and account for the confounding factors. We show that a delivery infrastructure that uses our proposed model to choose CDN and bitrates can achieve more than 20\% improvement in overall user engagement compared to strawman approaches.},

In this paper, we show that Wi-Fi can also extend our senses, enabling us to see moving objects through walls and behind closed doors. In particular, we can use such signals to identify the number of people in a closed room and their relative locations. We can also identify simple gestures made behind a wall, and combine a sequence of gestures to communicate messages to a wireless receiver without carrying any transmitting device. The paper introduces two main innovations. First, it shows how one can use MIMO interference nulling to eliminate reflections off static objects and focus the receiver on a moving target. Second, it shows how one can track a human by treating the motion of a human body as an antenna array and tracking the resulting RF beam. We demonstrate the validity of our design by building it into USRP software radios and testing it in office buildings.},

 abstract = {Networks today rely on middleboxes to provide critical performance, security, and policy compliance capabilities. Achieving these benefits and ensuring that the traffic is directed through the desired sequence of middleboxes requires significant manual effort and operator expertise. In this respect, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers a promising alternative. Middleboxes, however, introduce new aspects (e.g., policy composition, resource management, packet modifications) that fall outside the purvey of traditional L2/L3 functions that SDN supports (e.g., access control or routing).  This paper presents SIMPLE, a SDN-based policy enforcement layer for efficient middlebox-specific "traffic steering''. In designing SIMPLE, we take an explicit stance to work within the constraints of legacy middleboxes and existing SDN interfaces. To this end, we address algorithmic and system design challenges to demonstrate the feasibility of using SDN to simplify middlebox traffic steering. In doing so, we also take a significant step toward addressing industry concerns surrounding the ability of SDN to integrate with existing infrastructure and support L4-L7 capabilities.},

To this end, we develop Dhwani, a novel, acoustics-based NFC system that uses the microphone and speakers on mobile phones, thus eliminating the need for any specialized NFC hardware. A key feature of Dhwani is the JamSecure technique, which uses self-jamming coupled with self-interference cancellation at the receiver, to provide an information-theoretically secure communication channel between the devices.

 abstract = {RFIDs are emerging as a vital component of the Internet of Things. In 2012, billions of RFIDs have been deployed to locate equipment, track drugs, tag retail goods, etc. Current RFID systems, however, can only identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (which could be up to tens of meters), but cannot pinpoint its exact location. Past proposals for addressing this limitation rely on a line-of-sight model and hence perform poorly when faced with multipath effects or non-line-of-sight, which are typical in real-world deployments. This paper introduces the first fine-grained RFID positioning system that is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Unlike past work, which considers multipath as detrimental, our design exploits multipath to accurately locate RFIDs. The intuition underlying our design is that nearby RFIDs experience a similar multipath environment (e.g., reflectors in the environment) and thus exhibit similar multipath profiles. We capture and extract these multipath profiles by using a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) created via antenna motion. We then adapt dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques to pinpoint a tag's location. We built a prototype of our design using USRP software radios. Results from a deployment of 200 commercial RFIDs in our university library demonstrate that the new design can locate misplaced books with a median accuracy of 11~cm.},

 abstract = {We present SWAN, a system that boosts the utilization of inter-datacenter networks by centrally controlling when and how much traffic each service sends and frequently re-configuring the network's data plane to match current traffic demand. But done simplistically, these re-configurations can also cause severe, transient congestion because different switches may apply updates at different times. We develop a novel technique that leverages a small amount of scratch capacity on links to apply updates in a provably congestion-free manner, without making any assumptions about the order and timing of updates at individual switches. Further, to scale to large networks in the face of limited forwarding table capacity, SWAN greedily selects a small set of entries that can best satisfy current demand. It updates this set without disrupting traffic by leveraging a small amount of scratch capacity in forwarding tables. Experiments using a testbed prototype and data-driven simulations of two production networks show that SWAN carries 60% more traffic than the current practice.},

 abstract = {As the rollout of secure route origin authentication with the RPKI slowly gains traction among network operators, there is a push to standardize secure path validation for BGP (i.e., S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). Origin authentication already does much to improve routing security. Moreover, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and slow, with S*BGP coexisting in "partial deployment" alongside BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and experimental approach to study the security benefits provided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey of 100 network operators to find the policies that are likely to be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We find that S*BGP provides only meagre benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are used. We also study the security benefits of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP, and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.},

One aims toward lossless, flat layer-2 fabrics based on Converged Enhanced Ethernet or InfiniBand, with benefits in efficiency and performance. The other targets flexibility based on Software Defined Networking, which enables Overlay Virtual Networking. Although clearly complementary, these trends also exhibit some conflicts: In contrast to physical fabrics, which avoid packet drops by means of flow control, practically all current virtual networks are lossy. We quantify these losses for several common combinations of hypervisors and virtual switches, and show their detrimental effect on application performance. Moreover, we propose a zero-loss Overlay Virtual Network (zOVN) designed to reduce the query and flow completion time of latency-sensitive datacenter applications. We describe its architecture and detail the design of its key component, the zVALE lossless virtual switch. As proof of concept, we implemented a zOVN prototype and benchmark it with Partition-Aggregate in two testbeds, achieving an up to 15-fold reduction of the mean completion time with three widespread TCP versions. For larger-scale validation and deeper introspection into zOVN, we developed an OMNeT++ model for accurate cross-layer simulations of a virtualized datacenter, which confirm the validity of our results.},

 abstract = {Software-Defined Networking offers the appeal of a simple, centralized programming model for managing complex networks. However, challenges in managing low-level details, such as setting up and maintaining correct and efficient forwarding tables on distributed switches, often compromise this conceptual simplicity. In this pa- per, we present Maple, a system that simplifies SDN programming by (1) allowing a programmer to use a standard programming language to design an arbitrary, centralized algorithm, which we call an algorithmic policy, to decide the behaviors of an entire network, and (2) providing an abstraction that the programmer-defined, centralized policy runs, conceptually, "afresh" on every packet entering a network, and hence is oblivious to the challenge of translating a high-level policy into sets of rules on distributed individual switches. To implement algorithmic policies efficiently, Maple includes not only a highly-efficient multicore scheduler that can scale efficiently to controllers with 40+ cores, but more importantly a novel tracing runtime optimizer that can automatically record reusable policy decisions, offload work to switches when possible, and keep switch flow tables up-to-date by dynamically tracing the dependency of policy decisions on packet contents as well as the environment (system state). Evaluations using real HP switches show that Maple optimizer reduces HTTP connection time by a factor of 100 at high load. During simulated benchmarking, Maple scheduler, when not running the optimizer, achieves a throughput of over 20 million new flow requests per second on a single machine, with 95-percentile latency under 10 ms.},

@article{Javed:2013:PIR:2534169.2486036,
 abstract = {Interdomain path changes occur frequently. Because routing protocols expose insufficient information to reason about all changes, the general problem of identifying the root cause remains unsolved. In this work, we design and evaluate PoiRoot, a real-time system that allows a provider to accurately isolate the root cause (the network responsible) of path changes affecting its prefixes. First, we develop a new model describing path changes and use it to provably identify the set of all potentially responsible networks. Next, we develop a recursive algorithm that accurately isolates the root cause of any path change. We observe that the algorithm requires monitoring paths that are generally not visible using standard measurement tools. To address this limitation, we combine existing measurement tools in new ways to acquire path information required for isolating the root cause of a path change. We evaluate PoiRoot on path changes obtained through controlled Internet experiments, simulations, and "in-the-wild" measurements. We demonstrate that PoiRoot is highly accurate, works well even with partial information, and generally narrows down the root cause to a single network or two neighboring ones. On controlled experiments PoiRoot is 100% accurate, as opposed to prior work which is accurate only 61.7% of the time.},

 abstract = {In Software Defined Networking (SDN) the control plane is physically separate from the forwarding plane. Control software programs the forwarding plane (e.g., switches and routers) using an open interface, such as OpenFlow. This paper aims to overcomes two limitations in current switching chips and the OpenFlow protocol: i) current hardware switches are quite rigid, allowing ``Match-Action'' processing on only a fixed set of fields, and ii) the OpenFlow specification only defines a limited repertoire of packet processing actions. We propose the RMT (reconfigurable match tables) model, a new RISC-inspired pipelined architecture for switching chips, and we identify the essential minimal set of action primitives to specify how headers are processed in hardware. RMT allows the forwarding plane to be changed in the field without modifying hardware. As in OpenFlow, the programmer can specify multiple match tables of arbitrary width and depth, subject only to an overall resource limit, with each table configurable for matching on arbitrary fields. However, RMT allows the programmer to modify all header fields much more comprehensively than in OpenFlow. Our paper describes the design of a 64 port by 10 Gb/s switch chip implementing the RMT model. Our concrete design demonstrates, contrary to concerns within the community, that flexible OpenFlow hardware switch implementations are feasible at almost no additional cost or power.},

@article{Liu:2013:ABW:2534169.2486015,
 abstract = {We present the design of a communication system that enables two devices to communicate using ambient RF as the only source of power. Our approach leverages existing TV and cellular transmissions to eliminate the need for wires and batteries, thus enabling ubiquitous communication where devices can communicate among themselves at unprecedented scales and in locations that were previously inaccessible. To achieve this, we introduce ambient backscatter, a new communication primitive where devices communicate by backscattering ambient RF signals. Our design avoids the expensive process of generating radio waves; backscatter communication is orders of magnitude more power-efficient than traditional radio communication. Further, since it leverages the ambient RF signals that are already around us, it does not require a dedicated power infrastructure as in traditional backscatter communication. To show the feasibility of our design, we prototype ambient backscatter devices in hardware and achieve information rates of 1 kbps over distances of 2.5 feet and 1.5 feet, while operating outdoors and indoors respectively. We use our hardware prototype to implement proof-of-concepts for two previously infeasible ubiquitous communication applications.},

 abstract = {In OpenFlow, multiple switches share the same control plane which is centralized at what is called the OpenFlow controller. A switch only consists of a forwarding plane. Rules for forwarding individual packets (called flow entries in OpenFlow) are pushed from the controller to the switches. In a network with a high arrival rate of new flows, such as in a data center, the control traffic between the switch and controller can become very high. As a consequence, routing of new flows will be slow. One way to reduce control traffic is to use wildcarded flow entries. Wildcard flow entries can be used to create default routes in the network. However, since switches do not keep track of flows covered by a wildcard flow entry, the controller no longer has knowledge about individual flows. To find out about these individual flows we propose an extension to the current OpenFlow standard to enable packet sampling of wildcard flow entries.},

@article{Kumar:2013:BCM:2534169.2486034,
 abstract = {Recent years have seen major innovations in cross-layer wireless designs. Despite demonstrating significant throughput gains, hardly any of these technologies have made it into real networks. Deploying cross-layer innovations requires adoption from Wi-Fi chip manufacturers. Yet, manufacturers hesitate to undertake major investments without a better understanding of how these designs interact with real networks and applications. This paper presents the first step towards breaking this stalemate, by enabling the adoption of cross-layer designs in today's networks with commodity Wi-Fi cards and actual applications. We present OpenRF, a cross-layer architecture for managing MIMO signal processing. OpenRF enables access points on the same channel to cancel their interference at each other's clients, while beamforming their signal to their own clients. OpenRF is self-configuring, so that network administrators need not understand MIMO or physical layer techniques. We patch the iwlwifi driver to support OpenRF on off-the-shelf Intel cards. We deploy OpenRF on a 20-node network, showing how it manages the complex interaction of cross-layer design with a real network stack, TCP, bursty traffic, and real applications. Our results demonstrate an average gain of 1.6x for TCP traffic and a significant reduction in response time for real-time applications, like remote desktop.},

In the current Internet, the default assumption is that all behavior can be correlated using a variety of identifying information, not the least of which is a user's IP address. Tools like Tor, Privoxy, and even NATs, are located at the opposite end of the spectrum and prevent any behavior from being linked. Instead, our goal is to provide users with more control over linkability---which activites of the user can be correlated at the remote services---not necessarily more anonymity.  We design a cross-layer architecture that provides users with a pseudonym abstraction. To the user, a pseudonym represents a set of activities that the user is fine with linking, and to the outside world, a pseudonym gives the illusion of a single machine. We provide this abstraction by associating each pseudonym with a unique, random address drawn from the IPv6 address space, which is large enough to provide each device with multiple globally-routable addresses. We have implemented and evaluated a prototype that is able to provide unlinkable pseudonyms within the Chrome web browser in order to demonstrate the feasibility, efficacy, and expressiveness of our approach.},

 abstract = {Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has seen a significant resurgence in recent years. ICN promises benefits to users and service providers along several dimensions (e.g., performance, security, and mobility). These benefits, however, come at a non-trivial cost as many ICN proposals envision adding significant complexity to the network by having routers serve as content caches and support nearest-replica routing. This paper is driven by the simple question of whether this additional complexity is justified and if we can achieve these benefits in an incrementally deployable fashion. To this end, we use trace-driven simulations to analyze the quantitative benefits attributed to ICN (e.g., lower latency and congestion). Somewhat surprisingly, we find that pervasive caching and nearest-replica routing are not fundamentally necessary---most of the performance benefits can be achieved with simpler caching architectures. We also discuss how the qualitative benefits of ICN (e.g., security, mobility) can be achieved without any changes to the network. Building on these insights, we present a proof-of-concept design of an incrementally deployable ICN architecture.},

In this study, we investigate the characteristics of RSS (e.g., how the RSS values change as time goes on and between consecutive positions?). On this basis, we design LuPI (Locating using Prior Information) that exploits the characteristics of RSS: with user motion, LuPI uses novel sensors integrated in smartphones to construct the RSS variation space (like radio map) of a floor plan as prior information. The deployment of LuPI is easy and rapid since little human intervention is needed. In LuPI, the calibration of ``radio map'' is crowd-sourced, automatic and scheduled. Experimental results show that LuPI achieves comparable location accuracy to previous approaches, even without the statistical information of site survey.},

 abstract = {While cloud computing providers offer guaranteed allocations for resources such as CPU and memory, they do not offer any guarantees for network resources. The lack of network guarantees prevents tenants from predicting lower bounds on the performance of their applications. The research community has recognized this limitation but, unfortunately, prior solutions have significant limitations: either they are inefficient, because they are not work-conserving, or they are impractical, because they require expensive switch support or congestion-free network cores. In this paper, we propose ElasticSwitch, an efficient and practical approach for providing bandwidth guarantees. ElasticSwitch is efficient because it utilizes the spare bandwidth from unreserved capacity or underutilized reservations. ElasticSwitch is practical because it can be fully implemented in hypervisors, without requiring a specific topology or any support from switches. Because hypervisors operate mostly independently, there is no need for complex coordination between them or with a central controller. Our experiments, with a prototype implementation on a 100-server testbed, demonstrate that ElasticSwitch provides bandwidth guarantees and is work-conserving, even in challenging situations.},

A particular challenge is to design a system that scales well while limiting how much the malicious users can distort the result. This paper presents SplitX, a high-performance analytics system for making differentially private queries over distributed user data. SplitX is typically two to three orders of magnitude more efficient in bandwidth, and from three to five orders of magnitude more efficient in computation than previous comparable systems, while operating under a similar trust model. SplitX accomplishes this performance by replacing public-key operations with exclusive-or operations.

 abstract = {We found that interactive services at Bing have highly variable datacenter-side processing latencies because their processing consists of many sequential stages, parallelization across 10s-1000s of servers and aggregation of responses across the network. To improve the tail latency of such services, we use a few building blocks: reissuing laggards elsewhere in the cluster, new policies to return incomplete results and speeding up laggards by giving them more resources. Combining these building blocks to reduce the overall latency is non-trivial because for the same amount of resource (e.g., number of reissues), different stages improve their latency by different amounts. We present Kwiken, a framework that takes an end-to-end view of latency improvements and costs. It decomposes the problem of minimizing latency over a general processing DAG into a manageable optimization over individual stages. Through simulations with production traces, we show sizable gains; the 99th percentile of latency improves by over 50% when just 0.1% of the responses are allowed to have partial results and by over 40% for 25% of the services when just 5% extra resources are used for reissues.},

In this paper, we present measurement results from a unique dataset containing more than 26 billion DNS query-response pairs collected from more than 600 globally distributed recursive DNS resolvers. We use this dataset to reaffirm findings in published work and notice some significant differences that could be attributed both to the evolving nature of DNS traffic and to our differing perspective. For example, we find that although characteristics of DNS traffic vary greatly across networks, the resolvers within an organization tend to exhibit similar behavior. We further find that more than 50% of DNS queries issued to root servers do not return successful answers, and that the primary cause of lookup failures at root servers is malformed queries with invalid TLDs. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach that detects malicious domain groups using temporal correlation in DNS queries. Our approach requires no comprehensive labeled training set, which can be difficult to build in practice. Instead, it uses a known malicious domain as anchor, and identifies the set of previously unknown malicious domains that are related to the anchor domain. Experimental results illustrate the viability of this approach, i.e. , we attain a true positive rate of more than 96%, and each malicious anchor domain results in a malware domain group with more than 53 previously unknown malicious domains on average.},

 abstract = {Existing IP anonymity systems tend to sacrifice one of low latency, high bandwidth, or resistance to traffic-analysis. High-latency mix-nets like Mixminion batch messages to resist traffic-analysis at the expense of low latency. Onion routing schemes like Tor deliver low latency and high bandwidth, but are not designed to withstand traffic analysis. Designs based on DC-nets or broadcast channels resist traffic analysis and provide low latency, but are limited to low bandwidth communication.  In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Aqua, a high-bandwidth anonymity system that resists traffic analysis. We focus on providing strong anonymity for BitTorrent, and evaluate the performance of Aqua using traces from hundreds of thousands of actual BitTorrent users. We show that Aqua achieves latency low enough for efficient bulk TCP flows, bandwidth sufficient to carry BitTorrent traffic with reasonable efficiency, and resistance to traffic analysis within anonymity sets of hundreds of clients. We conclude that Aqua represents an interesting new point in the space of anonymity network designs.},

 abstract = {Making data the first class entity, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) replaces conventional host-to-host model with content sharing model. However, the huge amount of content and the volatility of replicas cached across the Internet pose significant challenges for addressing content only by name. In this paper, we propose a topology-aware name-based routing protocol which combines the benefits of location-oriented routing and content-centric routing together. We adopt a URL-like naming scheme, which defines register locations and content identifier. Node with copies sends Register messages towards a register using location-oriented routing protocols. All en-path routers record forwarding entries in forwarding table (FIB) as the "bread crumb" to this content. Following the bread crumb, routers know the "best" topology path to the available copies. An Interest is either forwarded towards a "known" copy by the content identifier, or towards the register nodes where it would find the bread crumb to the "best" copies. Compared with the existing flooding or name resolution methods, Our design shows a good potential in terms of scalability, availability and overhead.},

 abstract = {Multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is the latest communication technology that promises to linearly increase the wireless capacity by deploying more antennas on access points (APs). However, the large number of MIMO antennas will generate a huge amount of digital signal samples in real time. This imposes a grand challenge on the AP design by multiplying the computation and the I/O requirements to process the digital samples. This paper presents BigStation, a scalable architecture that enables realtime signal processing in large-scale MIMO systems which may have tens or hundreds of antennas. Our strategy to scale is to extensively parallelize the MU-MIMO processing on many simple and low-cost commodity computing devices. Our design can incrementally support more antennas by proportionally adding more computing devices. To reduce the overall processing latency, which is a critical constraint for wireless communication, we parallelize the MU-MIMO processing with a distributed pipeline based on its computation and communication patterns. At each stage of the pipeline, we further use data partitioning and computation partitioning to increase the processing speed. As a proof of concept, we have built a BigStation prototype based on commodity PC servers and standard Ethernet switches. Our prototype employs 15 PC servers and can support real-time processing of 12 software radio antennas. Our results show that the BigStation architecture is able to scale to tens to hundreds of antennas. With 12 antennas, our BigStation prototype can increase wireless capacity by 6.8x with a low mean processing delay of 860μs. While this latency is not yet low enough for the 802.11 MAC, it already satisfies the real-time requirements of many existing wireless standards, e.g., LTE and WCDMA.},

 abstract = {Natural and human factors cause Internet outages---from big events like Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the Egyptian Internet shutdown in Jan. 2011 to small outages every day that go unpublicized. We describe Trinocular, an outage detection system that uses active probing to understand reliability of edge networks. Trinocular is principled: deriving a simple model of the Internet that captures the information pertinent to outages, and populating that model through long-term data, and learning current network state through ICMP probes. It is parsimonious, using Bayesian inference to determine how many probes are needed. On average, each Trinocular instance sends fewer than 20 probes per hour to each /24 network block under study, increasing Internet "background radiation" by less than 0.7%. Trinocular is also predictable and precise: we provide known precision in outage timing and duration. Probing in rounds of 11 minutes, we detect 100% of outages one round or longer, and estimate outage duration within one-half round. Since we require little traffic, a single machine can track 3.4M /24 IPv4 blocks, all of the Internet currently suitable for analysis. We show that our approach is significantly more accurate than the best current methods, with about one-third fewer false conclusions, and about 30% greater coverage at constant accuracy. We validate our approach using controlled experiments, use Trinocular to analyze two days of Internet outages observed from three sites, and re-analyze three years of existing data to develop trends for the Internet.},

 abstract = {Modern internet applications have resulted in users sharing data with each other in an interactive fashion. These applications have very stringent service level agreements (SLAs) which place tight constraints on the performance of the underlying geo-distributed datastores. Deploying these systems in the cloud to meet such constraints is a challenging task, as application architects have to strike an optimal balance among different contrasting objectives such as maintaining consistency between multiple replicas, minimizing access latency and ensuring high availability. Achieving these objectives requires carefully configuring a number of low-level parameters of the datastores, such as the number of replicas, which DCs contain which data, and the underlying consistency protocol parameters. In this work, we adopt a systematic approach where we develop analytical models that capture the performance of a datastore based on application workload and build a system that can automatically configure the datastore for optimal performance.},

 abstract = {To serve users quickly, Web service providers build infrastructure closer to clients and use multi-stage transport connections. Although these changes reduce client-perceived round-trip times, TCP's current mechanisms fundamentally limit latency improvements. We performed a measurement study of a large Web service provider and found that, while connections with no loss complete close to the ideal latency of one round-trip time, TCP's timeout-driven recovery causes transfers with loss to take five times longer on average. In this paper, we present the design of novel loss recovery mechanisms for TCP that judiciously use redundant transmissions to minimize timeout-driven recovery. Proactive, Reactive, and Corrective are three qualitatively-different, easily-deployable mechanisms that (1) proactively recover from losses, (2) recover from them as quickly as possible, and (3) reconstruct packets to mask loss. Crucially, the mechanisms are compatible both with middleboxes and with TCP's existing congestion control and loss recovery. Our large-scale experiments on Google's production network that serves billions of flows demonstrate a 23% decrease in the mean and 47% in 99th percentile latency over today's TCP.},

While some previous studies have theoretically analyzed the performance of analog channel feedback, this work aims at addressing issues of realizing it in practice and empirically demonstrating its effectiveness.

 abstract = {This paper describes a new approach to end-to-end congestion control on a multi-user network. Rather than manually formulate each endpoint's reaction to congestion signals, as in traditional protocols, we developed a program called Remy that generates congestion-control algorithms to run at the endpoints. In this approach, the protocol designer specifies their prior knowledge or assumptions about the network and an objective that the algorithm will try to achieve, e.g., high throughput and low queueing delay. Remy then produces a distributed algorithm---the control rules for the independent endpoints---that tries to achieve this objective. In simulations with ns-2, Remy-generated algorithms outperformed human-designed end-to-end techniques, including TCP Cubic, Compound, and Vegas. In many cases, Remy's algorithms also outperformed methods that require intrusive in-network changes, including XCP and Cubic-over-sfqCoDel (stochastic fair queueing with CoDel for active queue management).  Remy can generate algorithms both for networks where some parameters are known tightly a priori, e.g. datacenters, and for networks where prior knowledge is less precise, such as cellular networks. We characterize the sensitivity of the resulting performance to the specificity of the prior knowledge, and the consequences when real-world conditions contradict the assumptions supplied at design-time.},

As a result, TCP has evolved over time with new congestion control algorithms such as support for generalized AIMD, background flows, and multipath. On the other hand, explicit congestion control algorithms have been shown to be more efficient. However, they are inherently more rigid because they rely on in-network components. Therefore, it is not clear whether they can be made flexible enough to support diverse application requirements. This paper presents a flexible framework for network resource allocation, called FCP, that accommodates diversity by exposing a simple abstraction for resource allocation. FCP incorporates novel primitives for end-point flexibility (aggregation and preloading) into a single framework and makes economics-based congestion control practical by explicitly handling load variations and by decoupling it from actual billing. We show that FCP allows evolution by accommodating diversity and ensuring coexistence, while being as efficient as existing explicit congestion control algorithms.},

Moreover, pFabric delivers this performance with a very simple design that is based on a key conceptual insight: datacenter transport should decouple flow scheduling from rate control. For flow scheduling, packets carry a single priority number set independently by each flow; switches have very small buffers and implement a very simple priority-based scheduling/dropping mechanism. Rate control is also correspondingly simpler; flows start at line rate and throttle back only under high and persistent packet loss. We provide theoretical intuition and show via extensive simulations that the combination of these two simple mechanisms is sufficient to provide near-optimal performance.},

As faster switch technologies become available, designing a control plane capable of supporting them becomes a key challenge. In this paper, we design and implement an OCS prototype capable of switching in 11.5 us, and we use this prototype to expose a set of challenges that arise when supporting switching at microsecond time scales.

 abstract = {Many applications do not constrain the destinations of their network transfers. New opportunities emerge when such transfers contribute a large amount of network bytes. By choosing the endpoints to avoid congested links, completion times of these transfers as well as that of others without similar flexibility can be improved. In this paper, we focus on leveraging the flexibility in replica placement during writes to cluster file systems (CFSes), which account for almost half of all cross-rack traffic in data-intensive clusters. The replicas of a CFS write can be placed in any subset of machines as long as they are in multiple fault domains and ensure a balanced use of storage throughout the cluster. We study CFS interactions with the cluster network, analyze optimizations for replica placement, and propose Sinbad -- a system that identifies imbalance and adapts replica destinations to navigate around congested links. Experiments on EC2 and trace-driven simulations show that block writes complete 1.3X (respectively, 1.58X) faster as the network becomes more balanced. As a collateral benefit, end-to-end completion times of data-intensive jobs improve as well. Sinbad does so with little impact on the long-term storage balance.},

Ananta combines existing techniques in routing and distributed systems in a unique way and splits the components of a load balancer into a consensus-based reliable control plane and a decentralized scale-out data plane. A key component of Ananta is an agent in every host that can take over the packet modification function from the load balancer, thereby enabling the load balancer to naturally scale with the size of the data center. Due to its distributed architecture, Ananta provides direct server return (DSR) and network address translation (NAT) capabilities across layer-2 boundaries. Multiple instances of Ananta have been deployed in the Windows Azure public cloud with combined bandwidth capacity exceeding 1Tbps. It is serving traffic needs of a diverse set of tenants, including the blob, table and relational storage services. With its scale-out data plane we can easily achieve more than 100Gbps throughput for a single public IP address. In this paper, we describe the requirements of a cloud-scale load balancer, the design of Ananta and lessons learnt from its implementation and operation in the Windows Azure public cloud.},

 abstract = {In existing multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) MAC protocols, a multi-antenna node sends as many concurrent streams as possible once it wins the contention. Though such a scheme allows nodes to utilize the multiplex gain of a MIMO system, it however fails to leverage receive diversity gains provided by multiple receive antennas across nodes. We introduce Multiplex-Diversity Medium Access (MDMA), a MU-MIMO MAC protocol that achieves both the multiplex gain and the receive diversity gain at the same time. Instead of letting a node pair use all the available degrees of freedom, MDMA allows as many contending node pairs to communicate concurrently as possible and share all the degrees of freedom. It hence can exploit the antennas equipped on different receivers to further provide some of concurrent streams more receive diversity, without losing the achievable multiplex gain. We implement a prototype on software radios to demonstrate the throughput gain of MDMA.},

@article{Xia:2013:MQP:2534169.2486008,
 abstract = {With the proliferation of online social networking (OSN) and mobile devices, preserving user privacy has become a great challenge. While prior studies have directly focused on OSN services, we call attention to the privacy leakage in mobile network data. This concern is motivated by two factors. First, the prevalence of OSN usage leaves identifiable digital footprints that can be traced back to users in the real-world. Second, the association between users and their mobile devices makes it easier to associate traffic to its owners. These pose a serious threat to user privacy as they enable an adversary to attribute significant portions of data traffic including the ones with NO identity leaks to network users' true identities. To demonstrate its feasibility, we develop the Tessellation methodology. By applying Tessellation on traffic from a cellular service provider (CSP), we show that up to 50% of the traffic can be attributed to the names of users. In addition to revealing the user identity, the reconstructed profile, dubbed as "mosaic," associates personal information such as political views, browsing habits, and favorite apps to the users. We conclude by discussing approaches for preventing and mitigating the alarming leakage of sensitive user information.},

 abstract = {The growing prevalence of broadband Internet access around the world has made understanding the performance and reliability of broadband access networks extremely important. To better understand the performance anomalies that arise in broadband access networks, we have deployed hundreds of routers in home broadband access networks around the world and are studying the performance of these networks. One of the performance pathologies that we have observed is correlated, sudden latency increases simultaneously and to multiple destinations. In this work, we provide an preliminary glimpse into these sudden latency increases and attempt to understand their causes. Although we do not isolate root cause in this study, observing the sets of destinations that experience correlated latency increases can provide important clues as to the locations in the network that may be inducing these pathologies. We present an algorithm to better identify the network locations that are likely responsible for these pathologies. We then analyze latency data from one month across our home router deployment to determine where in the network latency issues are arising, and how those pathologies differ across regions, ISPs, and countries. Our preliminary analysis suggests that most latency pathologies are to a single destination and a relatively small percentage of these pathologies are likely in the last mile, suggesting that peering within the network may be a more likely culprit for these pathologies than access link problems.},
