 abstract = {Nowadays, distracted driving is becoming a very dangerous epidemic on the roadways. A lot of activities may lead to distracted driving, such as texting, making phone calls, using GPS or road maps, eating, using in-car entertainment systems, etc. As the number of smartphones is rapidly growing year by year, using smartphone is by far the most dangerous and alarming driver distraction. In this paper, we design an app on iPhone for reducing the smartphone-related distracted driving, which can run in the background and can lock the smartphone screen with no passwords required when it detects that the user is driving. After the user finishes driving, the lock will be removed immediately. We also describe a DTM algorithm to detect the transportation mode and give the performance analysis of our system. The results show that our system can save more energy than other related applications.},

Our system iGaze is a visual attention driven networking suite: an iGaze glass (hardware) and a networking protocol VAN (software). Our glass is a low-cost head-mounted glass with a camera, orientation sensors, microphone and speakers, which are embedded with our software for visual attention capture and networking. A visual attention driven networking protocol (VAN) is carefully designed and implemented. In VAN, we design an energy efficient and highly accurate visual attention determination scheme using single camera to capture user's communication interest and a double-matching scheme based on visual direction detection and Doppler effect of acoustic signal to lock the target devices. iGaze has separated and modularized hardware and software design. It can run on top of existing networking protocols, e.g., Wi-Fi.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have shown that web browsing is one of the most prominent cellular applications. It is therefore important for cellular network operators to understand how radio network characteristics (such as signal strength, handovers, load, etc.) influence users' web browsing Quality-of-Experience (web QoE). Understanding the relationship between web QoE and network characteristics is a pre-requisite for cellular network operators to detect when and where degraded network conditions actually impact web QoE. Unfortunately, cellular network operators do not have access to detailed server-side or client-side logs to directly measure web QoE metrics, such as abandonment rate and session length. In this paper, we first devise a machine-learning-based mechanism to infer web QoE metrics from network traces accurately. We then present a large-scale study characterizing the impact of network characteristics on web QoE using a month-long anonymized dataset collected from a major cellular network provider. Our results show that improving signal-to-noise ratio, decreasing load and reducing handovers can improve user experience. We find that web QoE is very sensitive to inter-radio-access-technology (IRAT) handovers. We further find that higher radio data link rate does not necessarily lead to better web QoE. Since many network characteristics are interrelated, we also use machine learning to accurately model the influence of radio network characteristics on user experience metrics. This model can be used by cellular network operators to prioritize the improvement of network factors that most influence web QoE.},

 abstract = {Welcome to ACM MobiCom 2015, the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking. MobiCom is the premier forum for publishing and presenting cutting-edge research in mobile systems and wireless networks. The technical program this year features 38 outstanding papers that cover a wide variety of topics including energy, sensing, security, wireless access, applications, localization, Internet of things, mobile cloud, measurement and analysis. We created a new Experience track this year to encourage authors to present extensive experiences with implementation, deployment, and operations of mobile ncomputing and wireless networks. One of the accepted papers is an Experience paper on cellular networks. This year's call for papers attracted 207 qualified submissions from across the globe that were carefully reviewed by 46 Technical Program Committee (TPC) members (+2 TPC chairs) along with a selected group of external experts. The TPC was formed with the goal of covering diverse research expertise as well as diverse perspectives and approaches. The TPC included researchers from 12 countries including China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA. 25% of the members were female, the highest ever in the history of MobiCom. We also had broad industry participation with TPC members from Alcatel-Lucent, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, and Telefonica. The paper review process was double-blinded and carried out in three phases. In the first phase, each paper was reviewed by at least three TPC members, and the top 112 papers were selected for the second phase. In addition to reviewer scores, reviewer confidence and normalization with respect to other papers in a reviewer's pile, were also considered in selecting papers. In the second phase, each paper was reviewed by at least two more reviewers followed by an online, often intense, discussion, producing 68 papers for the final phase. The final TPC meeting was held on May 28th and 29th in Salt Lake City, Utah. These 68 papers were organized by their topic areas, and discussed at length at the meeting. Eventually, 38 papers were shortlisted for inclusion in the program and a shepherd from the TPC was assigned to each of these papers. As the last step, each of the shortlisted papers was shepherded through a "blind" process where the authors interacted with all the reviewers and the shepherd to address the review comments without knowing the reviewers' or the shepherds' identities. The end result is an exciting technical program composed of 38 very high quality papers. During the review process, Prof. Robin Kravets, the TPC co-chair of MobiCom 2013, handled the papers that were co-authored by TPC chairs, and those that had conflict-of-interest with both TPC chairs. To ensure fairness and preserve the anonymity of all authors and reviewers, the assignment of reviewers, the reviews and discussions of these papers were done out of band without any exposure to the TPC chairs.},

 abstract = {With the rapid proliferation of camera-equipped smart devices (e.g., smartphones, pads, tablets), visible light communication (VLC) over screen-camera links emerges as a novel form of near-field communication. Such communication via smart devices is highly competitive for its user-friendliness, security, and infrastructure-less (i.e., no dependency on WiFi or cellular infrastructure). However, existing approaches mostly focus on improving the transmission speed and ignore the transmission reliability. Considering the interplay between the transmission speed and reliability towards effective end-to-end communication, in this paper, we aim to boost the throughput over screen-camera links by enhancing the transmission reliability. To this end, we propose RDCode, a robust dynamic barcode which enables a novel packet-frame-block structure. Based on the layered structure, we design different error correction schemes at three levels: intra-blocks, inter-blocks and inter-frames, in order to verify and recover the lost blocks and frames. Finally, we implement RDCode and experimentally show that RDCode reaches a high level of transmission reliability (e.g., reducing the error rate to 10%) and yields a at least doubled transmission rate, compared with the existing state-of-the-art approach COBRA.},

 abstract = {Recent years have seen the advent of new RF-localization systems that demonstrate tens of centimeters of accuracy. However, such systems require either deployment of new infrastructure, or extensive fingerprinting of the environment through training or crowdsourcing, impeding their wide-scale adoption. We present Ubicarse, an accurate indoor localization system for commodity mobile devices, with no specialized infrastructure or fingerprinting. Ubicarse enables handheld devices to emulate large antenna arrays using a new formulation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Past work on SAR requires measuring mechanically controlled device movement with millimeter precision, far beyond what commercial accelerometers can provide. In contrast, Ubicarse's core contribution is the ability to perform SAR on handheld devices twisted by their users along unknown paths. Ubicarse is not limited to localizing RF devices; it combines RF localization with stereo-vision algorithms to localize common objects with no RF source attached to them. We implement Ubicarse on a HP SplitX2 tablet and empirically demonstrate a median error of 39 cm in 3-D device localization and 17 cm in object geotagging in complex indoor settings.},

 abstract = {In this demo, we showcase the first software defined radio (SDR) implementation that runs on today's smartphones. Using the SDR, the smartphones are shown to talk to real IEEE 802.15.4 devices such as sensor motes or Phillips Hue (TM) lightbulbs that otherwise they cannot natively communicate with. Furthermore, we make the SDR available as downloadable software ("app") on Google app store, so that anyone may freely download, use, and purge on his or her smartphone, independently of OS upgrades. Detaching SDR from OS allows almost immediate deployment of wireless rotocols, and only on the phones that do need them. By enabling smartphones to speak non-native protocols in this manner, smartphone vendors will be able to support a wide range of wireless protocols without investing separate hardware and real estate in their devices. A promising application area for this concept could be Internet of Things (IoT), where protocols are diverse, typically low-speed, and not well supported by today's smartphones. Therefore, we believe that the smartphones with SDR will become a strong enabler or facilitator of many interesting applications in the IoT environment. We also believe that the concept of wireless protocol as a smartphone app will accelerate wireless protocol design-test-deployment cycle, catalyzing wireless protocol evolutions on smartphones.},

 abstract = {Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has long been used as a technique to save power in a variety of computing domains but typically not in communications devices. A fundamental limit that prevents decreasing the clock frequency is the Nyquist(-Shannon) sampling theorem, which states that the sampling rate must be twice the signal bandwidth. Recently, researchers have leveraged compressive sensing to demonstrate the possibility of decoding a sparse signal below Nyquist rate. In this work, we dramatically extend the state of the art by showing how to decode non-sparse signals, in particular, OFDM systems at sub-Nyquist rates. We exploit the aliasing that results from under-sampling and observe that there exists well-defined structure in terms of how OFDM signals are "folded up" under aliasing. Based on our observations, we present Enfold, which allows existing WiFi chipsets to decode standards-compliant WiFi frames while operating at 50% and 25% of their rated clock rate. Our design is able to attain greater than 96% and 83% raw packet reception rates for moderate SNR while reducing the clock rate by 2x and 4x, respectively. Moreover, our approach can be easily applied to other communication systems based on OFDM modulation. When evaluated on popular smartphone app traces, Enfold reduces energy consumption by up to 34%.},

 abstract = {Expanding our knowledge about human mobility is essential for building efficient wireless protocols and mobile applications. Previous human mobility studies have typically been built upon empirical single-source data (e.g., cellphone or transit data), which inevitably introduces a bias against residents not contributing this type of data, e.g., call detail records cannot be obtained from the residents without cellphone activities, and transit data cannot cover the residents who walk or ride private vehicles. To address this issue, we propose and implement a novel architecture mPat to explore human mobility using multi-source data. A reference implementation of mPat was developed at an unprecedented scale upon the urban infrastructures of Shenzhen, China. The novelty and uniqueness of mPat lie in its three layers: (i) a data feed layer consisting of real-time data feeds from 24 thousand vehicles, 16 million smart cards and 10 million cellphones; (ii) a mobility abstraction layer exploring the correlation and divergence among the multi-source data to analyze and infer human mobility; and (iii) an application layer to improve urban efficiency based on the human mobility findings of the study. The evaluation shows that mPat achieves a 75% inference accuracy, and that its real-world application reduces passenger travel time by 36%.},

Although existing approaches of prefetching and caching are widely used to reduce the browsing latency, they may fail to work effectively because most Web page visits are singletons and the cache hit ratio is unsatisfying. In this work, we design and implement a framework to reduce Web browsing latency for mobile users with a smart prefetching strategy and caching mechanism. The prefetching strategy leverages the skSLRU model, which predicts and prefetches Web pages based on their contents with consideration of user contexts and the devices' status such as power consuming and cellular data usage. And our caching mechanism mainly consider the resources like CSS and JavaScript files shared among Web pages in a website. Moreover, instead of using RAM, we use ROM, the internal flash memory of devices to store cached resources with proper lifecycle so as to avoid the useful resources to be untimely evicted or expired and thus improve the hit ratio. Our evaluations show that 90% of the homepages and 60% of other pages are fetched before users' visiting, and the page loading time is no more than one second.},

The paper uses the inertial sensors because the current GPS systems are not accurate enough to locate vehicles with a lane level accuracy. The ability to establish a communication channel between vehicles on the same lane can enhance the road safety and enable several interesting navigation applications.},

 abstract = {An appealing solution for unattended surveillance and monitoring applications is Self-powered Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). One of the main reasons is that the energy which is derived from power harvesting can significantly extend the network lifetime. Consequently, the network can work unattended for long periods. However, WSNs are characterized by multi-hop lossy links and resource constrained nodes while they have to face the coexistence problem with other applications. Opportunistic Routing (OR) is a routing paradigm to improve network performance in lossy wireless networks. At the same time, Cognitive Radio (CR) technology enables unlicensed operation in licensed bands. In this work, a combination of these two research approaches in a novel routing protocol is presented. A Spectrum and Energy Aware Opportunistic Routing (SEA-OR) protocol is proposed and designed for Self-powered WSNs. Moreover, a prioritization scheme which balances the packet advancement, the residual energy and the link reliability is introduced. Preliminary results show an improvement in network lifetime and delivery ratio. The performance of the introduced protocol is also evaluated in prototypes.},

 abstract = {Camera communication (CamCom) is a form of visible light communication (VLC) that makes use of a camera as the receiver. One very important advantage of CamCom is that the acquired images during the receiving process provide a means to visually associate the physical object with the transmitted information, since the receiver has the knowledge of which pixels in the images are transmitting. Figure 1 shows a simple example. A user points her smartphone camera at multiple lights, touches the screen to select one, and uses the virtual switch that appears on the screen to adjust the lighting level. In this scenario, the lights simply periodically transmit simple identifiers, such as IP addresses, to the smartphone. The system is able to directly associate what the user sees (the image pixels corresponding to the light selected by the user) to the transmitted information (the identifier of the light). An out-of-band channel, such as WiFi, can then be used to send the actual command to the selected light to adjust the setting. Compared to the conventional approach of identifying a particular set of visual features unique to the object with computer vision techniques, this approach is simpler, more intuitive, and more accurate.},

 abstract = {Diversity in training data density and environment locality is intrinsic in the real-world deployment of indoor localization systems and has a major impact on the performance of existing localization approaches. In this paper, through micro-benchmarks, we find that fingerprint-based approaches are preferable in scenarios where a dense database is available; while model-based approaches are the method of choice in the case of sparse data. It should be noted, however, that practical situations are complex. A single deployment often features both sparse and dense sampled areas. Furthermore, the internal layout affects the propagation of radio signals and exhibits environmental impacts. A certain number of measurement samples may be sufficient for one part of the building, but entirely insufficient for another. Thus, finding the right indoor localization algorithm for a given large-scale deployment is challenging, if not impossible; there is no one-size-fits-all indoor localization approach. Realizing the fundamental fact that the quality of the location database capturing the actual radio map dictates localization accuracy, in this paper, we propose Modellet, an algorithmic approach that optimally approximates the actual radio map by unifying model-based and fingerprint-based approaches. Modellet represents the radio map using a fingerprint-cloud that incorporates both measured real fingerprints and virtual fingerprints, which are computed from models with a local support, based on the key concept of the supporting set. We evaluate Modellet with data collected from an office building as well as 13 large-scale deployment venues (shopping malls and airports), located across China, U.S., and Germany. Comparing Modellet with two representative baseline approaches, RADAR and EZPerfect, demonstrates that Modellet effectively adapts to different data densities and environmental conditions, substantially outperforming existing approaches.},

 abstract = {We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires. The luminaires-modified to allow rapid, on-off keying-transmit their identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical pulses. A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image, decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires. Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position updates. The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be solved with optimization techniques. We explore the feasibility of the design through an analytical model, demonstrate the viability of the design through a prototype system, discuss the challenges to a practical deployment including usability and scalability, and demonstrate decimeter-level accuracy in both carefully controlled and more realistic human mobility scenarios.},

We present WiHear, which enables Wi-Fi signals to "hear" our talks without deploying any devices. To achieve this, WiHear needs to detect and analyze fine-grained radio reflections from mouth movements. WiHear solves this micro-movement detection problem by introducing Mouth Motion Profile that leverages partial multipath effects and wavelet packet transformation. Since Wi-Fi signals do not require line-of-sight, WiHear can "hear" people talks within the radio range. Further, WiHear can simultaneously "hear" multiple people's talks leveraging MIMO technology. We implement WiHear on both USRP N210 platform and commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure. Results show that within our pre-defined vocabulary, WiHear can achieve detection accuracy of 91% on average for single individual speaking no more than 6 words and up to 74% for no more than 3 people talking simultaneously. Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further improved by deploying multiple receivers from different angles.},

In this talk we will explore the new and exciting technologies that Qualcomm Research is working on to advance the frontier in personalized devices and help solve some of these challenges. Starting with always on sensor processing that make basic predictions about where you are and what actions you are performing, to research in brain inspired computing and embedded cognition, Qualcomm is working to make devices which are always with you, smarter and truly personal. To further this vision of transforming the future of mobile computing, Qualcomm Research has also been working in the area of brain inspired computation and neural networks for a number of years. Early work has focused on biologically inspired approaches, involving spiking neural networks and understanding the complex behaviors of the brain. Recent advances in the industry around deep neural networks have resulted in state-of-the-art performance in machine learning pattern matching tasks. As mobile SOCs continue to gain significant computational power, bringing applications powered by deep learning to mobile devices is becoming possible. We will explore the near term opportunities like object recognition, scene classification, applications for smarter mobile cameras, automotive, and robotics. We will also look at other aspects of brain inspired computing including the potential of a new kind of low power hardware. Join Jeff as he shares his insight on how Qualcomm Research has been spearheading research to make future mobile devices smarter with the ability to "sense" and "see" their environment as humans do in a power efficient manner.},

 abstract = {LTE 4G cellular networks are gradually being adopted by all major operators in the world and are expected to rule the cellular landscape at least for the current decade. They will also form the starting point for further progress beyond the current generation of mobile cellular networks to chalk a path towards fifth generation mobile networks. The lack of open cellular ecosystem has limited applied research in this field within the boundaries of vendor and operator R&D groups. Furthermore, several new approaches and technologies are being considered as potential elements making up such a future mobile network, including cloudification of radio network, radio network programability and APIs following SDN principles, native support of machine-type communication, and massive MIMO. Research on these technologies requires realistic and flexible experimentation platforms that offer a wide range of experimentation modes from real-world experimentation to controlled and scalable evaluations while at the same time retaining backward compatibility with current generation systems. In this work, we present OpenAirInterface (OAI) as a suitably flexible platform towards open LTE ecosystem and playground [1]. We will demonstrate an example of the use of OAI to deploy a low-cost open LTE network using commodity hardware with standard LTE-compatible devices. We also show the reconfigurability features of the platform.},

 abstract = {Signal processing on antenna arrays has received much recent attention in the mobile and wireless networking research communities, with array signal processing approaches addressing the problems of human movement detection, indoor mobile device localization, and wireless network security. However, there are two important challenges inherent in the design of these systems that must be overcome if they are to be of practical use on commodity hardware. First, phase differences between the radio oscillators behind each antenna can make readings unusable, and so must be corrected in order for most techniques to yield high-fidelity results. Second, while the number of antennas on commodity access points is usually limited, most array processing increases in fidelity with more antennas. These issues work in synergistic opposition to array processing: without phase offset correction, no phase-difference array processing is possible, and with fewer antennas, automatic correction of these phase offsets becomes even more challenging. We present Phaser, a system that solves these intertwined problems to make phased array signal processing truly practical on the many WiFi access points deployed in the real world. Our experimental results on three- and five-antenna 802.11-based hardware show that 802.11 NICs can be calibrated and synchronized to a 20° median phase error, enabling inexpensive deployment of numerous phase-difference based spectral analysis techniques previously only available on costly, special-purpose hardware.},

This paper proposes BBN, an interference nulling scheme that leverages the high density of access points to enable multiple mobile devices to transmit simultaneously to multiple access points (APs), all within a single collision domain. BBN also leverages the capability of the APs to communicate with each other on the wired backbone to migrate most of the decoding complexity to the APs, while keeping the design at the mobile clients simple. Finally, we leverage the static nature of the access points to make BBN more practical in networks where the mobility of clients inhibit the use of traditional interference alignment schemes. We implement a prototype of BBN on USRP testbed showing its feasibility. The experiment results show that BBN provides a throughput gain of 1.48X over omniscient TDMA. Results from our trace-driven simulations show that BBN obtains a throughput of up to 5.6X over omniscient TDMA.},

Current capacity solutions, including buying spectrum, WiFi offloading, and LTE picocells, are unlikely to supply the orders-of-magnitude bandwidth increase we need. In this paper, we explore a dramatically different alternative in the form of 60GHz mmwave picocells with highly directional links. While industry is investigating other mmwave bands (e.g. 28GHz to avoid oxygen absorption), we prefer the unlicensed 60GHz band with highly directional, short-range links (~100m). 60GHz links truly reap the spatial reuse benefits of small cells while delivering high per-user data rates and leveraging efforts on indoor 60GHz PHY technology and standards. Using extensive measurements on off-the-shelf 60GHz radios and system-level simulations, we explore the feasibility of 60GHz picocells by characterizing range, attenuation due to reflections, sensitivity to movement and blockage, and interference in typical urban environments. Our results dispel some common myths, and show that there are no fundamental physical barriers to high-capacity 60GHz outdoor picocells. We conclude by identifying open challenges and associated research opportunities.},

To highlight the importance of safety metrics and their applicability, we extended our existing simulation framework Veins to visualize these metrics live while the road traffic and network simulation are running in parallel. In particular, we demonstrate the impact of communication on intersection assistance applications. To simulate different intersection approaches, we implemented a simulation model that resembles different kinds of driver behavior and enables crashes at intersections. The resulting situations are displayed in the road traffic simulator and give the visitor insights on the current state of endangered vehicles. Furthermore, an autonomous controller has been implemented which tries to avoid accidents and hence shows the real-world impact, i.e., accidents can be avoided using advanced beaconing techniques. To increase interactivity of the demo, visitors will have the possibility to interact with and take control over endangered vehicles.},

For example, inadequate and irregular sleep are usually associated with serious health problems such as fatigue, depression and cardiovascular disease. Traditional sleep monitoring systems, such as PSG, involve wearable sensors with professional installations, and thus are limited to clinical usage. Recent work in using smartphone sensors for sleep monitoring can detect several events related to sleep, such as body movement, cough and snore. Such coarse-grained sleep monitoring however is unable to detect the breathing rate which is a vital sign and health indicator. This work presents a fine-grained sleep monitoring system which is capable of detecting the breathing rate by leveraging smartphones. Our system exploits the readily available smartphone earphone that placed close to the user to capture the breath sound reliably. Given the captured acoustic signal, our system performs noise reduction to remove environmental noise and then identifies the breathing rate based on the signal envelope detection. Our experimental evaluation of six subjects over six months time period demonstrates that the breathing rate monitoring is highly accurate and robust under various environments. This strongly indicates the feasibility of using the smartphone and its earphone to perform continuous and noninvasive fine-grained sleep monitoring.},

It is the foundation for evaluating software and for operating system based energy management. While various energy accounting policies have been tried, there is no known way to evaluate them directly simply because it is hard to track all hardware usage by software in a heterogeneous multicore system like modern smartphones and tablets. In this work, we argue that energy accounting should be formulated as a cooperative game and that the Shapley value provides the ultimate ground truth for energy accounting policies. We reveal the important flaws of existing energy accounting policies based on the Shapley value theory and provide Shapley value-based energy accounting, a practical approximation of the Shapley value, for battery-powered mobile systems. We evaluate this approximation against existing energy accounting policies in two ways: (i) how well they identify the top energy consuming applications, and (ii) how effective they are in system energy management. Using a prototype based on Texas Instruments Pandaboard and smartphone workload, we experimentally demonstrate existing energy accounting policies can deviate by 400% in attributing energy consumption to running applications and can be up to 25% less effective in system energy management when compared to Shapley value-based energy accounting.},

However, diverse operational conditions due to device hardware diversity (in camera resolution and frame rate) and distance range motivate more scalable designs. In this paper, we borrow the notion of hierarchical modulation from traditional RF communication, and design Strata, a layered coding scheme for visual communication. Strata can support a range of frame capture resolutions and rates, and deliver information rates correspondingly. Strata embeds information at multiple granularity into the same code area spatially or the same frame interval temporally. It ensures all layers are decodable independently, by controlling the amount of interference between adjacent layers. Further, our design is recursive and extends readily to generate more layers.

 abstract = {This paper bridges wireless communication with wireless power transfer. It shows that mobile phones can be charged remotely, while in the user's pocket by applying the concept of MIMO beamforming. However, unlike MIMO beamforming in communication systems which targets the radiated field, we transfer power by beamforming the non-radiated magnetic field and steering it toward the phone. We design MagMIMO, a new system for wireless charging of cell phones and portable devices. MagMIMO consumes as much power as existing solutions, yet it can charge a phone remotely without being removed from the user's pocket. Furthermore, the phone need not face the charging pad, and can charge independently of its orientation. We have built MagMIMO and demonstrated its ability to charge the iPhone and other smart phones, while in the user's pocket.},

 abstract = {Mobile operators are leveraging WiFi to relieve the pressure posed on their networks by the surging bandwidth demand of applications. However, operators often lack intelligent mechanisms to control the way users access their WiFi networks. This lack of sophisticated control creates poor network utilization, which in turn degrades the quality of experience (QoE). To meet user traffic demands, it is evident that operators need solutions that optimally balance user traffic across cellular and WiFi networks. Motivated by the lack of practical solutions in this space, we design and implement ATOM - an end-to-end system for adaptive traffic offloading for WiFi-LTE deployments. ATOM has two novel components: (i) A network interface selection algorithm that maps user traffic across WiFi and LTE to optimize user QoE and (ii) an interface switching service that seamlessly re-directs ongoing user sessions in a cost-effective and standards-compatible manner. Our evaluations on a real LTE-WiFi testbed using YouTube traffic reveals that ATOM reduces video stalls by 3-4 times compared to naive solutions.},

 abstract = {While the UHF band exhibits superior propagation characteristics compared to other frequency bands used for broadband communications, limited spectral availability in time and space necessitates high spectral efficiency techniques such as Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO). In this paper we design and implement the first open MU-MIMO Software-Defined Radio (SDR) platform that operates on an order of magnitude frequency range, from 300 MHz to 5.8 GHz. We perform a comprehensive set of over-the-air experiments to evaluate the potential of UHF-band MU-MIMO in comparison to 2.4 and 5.8 GHz WiFi bands encompassing a range of operating environments. We evaluate MU-MIMO performance in both outdoor, indoor, line-of-sight (LOS), and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, and demonstrate that while the temporal correlation of the measured UHF environment is increased, it does not come at the cost of increased spatial correlation as measured by the Demmel condition number, thus proving highly attractive for MU-MIMO. This evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of MU-MIMO transmission techniques in UHF bands for high spectral efficiency and low-overhead wireless access.},

 abstract = {In wireless networks, location distinction aims to detect location changes or facilitate authentication of wireless users. To achieve location distinction, recent research has been focused on investigating the spatial uncorrelation property of wireless channels. Specifically, the differences of wireless channel characteristics are used to distinguish locations or identify location changes. However, we discover a new attack against all existing location distinction approaches that are built on the spatial uncorrelation property of wireless channels. In such an attack, the adversary can easily hide her location changes or impersonate movements by injecting fake wireless channel characteristics into a target receiver. Experimental results on our USRP-based prototype show that the discovered attack can craft any desired channel characteristic with a successful probability of 95.0% to defeat spatial uncorrelation based location distinction schemes. To defend against this attack, we propose a detection technique that utilizes an auxiliary receiver or antenna to identify these fake channel characteristics. Experiments demonstrate that our novel detection method achieves a detection rate higher than 91.2% while maintaining a very low false alarm rate.},

Traditional approaches involve wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This paper presents device-free location-oriented activity identification at home through the use of existing WiFi access points and WiFi devices (e.g., desktops, thermostats, refrigerators, smartTVs, laptops). Our low-cost system takes advantage of the ever more complex web of WiFi links between such devices and the increasingly fine-grained channel state information that can be extracted from such links. It examines channel features and can uniquely identify both in-place activities and walking movements across a home by comparing them against signal profiles. Signal profiles construction can be semi-supervised and the profiles can be adaptively updated to accommodate the movement of the mobile devices and day-to-day signal calibration. Our experimental evaluation in two apartments of different size demonstrates that our approach can achieve over 96% average true positive rate and less than 1% average false positive rate to distinguish a set of in-place and walking activities with only a single WiFi access point. Our prototype also shows that our system can work with wider signal band (802.11ac) with even higher accuracy.},

 abstract = {Enabling wireless full-duplex (from an AP) with multiple half-duplex (HD) clients is key to widespread adoption of full-duplex (FD) in commercial networks. However, enabling FD in such networks is fundamentally challenged by a new form of uplink-downlink interference (UDI), arising between HD clients operating simultaneously in the uplink and downlink directions. In this context, we first show that spatial interference alignment (IA) between clients is an effective and scalable technique to address UDI and hence enable FD in these networks, especially in the presence of MIMO. We then present our solution and system FDoS: Full-Duplex without Stringsthat incorporates this notion. We build the theory of applying spatial IA to full-duplex networks in general and present elegant, implementation-friendly constructions for generating IA solutions, by leveraging the structure of interference specific to these networks. In the process, FDoS shows that only four HD clients are sufficient to eliminate UDI through IA and enable 2N streams at an N transceiver AP. FDoS also includes an efficient MAC design at the AP to handle clients with heterogeneous antenna capabilities, maximize the throughput of the enabled streams in the FD session as well as reduce the overhead incurred in FDoS by half by facilitating a distributed implementation. A prototype of FDoS on WARP radios showcases its ability to address UDI effectively, and hence enable 2N streams (for N=2,4) in varied settings with just four HD clients, and sustain rate gains of 1.75-2x over HD MU-MIMO systems.},

 abstract = {Security and usability issues with pass-locks on mobile devices have prompted researchers to develop implicit authentication (IA) schemes, which continuously and transparently authenticate users using behavioural biometrics. Contemporary IA schemes proposed by the research community are challenging to deploy, and there is a need for a framework that supports: different behavioural classifiers, given that different apps have different requirements; app developers using IA without becoming domain experts; and real-time classification on resource-constrained mobile devices. We present Itus, an IA framework for Android that allows the research community to improve IA schemes incrementally, while allowing app developers to adopt these improvements at their own pace. We describe the Itus framework and how it provides: ease of use: Itus allows app developers to use IA by changing as few as two lines of their existing code - on the other hand, Itus provides an oracle capable of making advanced recommendations should developers wish to fine-tune the classifiers; flexibility: developers can deploy Itus in an application-specific manner, adapting to their unique needs; extensibility: researchers can contribute new behavioural features and classifiers without worrying about deployment particulars; low performance overhead: Itus operates with minimal performance overhead, allowing app developers to deploy it without compromising end-user experience. These goals are accomplished with an API allowing individual stakeholders to incrementally improve Itus without re-engineering new systems. We implement Itus in two demo apps and measure its performance impact. To our knowledge, Itus is the first open-source extensible IA framework for Android that can be deployed off-the-shelf.},

 abstract = {Welcome to ACM MobiCom 2013, the 19th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking. Over the years, MobiCom has established itself as a premier forum for publishing and presenting cutting-edge research in mobile systems and wireless networks, and this year's final program continues this wonderful tradition. The high quality and success of MobiCom can be credited to two groups. First and foremost is the authors of all of the submitted papers who submitted their very best research ideas and results. The 28 accepted papers represent leading-edge, and sometimes bleeding-edge, advances in a large variety of important mobile computing topics -- from traditional yet still very important topics, such as improving the efficiency of cellular and Wi-Fi networks, to topics focusing on the use of new wireless technologies in new mobile environments, such as enabling gesture recognition, managing indoor white space networks, and deploying performance improving femto cells. However, the hidden strength of MobiCom comes from the hard work of a very dedicated program committee, which consisted of 41 members from academia, government and industry spread across 7 different countries with expertise in many areas relevant to wireless networking and mobile computing. As Program Committee (PC) chairs, it was our task to keep MobiCom fresh and grow it to keep up with all the new challenges of the wireless and mobile community. This year, we introduced several new initiatives to further enhance the reach and quality of the conference. To increase MobiCom's visibility in industry, we included five PC members from product teams of Cisco, Google, Qualcomm and Broadcom. To ensure the strength and breadth, but most importantly the vision, of the PC, one-sixth of the PC were new members who had previously not served on the MobiCom PC. This year's MobiCom also has an invited industry session, in which speakers from Broadcom, Alcatel-Lucent, Google, and Microsoft will present the latest results and research challenges from industry in an effort to bridge the gap between academic research and how it is, or maybe isn't, relevant to industry. This year's call for papers attracted 207 submissions from five continents: Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America. We used HotCRP for handling the paper submission and reviewing, which was done in three phases. In the first phase, each paper was reviewed by at least three PC members, and the top 98 papers were selected for the next round. In the second phase, each paper was reviewed by at least two more PC members. In some cases when the paper was at the intersection of new topics, such as RADAR or robotics, additional expert opinions were solicited. The final phase was the PC meeting held on May 30th and 31st in Redmond, WA. A total of 34 members attended the PC meeting in-person, while 5 members attended the meeting on Skype. Over one and a half days, the PC extensively discussed the merits and flaws of the 60 toprated papers and ultimately accepted 28 papers for final publication in the conferences' proceedings. Across the three phases, each PC member reviewed about 25 papers, such that most round two papers had an average of 6 reviews (a high number for any top-tier conference). To ensure fairness and preserve the anonymity of all authors and reviewers, papers authored by PC chairs were mixed with a random selection of other papers and handled out-of-band by Alex Snoeren, who was the PC co-chair for MobiCom 2012.},

 abstract = {In this work, we explore a new networking mechanism with smart glasses, through which users can express their interest and connect to a target simply by a gaze. Doing this, we attempt to let wearable devices understand human attention and intention, and pair devices carried by users according to such attention and intention. To achieve this ambitious goal, we propose a proof-of-concept system iGaze, a visual attention driven networking suite: an iGaze glass (hardware), and a networking protocol VAN (software). Our glass, iGaze glass, is a low-cost head-mounted glass with a camera, orientation sensors, microphone and speakers, which are embedded with our software for visual attention capture and networking. A visual attention driven networking protocol (VAN) is carefully designed and implemented. In VAN, we design an energy efficient and highly accurate visual attention determination scheme using single camera to capture user's communication interest and a double-matching scheme based on visual direction detection and Doppler effect of acoustic signal to lock the target devices. Using our system, we conduct a series of trials for various application scenarios to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.},

 abstract = {Implementing distributed wireless protocols at the physical layer today is challenging because different nodes have different clocks, each of which has slightly different frequencies. This causes the nodes to have frequency offset relative to each other. As a result, transmitted signals from these nodes do not combine in a predictable manner over time. Past work tackles this challenge and builds distributed PHY layer systems by attempting to address the effects of the frequency offset and compensating for it in the transmitted signals. In this extended abstract, we address this challenge by addressing the root cause - the different clocks with different frequencies on the different nodes. We present AirClock, a new wireless coordination primitive that enables multiple nodes to act as if they are driven by a single clock that they receive wirelessly over the air. AirClock presents a synchronized abstraction to the physical layer, and hence enables direct implementation of diverse kinds of distributed PHY protocols. We illustrate AirClock's versatility by using it to build two different systems: (1) distributed MIMO, and (2) distributed rate adaptation for wireless sensors, and show that they can provide significant performance benefits over today's systems.},

In the future, USB can be utilized with the Wi-Fi technology to provide Wi-Fi USB (WSB). However, the data transmission of Wi-Fi and USB are asynchronous due to their different Medium Access Control (MAC) characteristics, which may result in buffer overflow. To prevent buffer overflow, we propose an adaptive flow control scheme that can select between the various transmission speeds of USB to match with the bandwidth provided by the Wi-Fi layer. Preliminary results of the proposed scheme evaluated via the NS-3 shows that the packet delivery ratio of USB data can be substantially increased, thus providing better USB reliability.},

The corner detection accuracy has been identified as a critical factor affecting the overall system performance. The standard barcode detector performs a candidate search in the binarized barcode image based on the rectangular shape of the barcode. Its performance is not very accurate due to the limited accuracy of the binarized image. In this work, we proposed a coarse-fine corner detection approach for locating the barcode region. It performs far more accurately than the standard barcode detection scheme while keeps the computational complexity affordable. Experimental results for high capacity barcodes show that the proposed detection scheme can extend the range of operation parameters, such as wider angles, and much lower the detection bit error rate, relative to the standard barcode decoder.},

 abstract = {Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) is defined in IEEE 802.11 standard, which is widely used in practice. Despite of its wide use, it has several limitations. Because of the idle and collision times, it suffers from poor channel utilization. Besides, the control packets, particularly, Acknowledgement (ACK), consume non-trivial amount of bandwidth. Though the number of control bits in an ACK frame is small, the added overheads like the preamble, packet header etc. make the situation worse. In this paper, we propose a scheme called Overheard ACK where the explicit ACK frame has been eliminated by using the leverage of packet overhearing. Also, by incorporating explicit and implicit token-passing, this protocol attempts to schedule transmissions without having to use random access, dramatically reducing the idle time and collision time. Simulation results using NS2 confirm that this protocol significantly outperforms the conventional 802.11 DCF.},

In our demonstration, we will exhibit a fully embedded and FCC-certified white space networking platform that is available and capable of building out TV white space networks. Additionally, we provide an interactive display with data taken from our commercial deployments that further show its capabilities of supporting various applications. Using the many available channels at the conference location, we will demonstrate some of these capabilities (e.g., ability to penetrate in-door environments), as well as future capabilities (e.g., novel functionality built on the platform). With an open-API (across all layers), the platform is conducive to studying current capabilities and novel research.},

 abstract = {This paper argues for a clean-slate redesign of wireless sensor systems to take advantage of the extremely low power consumption of backscatter communication and emerging ultra-low power sensor modalities. We make the case that existing sensing architectures incur substantial overhead for a variety of computational blocks between the sensor and RF front end - while these overheads were negligible on platforms where communication was expensive, they become the bottleneck on backscatter-based systems and increase power consumption while limiting throughput. We present a radically new design that is minimalist, yet efficient, and designed to operate end-to-end at tens of μWs while enabling high-data rate backscatter at rates upwards of many hundreds of Kbps. In addition, we demonstrate a complex reader-driven MAC layer that jointly considers energy, channel conditions, data utility, and platform constraints to enable network-wide throughput optimizations. We instantiate this architecture on a custom FPGA-based platform connected to microphones, and show that the platform consumes 73x lower power and has 12.5x higher throughput than existing backscatter-based sensing platforms.},

 abstract = {To conserve power while ensuring good performance on resource-constrained mobile devices, devices transition between different Radio Resource Control (RRC) states in response to network traffic and according to parameters specific to network operators. As RRC states significantly affect application power consumption and performance, it is important to understand how RRC state timers interact with network traffic patterns. In this paper, we show that the impact of RRC states on performance is significantly more complex and diverse than found in previous work. To do so, we introduce an open-source tool that allows the impact of RRC states on network and application performance to be measured in a robust and accurate manner on unmodified user devices, and deploy the tool in 23 countries around the world to test a broad range of cellular network technologies. We detect previously unknown performance problems which increase network latencies by up to several seconds and for LTE, can increase packet losses by an order of magnitude. Through an in-depth cross-layer analysis of several carriers, we examine the lower-layer causes of these problems. We determine that the highly complex state transitions of certain carriers, and in particular poor interactions between state demotions and network traffic, can lead to substantial, unexpected latencies.},

@proceedings{Lee:2014:2639108,
 abstract = {Welcome to the 20th Edition of MobiCom, the Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking. Now past its teens, MobiCom continues to grow as the powerhouse conference with a vibrant, dedicated and growing community of researchers and practitioners in mobile systems and wireless networks. 36 Accepted Papers: Any research community is judged by the quality of its work and the impact of that work on actual practice. On both those counts, MobiCom 2014 is set to build on the fantastic tradition of previous years. This year's program has 36 high-quality papers, which is the highest number ever accepted. The increase in final number of papers accepted is a sign of widening of the program scope and growth of the research community. The papers range from traditional topics which continue to be of critical interest - like Wireless LANs, cellular networks and others and new emerging areas of wireless charging, visual communications and wireless data-centers among many others. The acceptance rate was 16.4% (36/220). TPC Composition: MobiCom is "notoriously" famous for its brutally rigorous review process, which is perhaps the key reason why authors tend to submit their best work to MobiCom. The "guardians of quality" have always been the Technical Program Committee (TPC). To ensure we have topical experts in all major categories, we expanded the TPC to 51 members, again the biggest TPC in MobiCom history. The TPC included 13 members from industry - Microsoft Research, Facebook, Google, Narus, NEC Labs, HP Labs, Alcatel Lucent and Intel Labs, a member from National Science Foundation and a member from IMDEA. Furthermore, 6 members are from Europe, 4 from Asia-Pacific, 1 from Africa and rest from North Americas. Review Process: This year, we also added two new elements to the review process - conditional accepts and anonymous shepherding. The call for papers attracted 220 papers (after rejecting nonconforming papers) from five continents: Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America. The review process was conducted in 4 phases using the HotCRP system, where the first three phases were identical to previous years'. In the first phase, each paper was reviewed by at least 3 TPC members. After the first round of review, the reviewers discussed the papers online and the consensus decision was marked for each paper. After the first phase, 76 papers were moved to the second phase of reviews. In the second phase, at least 2 more TPC members provided additional reviews. In the second round, we asked the first round reviewers to provide suggestions for most suitable TPC member for second round reviews. In addition, we also sought their suggestion for external reviewers if there was a need for additional expert opinion. After the second round review and online discussions, 68 papers were selected to be the part of third phase -- the TPC meeting discussion. The TPC meeting was held at Rice University on May 29-30, 2014. The one and a half day meeting was attended by 46 members in person and 5 members joined via conference call. To ensure fairness and preserve the anonymity of all authors and reviewers, papers authored by PC chairs were mixed with a random selection of other papers and were handled out of band by Raghupathy Sivakumar and Nitin Vaidya. The reviews were handled using the HotCRP system using "tokens," a mechanism designed to keep the reviewers anonymous even from the chairs. The related discussions were handled out-of-band over emails between the reviewers. A total of 10 such papers were handled out-of-band of which 5 were discussed at the TPC meeting. Note that these numbers are included in the above paragraph. The chairs did not participate in any awards committees. New Elements in the Review Process: At the start of the TPC meeting, the TPC Chairs informed all TPC members that there is no preset target for the number of accepted papers. That allowed the TPC members to focus only on the paper under discussion and whether they consider it as MobiCom quality or not. In addition, the TPC members were informed that all papers will only be conditionally accepted, till the authors adequately address all reviewers' concerns. The conditional accept was the first new element in the review process, unlike prior years in which the final decision was made in the TPC meeting itself. At the end of the two-day meeting, 38 papers were conditionally accepted. Two conditionally accepted papers were appealed within 24 hours of the meeting, as the TPC members found additional support to reject those papers. An online discussion followed and a consensus decision was reached to reject the two appealed papers. Thus, the TPC members continued to work even after the TPC meeting was over! The second new element was that of double-blind shepherding, which was a departure from previous years where the double-blind barrier was removed between shepherds and authors after the TPC meeting. The two new elements, conditional accept and double-blind shepherding, were added to address the general feeling in the community that the authors tend to make only minimal changes after they get their accept notification. Further, in the old method, the shepherds had no power to enforce necessary changes, since the authors know their identities and authors know that their papers are accepted. The new process, while very cumbersome to implement due to lack of adequate support in HotCRP, was appreciated by many members. The authors, knowing that their paper can be rejected, worked wonders in revising and addressing all concerns. And shepherds felt empowered to conduct their job without any fear of retribution. A very small number of papers were in fact very close to being rejected during the shepherding process, but were ultimately kept in the program after much discussion among TPC members. Some papers underwent significant revisions and within a course of three weeks, they were revised several times to address all concerns. For the first time, we got written comments like "Wow, the authors put in some serious work to revise the paper." As TPC Chairs, we could not be more elated with the result of the new changes.},

 abstract = {Networks are constantly generating an enormous amount of rich diverse information. Such information creates exciting opportunities for network analytics. However, a major challenge to enable effective network analytics is the presence of missing data, measurement errors, and anomalies. Despite significant work in network analytics, fundamental issues remain: (i) the existing works do not explicitly account for anomalies or measurement noise, and incur serious performance degradation under significant noise or anomalies, and (ii) they assume network matrices have low-rank structure, which may not hold in reality. To address these issues, in this paper we develop LENS decomposition, a novel technique to accurately decompose a network matrix into a low-rank matrix, a sparse anomaly matrix, an error matrix, and a small noise matrix. LENS has the following nice properties: (i) it is general: it can effectively support matrices with or without anomalies, and having low-rank or not, (ii) its parameters are self tuned so that it can adapt to different types of data, (iii) it is accurate by incorporating domain knowledge, such as temporal locality, spatial locality, and initial estimate (e.g., obtained from models), (iv) it is versatile and can support many applications including missing value interpolation, prediction, and anomaly detection. We apply LENS to a wide range of network matrices from 3G, WiFi, mesh, sensor networks, and the Internet. Our results show that LENS significantly out-performs state-of-the-art compressive sensing schemes.},

Specifically, it gives receivers a way to provide low-rate feedback to the transmitter on the same frequency as that of the backscatter transmissions, using neither multiple antennas nor power-consuming cancellation hardware. Our design achieves this goal using only fully-passive analog components that consume near-zero power. We integrate our design with the backscatter network stack and demonstrate that it can minimize energy wastes that occur due to collisions and also correct for errors and changes in channel conditions at a granularity smaller than that of a packet. To show the feasibility of our design, we build a hardware prototype using off-the-shelf analog components. Our evaluation shows that our design cancels the self-interference down to the noise floor, while consuming only 0.25 μW and 0.54 μW of transmit and receive power, respectively.},

 abstract = {We explore the indoor positioning problem with unmodified smartphones and slightly-modified commercial LED luminaires. The luminaires - modified to allow rapid, on-off keying - transmit their identifiers and/or locations encoded in human-imperceptible optical pulses. A camera-equipped smartphone, using just a single image frame capture, can detect the presence of the luminaires in the image, decode their transmitted identifiers and/or locations, and determine the smartphone's location and orientation relative to the luminaires. Continuous image capture and processing enables continuous position updates. The key insights underlying this work are (i) the driver circuits of emerging LED lighting systems can be easily modified to transmit data through on-off keying; (ii) the rolling shutter effect of CMOS imagers can be leveraged to receive many bits of data encoded in the optical transmissions with just a single frame capture, (iii) a camera is intrinsically an angle-of-arrival sensor, so the projection of multiple nearby light sources with known positions onto a camera's image plane can be framed as an instance of a sufficiently-constrained angle-of-arrival localization problem, and (iv) this problem can be solved with optimization techniques.},

 abstract = {In an 802.11ac-based MU-MIMO network comprised of multiple cells1, inter-cell interference allows only a single AP to serve its clients at the same time, significantly limiting the network capacity. In this work, we overcome this limitation by letting the APs and clients in interfering cells coordinately cancel the inter-cell interference using their antennas for beamforming. To achieve such coordinated interference cancellation in a practical way, we propose a novel two-step optimization. First, without requiring any channel knowledge, each AP and client optimizes the use of its antennas for either data communication or inter-cell interference cancellation, in order to maximize the total number of deliverable streams in the MU-MIMO network. Second, with only partial channel knowledge, each AP and client optimizes their beamforming weights after the optimal antenna usage has been identified in the first step. Our solution, CoaCa, integrates this two-step optimization into 802.11ac with small modifications and negligible overhead, allowing each AP and client to locally perform the two-step optimization. Our experimental evaluation indicates that for a MU-MIMO network with two cells, by cancelling the inter-cell interference CoaCa can convert the majority of the expected number of streams increase (50%-67%) into network capacity improvement (41%-52%).},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of tracking physical browsing by users in indoor spaces such as retail stores. Analogous to online browsing, where users choose to go to certain webpages, dwell on a subset of pages of interest to them, and click on links of interest while ignoring others, we can draw parallels in the physical setting, where a user might walk purposefully to a section of interest, dwell there for a while, gaze at specific items, and reach out for the ones that they wish to examine more closely. As our first contribution, we design techniques to track each of these elements of physical browsing using a combination of a first-person vision enabled by smart glasses, and inertial sensing using both the glasses and a smartphone. We address key challenges, including energy efficiency by using the less expensive inertial sensors to trigger the more expensive vision processing. Second, during gazing, we present a method for identifying the item(s) within view that the user is likely to focus on based on measuring the orientation of the user's head. Finally, unlike in the online context, where every webpage is just a click away, proximity is important in the physical browsing setting. To enable the tracking of nearby items, even if outside the field of view, we use data gathered from smart-glasses-enabled users to infer the product layout using a novel technique called AutoLayout. Further, we show how such inferences made from a small population of smart-glasses-enabled users could aid in tracking the physical browsing by the many smartphone-only users.},

Current history-based WLAN protocols do not work well in mobile settings where wireless conditions change rapidly. Thus, today's WLANs need to be able to determine the type of the client's mobility and employ appropriate strategies in order to sustain high performance. While previous work tried to detect mobility using hints from sensors available in mobile devices, in this work, we demonstrate how different mobility modes can be distinguished by using physical layer information - Channel State Information (CSI) and Time-of-Flight (ToF) - available at commodity APs, with no modifications on the client side. Our testbed experiments show that our mobility classification algorithm achieves more than 92% accuracy in a variety of scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate how fine-grained mobility determination can be exploited to greatly improve performance of client roaming and MIMO beamforming.},

For example, by embedding navigation information into the road surface we could enable driverless cars, similarly embedding information into major infrastructure such as building walls would enable easier classification of debris, and so forth. The key requirement is that the embedded information should survive as long as the infrastructure itself. We discuss the concept of wireless barcodes that allow us to achieve exactly this goal of tagging infrastructure. The barcodes are designed to be read at terahertz frequencies that allows good packing of information (bits/m). We use a TDoA (Time Difference of Arrival) technique to read the barcodes which provides robustness to wear and tear of the surface.

 abstract = {In many applications, we have to identify an object and then locate the object to within high precision (centimeter- or millimeter-level). Legacy systems that can provide such accuracy are either expensive or suffering from performance degradation resulting from various impacts, e.g., occlusion for computer vision based approaches. In this work, we present an RFID-based system, Tagoram, for object localization and tracking using COTS RFID tags and readers. Tracking mobile RFID tags in real time has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving high precision. Our system achieves these three goals by leveraging the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers, to estimate the location of the object. In Tagoram, we exploit the tag's mobility to build a virtual antenna array by using readings from a few physical antennas over a time window. To illustrate the basic idea of our system, we firstly focus on a simple scenario where the tag is moving along a fixed track known to the system. We propose Differential Augmented Hologram (DAH) which will facilitate the instant tracking of the mobile RFID tag to a high precision. We then devise a comprehensive solution to accurately recover the tag's moving trajectories and its locations, relaxing the assumption of knowing tag's track function in advance. We have implemented the Tagoram system using COTS RFID tags and readers. The system has been tested extensively in the lab environment and used for more than a year in real airline applications. For lab environment, we can track the mobile tags in real time with a millimeter accuracy to a median of 5mm and 7.29mm using linear and circular track respectively. In our year- long large scale baggage sortation systems deployed in two airports, our results from real deployments show that Tagoram can achieve a centimeter-level accuracy to a median of 6.35cm in these real deployments.},

 abstract = {The present TV whitespace networks rely on spectrum occupancy databases to determine their operating channels. In this paper, we show that such databases cause non-negligible wastage of whitespace spectrum. We also report that whitespace channels can have very different quality due to interference from secondary devices and the leakage from TV broadcasts. Such disparity in channel quality is not captured by existing databases. We propose the use of spectrum measurements to overcome the above limitations of databases. In particular, we describe a system called V-Scope that leverages spectrum sensors on public vehicles to collect and report measurements from the road. These measurements are used as "anchor points" to construct various models to better determine whitespace spectrum, estimate its channel quality, and validate locations of primary and secondary devices. We have deployed our system on a single metro bus traveling across a mid-sized US city. Based on measurements collected at above 1 million locations over 120 square-km area, we find that a commercial database causes under-utilization of certain whitespace channels over a large area (up to 71% measured locations). Our system can reclaim this spectrum wastage at up to 59% locations, correctly selecting all the suitable whitespace channels at 72 -- 83% locations, and achieving a localization accuracy between 16 -- 27m.},
