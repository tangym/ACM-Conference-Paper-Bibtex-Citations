 abstract = {Mobile apps that use sensors to monitor user behavior often employ resource heavy inference algorithms that make computational offloading a common practice. However, existing schedulers/offloaders typically emphasize one primary offloading aspect without fully exploring complementary goals (e.g., heterogeneous resource management with only partial visibility into underlying algorithms, or concurrent sensor app execution on a single resource) and as a result, may overlook performance benefits pertinent to sensor processing. We bring together key ideas scattered in existing offloading solutions to build LEO -- a scheduler designed to maximize the performance for the unique workload of continuous and intermittent mobile sensor apps without changing their inference accuracy. LEO makes use of domain specific signal processing knowledge to smartly distribute the sensor processing tasks across the broader range of heterogeneous computational resources of high-end phones (CPU, co-processor, GPU and the cloud). To exploit short-lived, but substantial optimization opportunities, and remain responsive to the needs of near real-time apps such as voice-based natural user interfaces, LEO runs as a service on a low-power co-processor unit (LPU) to perform both frequent and joint schedule optimization for concurrent pipelines. Depending on the workload and network conditions, LEO is between 1.6 and 3 times more energy efficient than conventional cloud offloading with CPU-bound sensor sampling. In addition, even if a general-purpose scheduler is optimized directly to leverage an LPU, we find LEO still uses only a fraction (< 1/7) of the energy overhead for scheduling and is up to 19% more energy efficient for medium to heavy workloads.},

 abstract = {3D orientation tracking is an essential ingredient for many Internet-of-Things applications. Yet existing orientation tracking systems commonly require motion sensors that are only available on battery-powered devices. In this paper, we propose Tagyro, which attaches an array of passive RFID tags as orientation sensors on everyday objects. Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle. To enable orientation tracking in 3D space, we found the key challenge lies in the imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags, caused by the antenna polarity, non-isotropic emission and electromagnetic coupling, which substantially distort phase measurement. We address these challenges by designing a set of phase sampling and recovery algorithms, which together enable reliable orientation sensing with 3 degrees of freedom. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. Our experiments show that Tagyro can track the 3D orientation of passive objects with a small error of 4°, at a processing rate of 37.7 samples per second.},

In this paper we answer these questions through a comprehensive comparison of IPv4 and IPv6 mobile Web performance in cellular networks in the US from the point of view of Akamai's content delivery infrastructure. Our data show that IPv6 hosting outperforms legacy IPv4 paths in mobile Web. Our analysis leads to clear recommendations for CPs to transition to IPv6-hosted mobile Web.

 abstract = {Video streaming is a prevalent mobile service that drains a significant amount of battery power. While various efforts have been made toward saving both video transfer and display energy, they are independently designed in an ad-hoc way and thereby can cause some non-apparent yet critical performance issues. To fill in this gap, this paper presents a fundamentally new design by jointly considering the end-to-end pipeline from the initial video encoding to the final mobile display. In essence, we shift the classic R-D tradeoff that has governed streaming system designs for decades to a fresh rate-distortion-energy (R-D-E) tradeoff specifically tailored for mobile devices. We present RnB, a video bitrate and display brightness adaptation platform that is standard-compliant, backward compatible, and device-neutral in order to achieve the proposed R-D-E tradeoff. RnB is empowered by some new discovery about the inherent relationship among bitrate, display brightness, and video quality as well as by an control-theoretic formulation to dynamically adapt the bitrate and scale the display brightness. Experimental results based on real-time implementation show that RnB can achieve an average of 19% energy reduction with final video quality comparable to conventional R-D based schemes.},

 abstract = {Inertial sensors continuously track the 3D orientation of a flying drone, serving as the bedrock for maneuvers and stabilization. However, even the best inertial measurement units (IMU) are prone to various types of correlated failures. We consider using multiple GPS receivers on the drone as a fail-safe mechanism for IMU failures. The core challenge is in accurately computing the relative locations between each receiver pair, and translating these measurements into the drone's 3D orientation. Achieving IMU-like orientation requires the relative GPS distances to be accurate to a few centimeters -- a difficult task given that GPS today is only accurate to around 1-4 meters. Moreover, GPS-based orientation needs to be precise even under sharp drone maneuvers, GPS signal blockage, and sudden bouts of missing data. This paper designs SafetyNet, an off-the-shelf GPS-only system that addresses these challenges through a series of techniques, culminating in a novel particle filter framework running over multi-GNSS systems (GPS, GLONASS, and SBAS). Results from 11 sessions of 5-7 minute flights report median orientation accuracies of 2° even under overcast weather conditions. Of course, these improvements arise from an increase in cost due to the multiple GPS receivers, however, when safety is of interest, we believe that tradeoff is worthwhile.},

Second, we identify a new research problem of multipath-aware CDN server selection. We demonstrate its real-world importance and provide recommendations. Third, our measurement findings lead us to design and implement a flexible software architecture for mobile multipath called MPFlex, which strategically employs multiplexing to improve multipath performance (by up to 63% for short-lived flows).

 abstract = {Multilateration techniques have been proposed to verify the integrity of unprotected location claims in wireless localization systems. A common assumption is that the adversary is equipped with only a single device from which it transmits location spoofing signals. In this paper, we consider a more advanced model where the attacker is equipped with multiple devices and performs a geographically distributed coordinated attack on the multilateration system. The feasibility of a distributed multi-device attack is demonstrated experimentally with a self-developed attack implementation based on multiple COTS software-defined radio (SDR) devices. We launch an attack against the OpenSky Network, an air traffic surveillance system that implements a time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) multi-lateration method for aircraft localization based on ADS-B signals. Our experiments show that the timing errors for distributed spoofed signals are indistinguishable from the multilateration errors of legitimate aircraft signals, indicating that the threat of multi-device spoofing attacks is real in this and other similar systems. In the second part of this work, we investigate physical-layer features that could be used to detect multi-device attacks. We show that the frequency offset and transient phase noise of the attacker's radio devices can be exploited to discriminate between a received signal that has been transmitted by a single (legitimate) transponder or by multiple (malicious) spoofing sources. Based on that, we devise a multi-device spoofing detection system that achieves zero false positives and a false negative rate below 1%.},

We introduce passive sensor tags that allow to easily and seamlessly add new sensors to existing IoT deployments without requiring hardware modifications or additional energy sources. Passive sensor tags employ backscatter communication to generate transmissions that can be decoded by the radio transceivers present in today's IoT devices. Furthermore, unlike recent works, our approach does not require dedicated infrastructure to generate the unmodulated carrier used for backscatter communication. The demo showcases our prototype of a passive sensor tag collecting sensor data and delivering it to unmodified commodity IoT devices using passive 802.15.4 transmissions.},

 abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) is used ubiquitously in a wide variety of applications ranging from navigation and tracking to modern smart grids and communication networks. However, it has been demonstrated that modern GPS receivers are vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. For example, today it is possible to change the course of a ship or force a drone to land in a hostile area by simply spoofing GPS signals. Several countermeasures have been proposed in the past to detect GPS spoofing attacks. These counter-measures offer protection only against naive attackers. They are incapable of detecting strong attackers such as those capable of seamlessly taking over a GPS receiver, which is currently receiving legitimate satellite signals, and spoofing them to an arbitrary location. Also, there is no hardware platform that can be used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of existing countermeasures in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present SPREE, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first GPS receiver capable of detecting all spoofing attacks described in the literature. Our novel spoofing detection technique called auxiliary peak tracking enables detection of even a strong attacker capable of executing the seamless takeover attack. We implement and evaluate our receiver against three different sets of GPS signal traces: (i) a public repository of spoofing traces, (ii) signals collected through our own wardriving effort and (iii) using commercial GPS signal generators. Our evaluations show that SPREE constraints even a strong attacker (capable of seamless takeover attack) from spoofing the receiver to a location not more than 1 km away from its true location. This is a significant improvement over modern GPS receivers that can be spoofed to any arbitrary location. Finally, we release our implementation and datasets to the community for further research and development.},

Similarly to other prominent examples of WiFi usage like enterprise and home settings, public WLANs could also benefit from an SDN-based coordinated management framework that deals with issues like interference and mobility management. However, unlike these settings, public WLANs present a few differences in their characteristics, such as the need to offer location-aware services and dynamic categorization of users, and the consequent need to provide sophisticated association strategies. Motivated by this we propose VALI, an SDN management framework tailored to meet the needs of public WLAN settings.

In this paper, we propose LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency ( > 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. Our experiments demonstrate LiTell's high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and its potential to achieve sub-meter location granularity. Our user study in a multi-storey office building, parking lot and grocery store further validates LiTell as an accurate, robust and ready-to-use indoor localization system.},

Typically, these applications need predefined features and are only applicable to predefined activities. In this work, we address the issue of deep understanding of arbitrary activities and semantic searching of any activity over massive mobile sensing data. The challenges stem from the rich dynamics and the wide-spectrum of activities that a human being could perform. We propose a hierarchical activity representation, extract common bases of motion data in an unsupervised manner by leveraging the power of deep neural networks, and propose a universal multi-resolution representation for all activities without prior knowledge. Based on this representation, we design an innovative system Lasagna to manage and search motion data semantically. We implement a prototype system and our comprehensive evaluations show that our system can achieve highly accurate activity classification (with precision 98.9%) and search (with recall almost 100% and precision about 90%) over a diverse set of activities.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a near-ultrasound chirp signal-based communication for the TV's 2nd screen services. While near-ultrasound (with under 20 kHz frequency) communication has been developed for various applications recently, none of the previous work provides a perfect solution for 2nd screen services between TVs and smart devices. This is due mainly to the following real world challenges. The embedded signal in TV contents should be successfully received in a typical TV-watching environment by (i) delivering information at least at 15 bps with significantly low volume to avoid human perception, (ii) despite the presence of ambient noise, e.g., a tick, a snap, or a knock. To fulfill (i), we design chirp quaternary orthogonal keying (QOK) symbols. Especially, we aim to minimize inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects by symbol design in order to completely eliminate guard intervals. To resolve (ii), we propose the novel J-shape detection algorithms for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing. The proposed modem achieves almost zero frame error rate on a smartphone 2.7 m away from the TV even with minimal receive sound pressure level of 35 dBSPL, i.e., the noise level in a very quiet room. Moreover, throughout experiments and log analysis of 2nd screen service deployed in a nation-wide TV broadcasting system, J-shape detection algorithms are proven to achieve highly resilient performance for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing compared to previous schemes.},

To address this issue, we propose TKL-WinSMS as a systematic strategy, which is able to realize robust and adaptive localization in dynamic indoor environments. We developed a WiFi-based Non-intrusive Sensing and Monitoring System (WinSMS) that enables COTS WiFi routers as online reference points by extracting real-time RSS readings among them. With these online data and labeled source data from the offline calibrated radio map, we further combine the RSS readings from target mobile devices as unlabeled target data, to design a robust localization model using an emerging transfer learning algorithm, namely transfer kernel learning (TKL). It can learn a domain-invariant kernel by directly matching the source and target distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space instead of the raw noisy signal space. By leveraging the resultant kernel as input for the SVR training, the trained localization model can inherit the information from online phase to adaptively enhance the offline calibrated radio map. Extensive experimental results verify the superiority of TKL-WinSMS in terms of localization accuracy compared with existing solutions in dynamic indoor environments.},

 abstract = {Welcome to ACM MobiCom 2015, the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking. MobiCom is the premier forum for publishing and presenting cutting-edge research in mobile systems and wireless networks. The technical program this year features 38 outstanding papers that cover a wide variety of topics including energy, sensing, security, wireless access, applications, localization, Internet of things, mobile cloud, measurement and analysis. We created a new Experience track this year to encourage authors to present extensive experiences with implementation, deployment, and operations of mobile ncomputing and wireless networks. One of the accepted papers is an Experience paper on cellular networks. This year's call for papers attracted 207 qualified submissions from across the globe that were carefully reviewed by 46 Technical Program Committee (TPC) members (+2 TPC chairs) along with a selected group of external experts. The TPC was formed with the goal of covering diverse research expertise as well as diverse perspectives and approaches. The TPC included researchers from 12 countries including China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA. 25% of the members were female, the highest ever in the history of MobiCom. We also had broad industry participation with TPC members from Alcatel-Lucent, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, and Telefonica. The paper review process was double-blinded and carried out in three phases. In the first phase, each paper was reviewed by at least three TPC members, and the top 112 papers were selected for the second phase. In addition to reviewer scores, reviewer confidence and normalization with respect to other papers in a reviewer's pile, were also considered in selecting papers. In the second phase, each paper was reviewed by at least two more reviewers followed by an online, often intense, discussion, producing 68 papers for the final phase. The final TPC meeting was held on May 28th and 29th in Salt Lake City, Utah. These 68 papers were organized by their topic areas, and discussed at length at the meeting. Eventually, 38 papers were shortlisted for inclusion in the program and a shepherd from the TPC was assigned to each of these papers. As the last step, each of the shortlisted papers was shepherded through a "blind" process where the authors interacted with all the reviewers and the shepherd to address the review comments without knowing the reviewers' or the shepherds' identities. The end result is an exciting technical program composed of 38 very high quality papers. During the review process, Prof. Robin Kravets, the TPC co-chair of MobiCom 2013, handled the papers that were co-authored by TPC chairs, and those that had conflict-of-interest with both TPC chairs. To ensure fairness and preserve the anonymity of all authors and reviewers, the assignment of reviewers, the reviews and discussions of these papers were done out of band without any exposure to the TPC chairs.},

 abstract = {Device-free gesture tracking is an enabling HCI mechanism for small wearable devices because fingers are too big to control the GUI elements on such small screens, and it is also an important HCI mechanism for medium-to-large size mobile devices because it allows users to provide input without blocking screen view. In this paper, we propose LLAP, a device-free gesture tracking scheme that can be deployed on existing mobile devices as software, without any hardware modification. We use speakers and microphones that already exist on most mobile devices to perform device-free tracking of a hand/finger. The key idea is to use acoustic phase to get fine-grained movement direction and movement distance measurements. LLAP first extracts the sound signal reflected by the moving hand/finger after removing the background sound signals that are relatively consistent over time. LLAP then measures the phase changes of the sound signals caused by hand/finger movements and then converts the phase changes into the distance of the movement. We implemented and evaluated LLAP using commercial-off-the-shelf mobile phones. For 1-D hand movement and 2-D drawing in the air, LLAP has a tracking accuracy of 3.5 mm and 4.6 mm, respectively. Using gesture traces tracked by LLAP, we can recognize the characters and short words drawn in the air with an accuracy of 92.3% and 91.2%, respectively.},

We present the ambiguity problem of the Doppler monitoring system. We find that RSS from a wireless network is complimentary to Doppler signal, and we propose to integrate Doppler with RSS to make respiration monitoring more robust. Our experimental results show that the respiration rate estimation is more accurate by sensor fusion of these two radio frequency (RF) sensing modalities.},

 abstract = {We propose and demonstrate accurate 3D real-time indoor localization via broadband nonlinear backscatter in passive devices. The proposed method does not need any relative motion between a reader and a tag or the use of reference anchor nodes. In the conventional radio frequency identification (RFID) system, a passive tag responds to a reader by switching its antenna "on" and "off". The operation of such conventional backscatter is essentially "linear", since the reader-to-tag (downlink) and tag-to-reader (uplink) signals overlap on the same carrier frequency. Although linear backscatter is straightforward, the self-jamming problem caused by strong leakage signals from the transmitter to the receiver is notorious and poses many constraints on the received signal quality, operation bandwidth, modulation flexibility and system complexity. To enable high-accuracy real-time 3D indoor localization for passive devices, we show that nonlinear backscatter is more effective than linear backscatter. Nonlinear backscatter exploits nonlinear elements in passive devices to generate second or higher-order harmonics as the uplink response. Separation of downlink and uplink on different carriers allows immediate self-jamming cancellation and direct un-modulated carrier phase decoding, hence resulting in better received signal quality and broad bandwidth of operation, both of which are critical for the localization system. The broad bandwidth allows the design of an efficient phase-based ranging algorithm - heuristic multi-frequency continuous wave (HMFCW) ranging which resolves ambiguous phase cycles with heuristically optimized sparse carrier frequencies. HMFCW ranging can correctly pin down the phase cycle integer with 100% reliability as long as the phase error falls within ±90° × BW% (percentage bandwidth). In our present implementation, we achieved a median ranging error below 1 cm under phase error bounds of ±50°. We realized real-time 3D localization from differential ranging by nonlinear conjugate gradient (CG) search for hyperboloids intersection in a multi-static transceiving system with 1 Tx antenna and 4 Rx antennas. The measured 3D localization median error was 3.5 cm in the indoor environment. Presently, the measurement latency was less than 0.155 seconds. We will present system design, algorithms and a prototype with experimental evaluation.},

We use all radio available interfaces (e.g. WiFi, LTE) in multi-RAT enabled devices to schedule appropriate components of the application to run either on the mobile device or on the resource-rich cloud, while staying adaptive to the conditions of the wireless network.},

However, current VLC designs commonly require LED lights to emit perceptible light beams, which greatly limits the applicable scenarios of VLC (e.g., in a sunny day when indoor lighting is not needed), and brings high energy overhead and unpleasant visual experiences for mobile devices to transmit data using VLC. We design and develop DarkLight, a new VLC primitive that allows light-based communication to be sustained even when LEDs emit extremely-low luminance. The key idea is to encode data into ultra-short, imperceptible light pulses. We tackle challenges in circuit designs, data encoding/decoding schemes, and DarkLight networking, to efficiently generate and reliably detect ultra-short light pulses using off-the-shelf, low-cost LEDs and photodiodes. Our DarkLight prototype supports 1.3-m distance with 1.6-Kbps data rate. By loosening up VLC's reliance on visible light beams, DarkLight presents an unconventional direction of VLC and fundamentally broadens VLC's application scenarios.},

Existing location forecasting techniques are driven by large volumes of data to train the prediction models in a centralised server. This amounts to considerably long waiting times before the model kicks in. Disclosing highly sensitive location information to third party entities also exposes the user to several privacy risks. To address these issues, we put forth a mobility prediction system, able to provide swift realtime predictions, evading the strenuous training procedure. We enable this by constantly adapting the model to substantive user mobility behaviours that facilitate accurate predictions even on marginal time bounded movements. In comparison to existing frameworks, we utilise less volumes of data to produce satisfactory prediction accuracies. This in turn lowers the computational complexity making implementation on mobile devices feasible and a step towards privacy preservation. Here, only the predicted location can be sent to such services to maintain the utility/privacy tradeoff. Our preliminary evaluations based on real world mobility traces corroborate our hypothesis.},

However, cellphone tower coverage is not uniform and is affected by electromagnetic shadows cast by large structures, multipath, and absorption by various surfaces. Users with high data needs suffer in such locations due to insufficient network bandwidth. A similar insufficiency can also be felt by flash crowds in locations with otherwise moderate signal strength due to division of the available bandwidth. We explore the possibility of using drones as a solution to this problem. The drones can hover with direct line of sight with a cellphone tower and extend cellular coverage into the weaker regions. Our idea is to use the knowledge of large structures in the area to compute the expected SNR space around the client's current location. We use ray-tracing techniques to compute the expected SNR in an area. We then verify its similarity with ground truth by measuring, at several locations on the ground, the received signal strength from a Wifi router on a drone.},

 abstract = {In this work, we explore the potential and impact of unlicensed LTE on WiFi in unlicensed spectrum. Our experiments demonstrate that the large asymmetry in the channel access methodologies employed by WiFi and LTE (carrier sensing/notification in WiFi, energy sensing alone in LTE-U), can result LTE-U completely blocking WiFi transmissions, and causing significant degradation to either technologies from collisions. We address this critical sensing asymmetry with Ultron, a LTE-WiFi co-existence solution that integrates WiFi's carrier sensing and notification mechanisms into LTE, without any modifications to the LTE PHY standard. Ultron operates at the LTE base station and consists of two key components: (a) WiFi embedding that embeds appropriate data into the LTE-subframes through an intelligent reverse-engineering of the LTE PHY, so as to realize a WiFi PLCP preamble-header transmission over the air directly using the LTE PHY; and (b) scalable WiFi sensing that employs a single WiFi interface and maximizes its carrier sensing benefits to all the unlicensed channels operating at the LTE node. Our evaluations demonstrate that Ultron can increase the WiFi and LTE throughput by 5x and 6x respectively, resulting from a sharp reduction in LTE-WiFi interference.},

 abstract = {Cities have benefited from the three greatest technological innovations of the past 200 years: the steam engine, electrification, and the automobile. But each advance has created its own challenges, including pollution, overcrowding, sprawl. As the digital revolution transforms cities once again, how can we make sure it improves quality of life while minimizing the downside? With population density comes the possibility of deploying network connectivity and wayfinding at lower cost, but density also increases complexity of deployment. How can digital technology reduce the bad friction of urban environments, such as congestion, cost, and complexity, while increasing good friction, such as all of the serendipitous interactions that cities encourage? Underlying all this change is ubiquitous connectivity and mobile technology, from the phones people carry with them to the supporting devices and network endpoints embedded in the urban infrastructure. Sidewalk Labs is an Alphabet company that works with cities to develop new technology that can improve urban life. We will discuss some of our discoveries and beliefs, and talk about our plans to use mobile technology to help cities take full advantage of the digital revolution.},

 abstract = {Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) is proposed in 802.11ac to achieve more than 3x faster than 802.11n. In the real world no-one gets close to theoretical speeds. The primary reason for this anomaly are the various overheads of channel access and channel state information (CSI) feedback. In order to achieve concurrent data transmission, (CSI) feedback from users is required. However, this overhead can easily overwhelm the actual channel time spent on data transmission in large-scale network. Moreover, due to spontaneous uplink traffic, which makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a smart CSI feedback protocol called Gabriel. Firstly, Gabriel achieves alterable CSI feedback by evaluating its validity period to eliminate the unnecessary CSI feedback operation. Secondly, we introduce a new concept named 'large time slice' to solve fairness problem. Software-radio based implementation and testbed experimentation show that Gabriel significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CSI feedback reduction methods under various traffic patterns and node mobility.},

Examples include cognitive apps (e.g., speech recognition, natural language translation, as well as face, object, or gesture detection and recognition) and anticipatory apps that proactively track and provide services when needed. Unfortunately, today's mobile devices cannot keep pace with such apps, despite advances in hardware capability. Traditional approaches address this problem by computation offloading. One approach offloads by sending sensed streams to remote cloud servers via cellular networks or to cloudlets via Wi-Fi, where a clone of the app runs [2, 3, 4]. However, cloudlets may not be widely deployed and access to cloud infrastructure may yield high network delays and can be intermittent due to mobility. Morever, users might hesitate to upload private sensing data to the cloud or cloudlet. A second approach offloads to accelerators by rewriting code to use DSP or GPU within mobile devices. However, using accelerators requires substantial programming effort and produces varied benefits for diverse codes on heterogeneous devices.},

In this work, we present an RFID-based solution, Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. Making sense of micro and high-frequency vibration using random and low-frequency readings of tag has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving sub-millisecond period accuracy. Our system achieves these three goals by discerning the change pattern of backscatter signal replied from the tag, which is attached on the vibrating surface and displaced by the vibration within a small range. This work introduces three main innovations. First, it shows how one can utilize COTS RFID to sense mechanical vibration and accurately discover its period with a few periods of short and noisy samples. Second, a new digital microscope is designed to amplify the micro-vibration-induced weak signals. Third, Tagbeat introduces compressive reading to inspect high-frequency vibration with relatively low RFID read rate. We implement Tagbeat using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that Tagbeat can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03%. We also study three cases to demonstrate how to associate our inspection solution with the specific domain requirements.},

Our Dolphin prototype, built using off-the-shelf smartphones, realizes real-time hidden communication, supports up to 8-meter signal capture distance and ±90° listening angle and achieves decoding rate above 80% without error correction.

The massive bandwidth, highly directional antennas, high penetration loss and susceptibility to shadowing in these bands suggest certain advantages to spectrum and infrastructure sharing. In particular, resources that are "open", such as unlicensed spectrum or a deployment of base stations open to all service providers, may offer greater gains in mmWave bands than at conventional cellular frequencies. However, even when sharing is technically beneficial (as recent research in this area suggests that it is), it may not be profitable. In this paper, both the technical and economic implications of resource sharing in millimeter wave networks are studied. Millimeter wave service is considered in the economic framework of a network good, and detailed network simulations are used to understand data rates, profit, and demand for millimeter wave service, with and without open resources. The results suggest that "open" deployments of neutral small cells that serve subscribers of any service provider encourage market entry by making it easier for networks to reach critical mass, more than "open" (unlicensed) spectrum would.},

These, often will transmit short sporadic messages, which are not well suited to the connection-oriented modes associated with legacy 3GPP network resulting in high service latency and excessive control overhead. It is acknowledged that current 4G network could be overwhelmed by the surge in both traffic and control plane signaling load. For 5G, it is necessary to redesign the mobile network to provide a low delay, low control overhead IoT mode that will work efficiently for emerging application scenarios. The MAC layer has to be designed in such a way that IoT messages experience low access latency across both the radio access network and core network. The goal is to operate in the same band as current LTE, thus not requiring any separate bandwidth allocation and is backward compatible with the current 4G system.

 abstract = {Cellular operators want to be able to deploy small cells with the same ease as WiFi access points, to quickly address traffic hotspots in dense urban areas. However, deploying small cells has not been easy. The reason is that due to scarcity of licensed spectrum, small cells need to use the same spectrum as the existing macro cells, and they need to explicitly coordinate their spectrum usage with each other to manage interference. The challenge is that this coordination needs to happen with latencies less than a millisecond, otherwise adding small cells does not help scale the overall network capacity. Implementing such tight coordination in dense urban deployments has not been easy in practice. We present QuickC, a wireless transport technology that can simplify small cell deployment. QuickC enables small cells to coordinate with their neighboring macro and small cells with sub-1ms latencies over the operator's licensed spectrum but in a way that the users of this spectrum are negligibly affected. QuickC is designed to be an "add on" to existing cellular networks and does not require any invasive changes to the existing infrastructure or standards. We implement QuickC on a commodity system on chip from Texas Instruments used for building commercial cellular baseband and show that it can consistently deliver latencies less than 0.6 ms between neighboring cells. We also use system-level simulations to evaluate the wide-area impact of deploying QuickC in current networks, and show that it can deliver 5--10 Mbps of bandwidth between neighboring cells while causing less than 1--4% throughput degradation to the existing users of the spectrum.},

 abstract = {The Location Service (LCS) proposed by the telecommunication industry is an architecture that allows the location of mobile devices to be accessed in various applications. We explore the use of LCS in location-enhanced server authentication, which traditionally relies on certificates. Given recent incidents involving certificate authorities, various techniques to strengthen server authentication were proposed. They focus on improving the certificate validation process, such as pinning, revocation, or multi-path probing. In this paper, we propose using the server's geographic location as a second factor of its authenticity. Our solution, SALVE, achieves location-based server authentication by using secure DNS resolution and by leveraging LCS for location measurements. We develop a TLS extension that enables the client to verify the server's location in addition to its certificate. Successful server authentication therefore requires a valid certificate and the server's presence at a legitimate geographic location, e.g., on the premises of a data center. SALVE prevents server impersonation by remote adversaries with mis-issued certificates or stolen private keys of the legitimate server. We develop a prototype implementation and our evaluation in real-world settings shows that it incurs minimal impact to the average server throughput. Our solution is backward compatible and can be integrated with existing approaches for improving server authentication in TLS.},

WiART collects real-time radio and network statistics from participating network devices and depicts them on users' mobile devices in an intuitive way, leveraging the virtual information overlay of augmented reality. Specifically in our current implementation, WiART takes inputs from a cognitive radio link controlling beam-steerable reconfigurable antennas and annotates on a live mobile screen the active pre-measured radiation patterns. In the reverse flow, WiART enables users to select desired antenna radiation patterns directly in the mobile app and observe their effects on link performance in real time.

In the passive sensing, the received vibration signals are determined by the location of the touch impact. This allows location discrimination of touches precise enough to enable emerging applications such as virtual keyboards on ubiquitous surfaces for mobile devices. Moreover, in the active mode, the received vibration signals carry richer information of the touching object's characteristics (e.g., weight, size, location and material). This further enables our work to match the signals to the trained profiles and allows it to differentiate personal objects in contact with any surface. We evaluated extensively in the use cases of localizing touches (i.e., virtual keyboards), object localization and identification.

 abstract = {Device-free localization of people and objects indoors not equipped with radios is playing a critical role in many emerging applications. This paper presents an accurate model-based device-free localization system LiFS, implemented on cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices. Unlike previous COTS device-based work, LiFS is able to localize a target accurately without offline training. The basic idea is simple: channel state information (CSI) is sensitive to a target's location and by modelling the CSI measurements of multiple wireless links as a set of power fading based equations, the target location can be determined. However, due to rich multipath propagation indoors, the received signal strength (RSS) or even the fine-grained CSI can not be easily modelled. We observe that even in a rich multipath environment, not all subcarriers are affected equally by multipath reflections. Our pre-processing scheme tries to identify the subcarriers not affected by multipath. Thus, CSIs on the "clean" subcarriers can be utilized for accurate localization. We design, implement and evaluate LiFS with extensive experiments in three different environments. Without knowing the majority transceivers' locations, LiFS achieves a median accuracy of 0.5 m and 1.1 m in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art systems. Besides single target localization, LiFS is able to differentiate two sparsely-located targets and localize each of them at a high accuracy.},

As a key form of DSA, government is proposing to release more federal spectrum for sharing with commercial wireless users. However, the flourish of federal-commercial sharing hinges upon how the federal privacy is managed. In current DSA proposals, the sensitive exclusion zone (E-Zone) information of federal incumbent users (IUs) needs to be shared with a spectrum access system (SAS) to realize spectrum allocation. However, SAS is not necessarily trust-worthy for holding the sensitive IU E-Zone data, especially considering that FCC allows some industry third parties (e.g., Google) to operate SAS for better efficiency and scalability. Therefore, the current proposals dissatisfy the IUs' privacy requirement. To address the privacy issue, this paper presents an IU-privacy-preserving SAS (IP-SAS) design, which realizes the spectrum allocation process through secure computation over ciphertext based on homomorphic encryption.},

 abstract = {To meet the growing demand for wireless data, it is time to move away from the age-old paradigm of prohibiting interfering nodes from transmissions. Instead, through proactive management of interference among multiple colliding packets, we can design high throughput wireless systems. This is well explored in the Information Theory community and there are also a few implementational efforts that have been recently reported. The existing solutions are nontrivial to use in real systems as they require either tight time/frequency synchronization or exchange of data between transmitters prior to the transmissions. These requirements are hard to meet in practice especially for uplink transmissions. This paper proposes BASIC, a lightweight multi-user uplink transmission strategy that does not require tight synchronization or exchange of samples among nodes, which makes it an attractive alternative compared to its counterparts. BASIC exploits receiver diversity by controlling the data rates of the clients. A novel greedy algorithm is proposed for data rate selection. We implement BASIC on a software-defined radio platform. Our experiments on a real testbed show that BASIC outperforms TDMA by 48% in terms of overall throughput. Our trace-driven simulations show up to 4.8x gain in throughput with similar flow fairness.},

 abstract = {Owing to dense deployment of light fixtures and multipath-free propagation, visible light localization technology holds potential to overcome the reliability issue of radio localization. However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. We present LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency, which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency (> 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. In our experiments, LiTell demonstrates high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and great potential to achieve sub-meter granularity.},
