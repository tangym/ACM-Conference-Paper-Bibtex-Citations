 abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Caché, a system that offers location privacy for certain classes of location-based applications. The core idea in Caché is to periodically pre-fetch potentially useful location-enhanced content well in advance. Applications then retrieve content from a local cache on the mobile device when it is needed. This approach allows an end-user to make use of location-enhanced content while only revealing to third-party content providers a large geographic region rather than a precise location. In this paper, we present an analysis that examines tradeoffs in terms of storage, bandwidth, and freshness of data. We then discuss the design and implementation of an Android service embodying these ideas. Finally, we provide two evaluations of Caché. One measures the performance of our approach with respect to privacy and mobile content availability using real-world mobility traces. The other focuses on our experiences using Caché to enhance user privacy in three open source Android applications.},

 abstract = {The current generation of mobile smartphones are not just devices for voice communication. Instead, they are frequently used as mobile PC replacements that are used to edit documents, browse the web, check email, and play games. However, this functionality comes at the cost of battery lifetimes. Indeed, to maintain the slim form factor required for these phones (which impacts the amount of battery that can be put into the phone), it is quite common for the battery lifetimes of smartphones to be significantly shorter compared to previous generation of "dumber" phones. In modern smartphones, the three main sources of power consumption are, 1) the CPU, 2) the display, and 3) the network interfaces. Games are popular applications which tend to consume a lot of system resources. In this demonstration we aim to show our system [1] for reducing power consumption of the LCD display during game play. The Demonstration will involve Quake 3 Running on an Android powered Mobile phone.},

 abstract = {This paper is motivated by two observations: (1) cellular network operators are actively exploring advertisement delivery as a new means of revenue generation, and (2) cellular basestations perceive intermittent overloads at different times of day. Bringing the two observations together, we design and implement Opal, a novel system for opportunistically aligning advertisement delivery with basestation overload. Such alignment improves the overall perception of network availability for users. To achieve the alignment systematically, Opal builds on an analytical framework for tunable unavailability of network service to users during overload. At the same time, if the network is not overloaded enough during a certain period, Opal schedules enough advertisements to satisfy the advertisement delivery contracts. Opal minimizes the amount of state to be maintained to play advertisements to users uniformly and also maximizes the number of viewers for each advertisement. We implement a prototype of Opal on a Picochip based WiMAX testbed, and demonstrate its efficacy using simulations, analysis and prototype evaluation.},

 abstract = {Clock synchronization is critical for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) due to the need of inter-node coordination and collaborative information processing. Although many message passing protocols can achieve satisfactory clock synchronization accuracy, they incur prohibitively high overhead when the network scales to more than tens of nodes. An alternative approach is to take advantage of the global time reference induced by existing infrastructures including GPS, timekeeping radio stations, or power grid. However, high power consumption and geographic constraints present them from being widely adopted in WSNs. In this paper, we propose ROCS, a new clock synchronization approach exploiting the Radio Data System (RDS) of FM radios. First, we design a new hardware FM receiver that can extract a periodic pulse from FM broadcasts, referred to as RDS clock. We then conduct a large-scale measurement study of RDS clock in our lab for a period of six days and on a vehicle driving through a metropolitan area of over 40 $km^2$. Our results show that RDS clock is highly stable and hence is a viable means to calibrate the clocks of large-scale city-wide sensor networks. To reduce the high power consumption of FM receiver, ROCS intelligently predicts the time error due to drift, and adaptively calibrates the native clock via the RDS clock. We implement ROCS in TinyOS on our hardware FM receiver and a TelosB-compatible WSN platform. Our extensive experiments using a 12-node testbed and our driving measurement traces show that ROCS achieves accurate and precise clock synchronization with low power consumption.},

It is particularly relevant now with the explosion of mostly single-player or turn-based games on mobile phones. The challenges stem from the highly variable performance of cellular networks and the need for scalability (not burdening the cellular infrastructure, nor any server resources that a game developer deploys). We have built a service for matchmaking in mobile games -- assigning players to games such that game settings are satisfied as well as latency requirements for an enjoyable game. This requires solving two problems. First, the service needs to know the cellular network latency between game players. Second, the service needs to quickly group players into viable game sessions. In this paper, we present the design of our service, results from our experiments on predicting cellular latency, and results from efficiently grouping players into games.},

This has made them undesirable for mobile devices because much of the web content is of bright colors. To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and realization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders web pages with power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by the findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with important options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time, and accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a browser engine. According to measurements with OLED smartphones, Chameleon is able to re-duce average system power consumption for web browsing by 41% and is able to reduce display power consumption by 64% without introducing any noticeable delay.},

Our large scale evaluation demonstrates that our system is (a) accurate --- with the mean fare error under 1 Singapore dollar (~ 0.76 US$) and the mean duration error under three minutes, and (b) capable of real-time performance, processing thousands to millions of queries per second.

When a mobile device is missing, localization techniques may assist in finding the device. Current techniques, however, hardly provide a complete solution because of inaccurate position estimation, especially in indoor environments. In this paper, we describe a software architecture called FindingMiMo, which tracks and locates a missing mobile device in indoor environments. The system consists of a missing mobile which logs diverse environmental features on a daily basis, and a chaser which traces the trail of the device using the observation log. During daily operation, the mobile device does not perform location estimation; it only observes the ambient features such as radio signals to minimize its operation cost. Instead, the chaser determines where the missing device measured the observations. This research implemented the scheme on Android-based smartphones. Real experiments with carefully designed, missing-and-tracking scenarios show that the participants successfully approached their lost phones within four meters distance, on average.},

We find that channel frequency responses across multiple OFDM subcarriers can be suitably aggregated into a location signature. While these signatures vary over time and environmental mobility, we notice that their core structure preserves certain properties that are amenable to localization. We demonstrate these ideas through a functional system, implemented on off-the-shelf Intel 5300 cards (that are designed to export per-subcarrier information to the driver). We evaluate the system in a busy engineering building, a cafeteria, and the university museum, and demonstrate localization accuracies in the granularity of 1m x 1m boxes, called spots. Results show that our system, PinLoc, is able to localize users to a spot with 90% mean accuracy, while incurring less than 6% false positives. We believe this is an important step forward, compared to the best indoor localization schemes of today.},

 abstract = {While traffic signals are necessary to safely control competing flows of traffic, they inevitably enforce a stop-and-go movement pattern that increases fuel consumption, reduces traffic flow and causes traffic jams. These side effects can be alleviated by providing drivers and their onboard computational devices (e.g., vehicle computer, smartphone) with information about the schedule of the traffic signals ahead. Based on when the signal ahead will turn green, drivers can then adjust speed so as to avoid coming to a complete halt. Such information is called Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA). Alternatively, the onboard computational device may suggest an efficient detour that will save the driver from stops and long waits at red lights ahead. This paper introduces and evaluates SignalGuru, a novel software service that relies solely on a collection of mobile phones to detect and predict the traffic signal schedule, enabling GLOSA and other novel applications. Our SignalGuru leverages windshield-mounted phones to opportunistically detect current traffic signals with their cameras, collaboratively communicate and learn traffic signal schedule patterns, and predict their future schedule. Results from two deployments of SignalGuru, using iPhones in cars in Cambridge (MA, USA) and Singapore, show that traffic signal schedules can be predicted accurately. On average, SignalGuru comes within 0.66s, for pre-timed traffic signals and within 2.45s, for traffic-adaptive traffic signals. Feeding SignalGuru's predicted traffic schedule to our GLOSA application, our vehicle fuel consumption measurements show savings of 20.3%, on average.},

We describe how we overcame the Gamma function's non-linear nature by using adaptive thresholds to apply different Gamma values to images with differing brightness levels. These adaptive thresholds allow us to save significant amounts of power while preserving the image quality. We implemented our solution on a laptop and two Android smartphones. Finally, we present measured analytical results for two different games (Quake III and Planeshift), and user study results (using Quake III and 60 participants) that shows that we can save up to 68% of the display power without significantly affecting the perceived gameplay quality.},

 abstract = {The explosive growth of the mobile application market has made it a significant challenge for the users to find interesting applications in crowded App Stores. To alleviate this problem, existing industry solutions often use the users' application download history and possibly their ratings to recommend applications that might interest them, much like Amazon's book recommendations. However, the user downloading an application is a weak indicator of whether the user likes that application, particularly if the application is free and the user just wants to try it out. Using application ratings, on the other hand, suffers from tedious manual input and potential data sparsity problems. In this paper, we present the AppJoy system that makes personalized application recommendations by analyzing how the user actually uses her installed applications. Based on all participants' application usage records, AppJoy employs an item-based collaborative filtering algorithm for individualized recommendations. We discuss AppJoy's design and implementation, and the evaluation shows that it consumes little resource on the off-the-shelf Google Android phones. AppJoy has been available in the Android Market and used by more than 4600 users. The AppJoy's prediction algorithm provided reasonably accurate usage estimate of the recommended applications after they were installed. We also found AppJoy to be effective as the users interacted with recommended applications longer than other applications.},

Our technique is based on a new ambient sound fingerprint called the Acoustic Background Spectrum (ABS). An ABS serves well as a room fingerprint because it is compact, easily computed, robust to transient sounds, and surprisingly distinctive. As with other fingerprint-based localization techniques, location is determined by measuring the current fingerprint and then choosing the "closest" fingerprint from a database. An experiment involving 33 rooms yielded 69% correct fingerprint matches meaning that, in the majority of observations, the fingerprint was closer to a previous visit's fingerprint than to any fingerprints from the other 32 rooms. An implementation of ABS-localization called Batphone is publicly available for Apple iPhones. We used Batphone to show the benefit of using ABS-localization together with a commercial Wi-Fi-based localization method. In this second experiment, adding ABS improved room-level localization accuracy from 30% (Wi-Fi only) to 69% (Wi-Fi and ABS). While Wi-Fi-based localization has difficulty distinguishing nearby rooms, Batphone performs just as well with nearby rooms; it can distinguish pairs of adjacent rooms with 92% accuracy.},

@inproceedings{Manweiler:2011:ARH:1999995.2000020,
 abstract = {WiFi continues to be a prime source of energy consumption in mobile devices. This paper observes that, despite a rich body of research in WiFi energy management, there is room for improvement. Our key finding is that WiFi energy optimizations have conventionally been designed with a single AP in mind. However, network contention among different APs can dramatically increase a client's energy consumption. Each client may have to keep awake for long durations before its own AP gets a chance to send packets to it. As the AP density increases in the vicinity, the waiting time inflates, resulting in a proportional decrease in battery life. We design SleepWell, a system that achieves energy efficiency by evading network contention. The APs regulate the sleeping window of their clients in a way that different APs are active/inactive during non-overlapping time windows. The solution is analogous to the common wisdom of going late to office and coming back late, thereby avoiding the rush hours. We implement SleepWell on a testbed of 8 Laptops and 9 Android phones, and evaluate it over a wide variety of scenarios and traffic patterns (YouTube, Pandora, FTP, Internet radio, and mixed). Results show a median gain of up to 2x when WiFi links are strong; when links are weak and the network density is high, the gains can be even more. We believe SleepWell is a desirable upgrade to WiFi systems, especially in light of increasing WiFi density.},

 abstract = {In wireless LANs, partial packets are often received which usually contain only a few errors. According to the current 802.11 standard, such packets have to be retransmitted. Much effort has been invested recently in repairing such packets without retransmitting the entire packet, e.g., by using error correction (EC) code or retransmitting only the corrupted blocks. In this paper, we revisit this problem, and propose Unite, a framework for more efficient partial packet recovery. Unite is motivated by two key observations. First, the two repair methods, i.e., the EC-based and block-based, are not mutually exclusive and can be combined to achieve higher performance. Second, the recently introduced error estimators can be utilized to determine the optimal repair method depending on the condition of each partial packet. The combined method should achieve better performance than each individual method; in addition, it should remain low in complexity because the EC-based and block-based method are both simple in nature. Unite uses AMPS, a recently proposed estimator, for error estimation. We implement Unite on the Madwifi open source driver, and our experiments show that Unite outperforms other recovery schemes.},

 abstract = {System energy models are important for energy optimization and management in mobile systems. However, existing system energy models are built in a lab setting with the help from a second computer. Not only are they labor-intensive; but also they do not adequately account for the great diversity in the hardware and usage of mobile systems. Moreover, existing system energy models are intended for energy estimation for time intervals of one second or longer; they do not provide the required rate for fine-grain use such as per-application energy accounting. In this work, we study a self-modeling paradigm in which a mobile system automatically generates its energy model without any external assistance. Our solution, Sesame, leverages the possibility of self power measurement through the smart battery interface and employs a suite of novel techniques to achieve accuracy and rate much higher than that of the smart battery interface. We report the implementation and evaluation of Sesame on a laptop and a smartphone. The experiment results show that Sesame is able to generate system energy models of 95% accuracy at one estimation per second and of 88% accuracy at one estimation per 10ms, without any external assistance. Two five-day field studies with four laptop and four smartphone users further demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and non-invasiveness of Sesame.},

In this work we describe our experimental investigation into the energy consumption impact of compact UHF Class-1 Generation-2 RFID readers as compared with existing sensors that are common in smartphones. Our evaluation shows that the energy consumption of compact RFID readers is affected by environmental conditions and network parameters that influence reader-tag link quality and that reader energy consumption is comparable to existing integrated Bluetooth, GPS and WiFi interfaces on smartphones. Existing experimental work on UHF readers (e.g., [1]) has focused mainly on tag read performance while our goal is to characterize how various factors impact the energy consumption of compact readers relative to existing smartphone sensors.},

This paper studies the security versus energy tradeoffs for a particularly challenging class of malware detectors, namely rootkit detectors. We investigate the security versus energy tradeoffs along two axes: attack surface and malware scanning frequency, for both code and data based rootkit detectors. Our findings, based on a real implementation on a mobile handheld device, reveal that protecting against code-driven attacks is relatively cheap, while protecting against all data-driven attacks is prohibitively expensive. Based on our findings, we determine a sweet spot in the security versus energy tradeoff, called the balanced profile, which protects a mobile device against a vast majority of known attacks, while consuming a limited amount of extra battery power.},

 abstract = {While traffic signals allow competing flows of traffic to safely cross busy intersections, they inevitably enforce a stop-and-go movement pattern. This stop-and-go movement pattern increases fuel consumption by 17%, CO2 emissions by 15%, and reduces vehicle flow aggravating congestion and driver frustration. The stop-and-go movement pattern can be alleviated by utilizing information about the future schedule of the traffic signals ahead. Based on when the signal ahead will turn green, onboard computational devices (e.g., smartphones) can advice the drivers on the optimal speed they should maintain so that they can cruise through an intersection and avoid coming to complete halt. Alternatively, efficient detours may be suggested to the drivers to avoid waiting for a long time at a red light. Our MobiSys'11 paper proposes SignalGuru, a novel software service that relies solely on collaborating windshield-mounted mobile phones to provide information about the schedule of traffic signals and enable a set of novel driver-assistance applications. The SignalGuru service consists of four main modules: First, video frames are captured with the mobile phone cameras and processed to detect the color (status) transitions (e.g., RED to GREEN) of the traffic signal ahead (detection module). Then, information across multiple consecutive frames is used to filter away erroneous traffic signal transition detections (transition filtering module). Third, SignalGuru-enabled phones collaborate by sharing their databases of detected traffic signal transitions with other phones within communication range (collaboration module). Finally, the merged data- base of traffic signal transitions is fed into a customized machine learning-based model to predict the future schedule of the traffic signal ahead (prediction module). Our demo will present a SignalGuru system, in which two SignalGuru-enabled iPhone 4 devices (iPhones A and B) will be collaborating to predict the schedule of the two pairs of mock traffic signals of the two intersecting roads of an intersection. The pictures of the intersection (taken with actual windshield-mounted iPhone devices) will be printed on posterboards A and B. The camera of SignalGuru-enabled iPhone A will be looking at posterboard A and the camera of SignalGuru-enabled iPhone B at posterboard B. While the iPhone B device will be fixed, the iPhone A device will be mounted on a lego vehicle so that it can move closer to or farther away from posterboard A. The mock traffic signals will be implemented with electronic displays (iPhone/iPad screen) and will be switching to red/green/ yellow based on a defined schedule. For the demo, we will be be bringing all the required electronic equipment and the two posterboards. However, we will also need two holders for the posterboards and two small tables for Signal-Guru-enabled devices A and B to stand. Demo attendants will be able to test the real time operation of SignalGuru and interact with it. More specifically, demo attendants will be able to see how the detection window gets dynamically adapted as they change the device's orientation and/or its distance from the traffic signal, and how SignalGuru's detection and filtering modules react to real-world events like fully or partially occluded traffic signals and false positive/negative signal detections. We believe that our SignalGuru demo will complement nicely our paper presentation as it will offer a good opportunity to discuss with conference participants about our system, demonstrate to them the challenges that our system poses as well as how it tackles them.},

 abstract = {Emergent location-aware applications often require tracking trajectories of mobile devices over a long period of time. To be useful, the tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact on the battery life of the mobile device. Furthermore, when trajectory information needs to be sent to a remote server, on-device simplification of the trajectories is needed to reduce the amount of data transmission. While there has recently been a lot of work on energy-efficient position tracking, the energy-efficient tracking of trajectories has not been addressed in previous work. In this paper we propose a novel on-device sensor management strategy and a set of trajectory updating protocols which intelligently determine when to sample different sensors (accelerometer, compass and GPS) and when data should be simplified and sent to a remote server. The system is configurable with regards to accuracy requirements and provides a unified framework for both position and trajectory tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by emulation experiments on real world data sets collected from different modes of transportation (walking, running, biking and commuting by car) as well as by validating with a real-world deployment. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to provide considerable savings in the battery consumption compared to a state-of-the-art position tracking system while at the same time maintaining the accuracy of the resulting trajectory, i.e., support of specific accuracy requirements and different types of applications can be ensured.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the MobiSys 2012: The Tenth International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services. This year's conference continues the MobiSys tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research in mobile and wireless systems. The call for papers attracted 182 submissions. This was a new record for MobiSys and a strong sign that of the vibrancy of our community. Each paper was assigned to two Program Committee members for a first round of reviews. Each of the 155 papers with at least one review of "weak reject" was assigned an additional reviewer from the Program Committee in the second round. In the final round, we assigned an additional pair of reviewers or more to each of the top 88 papers. In all the Program Committee members and external reviewers generated 724 reviews and the top 88 papers received at least 5 reviews. The Program Committee met for a full day at La Jolla, CA. The Committee discussed the top 60 papers and accepted 32 papers for the program. The 32 paper count is another record high for MobiSys and shows that there is a great deal of high quality work coming from our community. Each of these 32 papers was shepherded by a member of the Program Committee to help ensure that recommendations made by the reviewers and during the Program Committee meeting were addressed. There were several new additions to the review process. First, we created an External Review Panel composed of people active in the mobile computing industry. In addition to getting the valuable opinions of these experts, a secondary goal of the panel was to increase the interaction between these industry leaders and the MobiSys community. Second, we had the Program Committee generate a single public review for each accepted paper. The public review highlights the key contributions of the paper that convinced the Program Committee to accept the paper and some of the remaining weaknesses in the paper. These public reviews were posted on an online forum (http://reviews.mobisys2012.rice.edu/) to help promote community discussion on each paper.},

Notably, there is an increasing emphasis on smartphones, which reflects their growing momentum as powerful, programmable mobile systems. Continuing the tradition of past conferences, this year's conference is preceded by a day of workshops and a PhD forum. Prof. Rosalind W. Picard and Prof. Deborah Estrin are delivering the keynote speeches this year, discussing their research in affective computing and participatory sensing. The demonstration and poster chair, Romit Roy Choudhary, has put together an exciting session that exhibits the best of the current work in our field. MobiSys'10 received 126 submissions, which is roughly the same as the last three years. The papers were reviewed in two rounds. Each paper received at least three reviews during the first round. Based on these reviews, 86 papers were selected to be reviewed in the second round, with each paper receiving up to two additional reviews. All papers discussed at the PC meeting received at least five reviews, almost all of them from PC members. In addition, every review was read and vetted for quality by the PC chairs. All told, our diligent reviewers produced 527 reviews. We discussed 59 papers at an all-day PC meeting, which followed the HotMobile workshop in Annapolis, MD. At the meeting, 25 papers were accepted to appear in the conference program. All accepted papers were shepherded by a PC member.},

 abstract = {Many emerging location-aware applications require position information. However, these applications rarely use celltower-based localization because of its inaccuracy, preferring instead to use the more energy-hungry GPS. In this paper, we present CAPS, a Cell-ID Aided Positioning System. CAPS leverages near-continuous mobility and the position history of a user to achieve significantly better accuracy than the celltower-based approach, while keeping energy overhead low. CAPS is designed based on the insight that users exhibit consistency in routes traveled, and that cell-ID transition points that the user experiences can, on a frequently traveled route, uniquely identify position. To this end, CAPS uses a cell-ID sequence matching technique to estimate current position based on the history of cell-ID and GPS position sequences that match the current cell-ID sequence. We have implemented CAPS on Android-based smartphones and have extensively evaluated it at different locations, and for different platforms and carriers. Our evaluation results show that CAPS can save more than 90% of the energy spent by the positioning system compared to the case where GPS is always used, while providing reasonably accurate position information with errors less than 20% of the celltower-based scheme.},

 abstract = {Mobile devices face a growing demand to support computationally intensive applications like 3D graphics and computer vision. However, these devices are inherently limited by processor power density and device battery life. Dynamic remote execution addresses this problem, by enabling mobile devices to opportunistically offload computations to a remote server. We envision remote execution as a new type of cloud-based heterogeneous computing resource, or a "Cloud-on-Chip", which would be managed as a system resource as if it were a local CPU, with a highly variable wireless interconnect. To realize this vision, we introduce MARS, the first adaptive, online and lightweight RPC-based remote execution scheduler supporting multi-threaded and multi-core systems. MARS uses a novel efficient offloading decision algorithm that takes into account the inherent trade-offs between communication and computation delays and power consumption. Due to its lightweight design, MARS runs on the device itself, instantly adapts its decisions to changing wireless resources, and supports any number of threads and cores. We evaluated MARS using a trace-based simulator driven by real world measurements on augmented reality, face recognition and video game applications. MARS achieves an average speedup of 57% and 33% higher energy savings over the best static client-server partitions.},

The provisioning of increasing demand in capacity and higher quality of service can be met with redimensioning of networks which makes a priori network planning difficult. We propose a network performance monitoring system to which all mobile devices contribute by voluntarily submitting periodical reports on the availability and quality of network access that they experience at their current geographical locations. Network performance measures such as signal strength, coverage, call block/drop statistics and operator service capabilities are reported to a server with a network status information database as experienced by mobile devices. The proposed database will indicate areas with lack of coverage, insufficient capacity, and high interference, which may serve as cues for operators to upgrade/retune their infrastructure equipment and for regulators to take action against operators that do not fulfill commitments made to their subscribers.},

 abstract = {Forming secure associations between wireless devices that do not share a prior trust relationship is an important problem. This paper presents ProxiMate, a system that allows wireless devices in proximity to securely pair with one another autonomously by generating a common cryptographic key directly from their shared time-varying wireless environment. The shared key synthesized by ProxiMate can be used by the devices to authenticate each others' physical proximity and then to communicate confidentially. Unlike traditional pairing approaches such as Diffie-Hellman, ProxiMate is secure against a computationally unbounded adversary and its computational complexity is linear in the size of the key. We evaluate ProxiMate using an experimental prototype built using an open-source software-defined platform and demonstrate its effectiveness in generating common secret bits. We further show that it is possible to speed up secret key synthesis by monitoring multiple RF sources simultaneously or by shaking together the devices that need to be paired. Finally, we show that ProxiMate is resistant to even the most powerful attacker who controls the public RF source used by the legitimate devices for pairing.},

 abstract = {Operators of 3G data networks need to distinguish the performance of each geographic area in their 3G networks to detect and resolve local network problems. This is because the quality of the "last mile" radio link between 3G base stations and end-user devices is a crucial factor in the end-to-end performance that each user experiences. It is relatively straightforward to measure the performance of all IP traffic in the 3G network from a small number of vantage points in the core network. However, the location information available about each mobile device (e.g., the cell sector/site that it is in) is often too stale to be accurate because of user mobility. Moreover, very costly infrastructure deployment and maintenance of custom equipment would be required to collect fine-grained location information about all mobile devices on an on-going basis in large 3G networks. Thus, it is a challenge to accurately assign IP performance measurements to fine-grained geographic regions of the 3G network using existing standard network components. Fortunately, previous studies have observed that human mobility patterns are very predictable. In this paper, we exploit this predictability to develop a novel clustering algorithm grouping related cell sectors that accurately assigns IP performance measurements to fine-grained geographic regions. We present results from a prototype in a real 3G network that shows our approach provides more accurate performance localization than existing approaches. Eventually, we can either narrow down individual IP performance measurements into only 4 candidate cell sectors consistently with the accuracy of 70% over one week based on a one-day snapshot of fine-grained 3GPP events, or increase the accuracy 20% comparing with site-level accuracy through lightweight handover statistics hourly collected at RNCs. Using our approach, we improve anomaly detection based on IP performance measurements by reducing the number of false positives and false negatives. Our study also sheds light on the mobility patterns of 3G devices.},

Research on energy-efficiency in many guises is also very popular. A broad set of other topics is represented in the program, covering aspects of security, sensor networks and wireless protocols, and mobile applications and services. We received 141 submissions, roughly a 10% increase from the previous year, as MobiSys continues to grow as a venue. The papers were reviewed as in past years, with a two round review process. Each paper received three reviews during the first round. Half of the papers then advanced to the second round, where they received two further reviews. All told, our tireless PC members produced over 560 reviews. To select the program, we discussed 55 papers at an all-day face-to-face PC meeting directly following the HotMobile workshop in Phoenix, AZ. The resulting program that you see before you features 25 highly-competitive papers. All of these papers were further shepherded by a PC member to improve their presentation. As well as papers, we are very fortunate to have an excellent line-up of speakers who capitalize on our "Washington, DC" location: Dr. Edward Felten will speak in his new role as Chief Technologist for the FTC, and Dr. Douglas Sicker will speak in his role as the Chief Technologist for the FCC. And as is a tradition for MobiSys, the recipient of the SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contributor Award will deliver a keynote; this year we keenly look forward to hearing from Prof. Mahadev "Satya" Satyanarayanan. The technical program also includes an eagerly anticipated event, the poster and demonstration session. This year we have 23 demonstrations and 11 posters that highlight new research!

 abstract = {WiFi continues to be a prime source of energy consumption in mobile devices. We observe that, despite a rich body of research in WiFi energy management, there is room for improvement. Our key finding is that WiFi energy optimizations have conventionally been designed with a single AP in mind. However, network contention among different APs can dramatically increase a client's energy consumption. Each client may have to keep awake for long durations before its own AP gets a chance to send packets to it. As the AP density increases in the vicinity, the waiting time inflates, resulting in a proportional decrease in battery life. We present a demonstration of SleepWell, a system to appear in the MobiSys 2011 main conference. SleepWell achieves energy efficiency by evading network contention. APs regulate the sleeping window of their clients in a way that different APs are active/inactive during non-overlapping time windows. The solution is analogous to the common wisdom of going late to office and coming back late, thereby avoiding the rush hours. We believe SleepWell is a desirable upgrade to WiFi systems, especially in light of increasing WiFi density.},

This paper attempts to exploit this convergence towards the problem of automatic image tagging. We envision TagSense, a mobile phone based collaborative system that senses the people, activity, and context in a picture, and merges them carefully to create tags on-the-fly. The main challenge pertains to discriminating phone users that are in the picture from those that are not. We deploy a prototype of TagSense on 8 Android phones, and demonstrate its effectiveness through 200 pictures, taken in various social settings. While research in face recognition continues to improve image tagging, TagSense is an attempt to embrace additional dimensions of sensing towards this end goal. Performance comparison with Apple iPhoto and Google Picasa shows that such an out-of-band approach is valuable, especially with increasing device density and greater sophistication in sensing/learning algorithms.},

 abstract = {As mobile devices evolve, end users have ever increasing demand for ubiquitous network access. WiFi, being now commonplace, has the potential to fulfill this demand. Apart from WiFi hotspots deployed by ISPs, home users start showing interest in sharing bandwidth with others (e.g. Fon bases its business model on users sharing open access points.) However, all existing WiFi sharing approaches are unsecured due to the difficulty of distributing access keys, discouraging potential users. Meanwhile, social networking provides a large scale, well established social graph, which is an attractive candidate for authentication services. Previous work on social networks as authentication mechanisms such as Social WiFi requires users to first register with a third-party server through an open Access Point (AP), which adds an unneeded step to the process, and complicates user management at the third-party. Our Social Network-Enabled EAP method (SNEAP) integrates the authentication services in social networks with the widely-adopted EAP framework. In addition, the extensibility of EAP and our software-based solution allow easy incremental deployment, and our chosen platform offers broad hardware compatibility.},

This paper envisions a system called PhonePoint Pen that uses the in-built accelerometer in mobile phones to recognize human writing. By holding the phone like a pen, a user should be able to write short messages or draw simple diagrams in the air. The acceleration due to hand gestures can be translated into geometric strokes, and recognized as characters. We prototype the PhonePoint Pen on the Nokia N95 platform, and evaluate it through real users. Results show that English characters can be identified with an average accuracy of 91.9%, if the users conform to a few reasonable constraints. Future work is focused on refining the prototype, with the goal of offering a new user-experience that complements keyboards and touch-screens.},

We design and implement ARO, the mobile Application Resource Optimizer, the first tool that efficiently and accurately exposes the cross-layer interaction among various layers including radio resource channel state, transport layer, application layer, and the user interaction layer to enable the discovery of inefficient resource usage for smartphone applications. To realize this, ARO provides three key novel analyses: (i) accurate inference of lower-layer radio resource control states, (ii) quantification of the resource impact of application traffic patterns, and (iii) detection of energy and radio resource bottlenecks by jointly analyzing cross-layer information. We have implemented ARO and demonstrated its benefit on several essential categories of popular Android applications to detect radio resource and energy inefficiencies, such as unacceptably high (46%) energy overhead of periodic audience measurements and inefficient content prefetching behavior.},

 abstract = {Resource constrained mobile devices need to leverage computation on nearby servers to run responsive applications that recognize objects, people, or gestures from real-time video. The two key questions that impact performance are what computation to offload, and how to structure the parallelism across the mobile device and server. To answer these questions, we develop and evaluate three interactive perceptual applications. We find that offloading and parallelism choices should be dynamic, even for a given application, as performance depends on scene complexity as well as environmental factors such as the network and device capabilities. To this end we develop Odessa, a novel, lightweight, runtime that automatically and adaptively makes offloading and parallelism decisions for mobile interactive perception applications. Our evaluation shows that the incremental greedy strategy of Odessa converges to an operating point that is close to an ideal offline partitioning. It provides more than a 3x improvement in application performance over partitioning suggested by domain experts. Odessa works well across a variety of execution environments, and is agile to changes in the network, device and application inputs.},
