 abstract = {The smartphone has become an important part of our daily lives. However, the user experience is still far from being optimal. In particular, despite the rapid hardware upgrades, current smartphones often suffer various unpredictable delays during operation, e.g., when launching an app, leading to poor user experience. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of reads and writes in smartphones. We conduct the first large-scale measurement study on the Android I/O delay using the data collected from our Android application running on 2611 devices within nine months. Among other factors, we observe that reads experience up to 626% slowdown when blocked by concurrent writes for certain workloads. Additionally, we show the asymmetry of the slowdown of one I/O type due to another, and elaborate the speedup of concurrent I/Os over serial ones. We use this obtained knowledge to design and implement a system prototype called SmartIO that reduces the application delay by prioritizing reads over writes, and grouping them based on assigned priorities. SmartIO issues I/Os with optimized concurrency parameters. The system is implemented on the Android platform and evaluated extensively on several groups of popular applications. The results show that our system reduces launch delays by up to 37.8%, and run-time delays by up to 29.6%.},

 abstract = {A mouse has been one of the most successful user interfaces due to its intuitive use. As more devices are equipped with displays and offer rich options for users to choose from, a traditional mouse that requires a surface to operate is no longer sufficient. While different types of air mice are available in the market, they rely on accelerometers and gyroscopes, which significantly limit the accuracy and ease of use. In this paper, we develop a system that can accurately track hand movement to realize a mouse. A unique advantage of our scheme is that it achieves high tracking accuracy using the existing hardware already available in the mobile devices (e.g., smart phones and smart watches) and equipment to be controlled (e.g., smart TVs). More specifically, our approach sends inaudible sound pulses at a few selected frequencies, and uses the frequency shifts to estimate the speed and distance traveled. We then develop techniques to quickly calibrate the distance between speakers and narrow down the device's initial position using its movement trajectory. Based on the information, we continuously track the device's new position in real time. This is feasible because many devices, such as smart TVs, PCs, and laptops, already have multiple speakers. When only one speaker is available, we can leverage the frequency shift of sound along with the phase of received WiFi signal to enable tracking. Our evaluation and user study demonstrate that our system achieves high tracking accuracy (e.g., median error of around 1.4 cm) and ease of use.},

The research themes include wearable computing, privacy and security, gaming, wireless networks, and more. We are delighted to anchor the technical program with keynote talks by Dr. Krishan Sabnani and Dr. Deborah Estrin. Drs. Sabnani and Estrin have been leading researchers in Internet design, wireless networks, and sensing for over twenty years. In addition to the keynotes, we have an exciting technical program that includes 29 full-length technical papers chosen by the technical program committee (TPC). This year, we had a record number of 219 submissions. To reduce the number of reviews each TPC member had to write, we augmented the TPC with an external review committee (ERC) of 30 experts. Most ERC members reviewed seven papers during the initial round of the review process. Our review process consisted of three rounds. In the first round, all submissions received three reviews, each written by a member of the TPC or ERC. If a reviewer recommended that a paper be accepted, the paper advanced to the second round. In the second round, papers received two or more additional reviews. At the end of the second round, reviewers discussed each remaining paper online to determine whether it should advance to the third round of decisions. The third round of decisions occurred during an all-day face-to-face meeting of the TPC. By the conclusion of this meeting, the TPC had identified the 29 papers in the program. Finally, all accepted papers were shepherded by a TPC member to ensure that the final manuscripts met the standards of the committee. We also took strict precautions throughout the review process to avoid conflicts of interest.},

 abstract = {Visible light positioning (VLP) is an emerging positioning technique that utilizes indoor light sources to broadcast archer locations through visible light communication (VLC). Benefited by the densely deployed light lamps, VLP holds the promise for more accurate positioning accuracy than RF based approaches, and thus enables interesting applications such as retail navigation and shelf-level advertising in supermarkets and shopping malls. However, we observe that in existing VLP systems, receiving devices are heavily burdened in handling light flickering for VLC. In order to prevent human from being disturbed, the VLC transmitter lamps have to transmit pulses in a high rate (over 1kHz). Since the pulse rate far exceeds the cameras' sampling capability (30fps), receiver design either requires customized light sensor with cumbersome calibration on receiving signal strength [2] or processing high resolution images to leverage rolling shutter effect of the CMOS camera to decode message [1]. The heavy burden on receiving devices motivated us to try getting rid of light flickers. Since human eyes normally can not perceive changes in polarization, the idea is to modulate polarization instead of intensity for communication. In this demo, we demonstrate the VLC system in our VLP design [3] which realizes this idea. It enables lightweight VLC that is even affordable in wearables (Google Glass), without incurring hardware modification or computation off-loading. Moreover, it also makes other types of illuminating light beyond LED light (even sun light) possible to construct communication, therefore eliminates the barrier for deploying future VLC-based applications. As detailed in the full paper [3], our design was inspired by the liquid crystal display (LCD), from which we borrowed polarizer and liquid crystal. Liquid crystal has the property to change the polarization of bypassing polarized light according to the applied voltage. We use polarizer to polarize illuminating light and leverage liquid crystal to modulate bits through changing the light's polarization. The receiver can thus detect changes in polarization with a polarizing film, through which different polarizations result in different intensities. Since the SNR of such communication channel may significantly vary with the mobility of receiving device, we propose to add a dispersion filter to the transmitter. The dispersion filter can cast different frequency of lights into different polarization directions so that SNR in different receiving directions are evened. With the above techniques, VLC transmitter generates signal in low baud rate and mobile devices can perform VLC through camera directly. The communication is long in distance and lightweight enough for resource-constrained devices since the information is carried in intensity changes rather than certain image patterns in rolling shutter approaches. In this demo, we will illustrate the prototype implementation of the VLC communication system. We use incandescent lamps as illuminating light sources. The transmitter consists of a polarizing film, a liquid crystal layer, a dispersor and a control board. The receiver is demonstrated in Android smartphone with polarizing film in front of the camera.},

 abstract = {Advertising is the primary source of revenue for many mobile apps. One important goal of the ad delivery process is targeting users, based on criteria like users' geolocation, context, demographics, long-term behavior, etc. In this paper we report an in-depth study that broadly characterizes what targeting information mobile apps send to ad networks and how effectively, if at all, ad networks utilize the information for targeting users. Our study is based on a novel tool, called MadScope, that can (1) quickly harvest ads from a large collection of apps, (2) systematically probe an ad network to characterize its targeting mechanism, and (3) emulate user profiles of specific preferences and interests to study behavioral targeting. Our analysis of 500K ad requests from 150K Android apps and 101 ad networks indicates that apps do not yet exploit the full potential of targeting: even though ad controls provide APIs to send a lot of information to ad networks, much key targeting information is optional and is often not provided by app developers. We also use MadScope to systematically probe top 10 in-app ad networks to harvest over 1 million ads and find that while targeting is used by many of the top networks, there remain many instances where targeting information or behavioral profile does not have a statistically significant impact on how ads are chosen. We also contrast our findings with a recent study of targeted in-browser ads.},

Conducting network measurements can give us insight into user-perceived network conditions, but doing so requires careful consideration of device state and efficient use of scarce resources. Existing approaches address these concerns in ad-hoc ways. In this work we propose Mobilyzer, a platform for conducting mobile network measurement experiments in a principled manner. Our system is designed around three key principles: network measurements from mobile devices require tightly controlled access to the network interface to provide isolation; these measurements can be performed efficiently using a global view of available device resources and experiments; and distributing the platform as a library to existing apps provides the incentives and low barrier to adoption necessary for large-scale deployments. We describe our current design and implementation, and illustrate how it provides measurement isolation for applications, efficiently manages measurement experiments and enables a new class of experiments for the mobile environment.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) will connect not only Zigbee-enabled devices but also Wi-Fi-enabled consumer electronics, given the recent rise of IPv6. We developed a power saving communication protocol for low-complexity IPv6-connected devices that can support multiple applications. We demonstrate here in an entertainment-related application scenario how to use that protocol to bring what we refer to as the Internet of Toys to life (Fig. 1). We demonstrate a real-time Internet of Toys system using the Multi-Hop Power Saving Mode (MH-PSM) protocol developed for Wi-Fi enabled IPv6-connected devices on the Contiki OS embedded open source platform [1]. MH-PSM enables low-latency ad hoc communication using 802.11 over multiple hops [2]. The software system includes the RRPL dynamic routing [3] and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The hardware platform is based on low-complexity Arduino Due boards. The system setup includes a gateway, which is an Internet-connected laptop running a CoAP border-router. The toys and gateway create an 802.11 IBSS (ad hoc) network using IPv6. We have implemented an application that enables toys to speak together in coordination (i.e., to engage in a dialog according to a scripted story). The coordination requires signaling between toys. The gateway runs a web server allowing some features of the application to be controlled by a web browser on a phone. The web application creates signaling traffic between the phone and toy(s) which traverses the gateway. The toys can also be monitored and controlled remotely from anywhere in the Internet using CoAP. Fig. 2 shows experimental results when ten toys are active simultaneously transmitting one packet per second to all the other nodes. Such a setup creates a congested environment, with the topology including up to five-hop routes. Comparing the demo setup with an earlier testbed that used MH-PSM [2] with static routes, we note an increase of the delay due to the routing overhead of RRPL. For similar reasons, the packet delivery ratio is also on average 5% lower in the real-time system compared to an earlier evaluation in a testbed. The real-time application clearly introduces new challenges that must be addressed compared to an evaluation in a testbed with predetermined routing tables. However, this application scenario can handle the extra work and the real-time system demonstrates that MH-PSM with RRPL and CoAP can efficiently support a wide range of IoT applications, with packet delivery ratio over 90%. Currently, we are working on moving this platform to support more powerful OpenWrt-enabled devices. In our demonstration, participants can experience the Internet of Toys and use an iPhone (provided) to select a story for the toys to narrate.},

The detection algorithm does not require the user to wear any active devices nor does it require a change in the user's wireless transmission technique. The receiver system is implemented with five antennas. We cancel the signals received on multiple antennas. The key insight to realizing a fine-grained localization system is to exploit the extremely high sensitivity of cancellation performance (interference cancellation in full-duplex for example) to exact amplitude and phase matching. The receiver design introduces a delay mismatch between the received signal streams to guarantee imperfect cancellation across the transmission bandwidth except at one in-band frequency resulting in a trough in the cancellation spectrum. We detect keystrokes by forming an array of observed trough frequency across different antenna pairs. We implement our receiver system on the NI-based SDR platform. With full-training the receiver detects a keystroke within one key offset with an accuracy of 91.8%. With a short ≈ 10 character training input, this accuracy drops to 85%.},

This paper asks: What does it take to enable augmented reality (AR) on smartphones today? To build a ready-to-use mobile AR system, we adopt a top-down approach cutting across smartphone sensing, computer vision, cloud offloading, and linear optimization. Our core contribution is in a novel location-free geometric representation of the environment - from smartphone sensors - and using this geometry to prune down the visual search space. Metrics of success include both accuracy and latency of object identification, coupled with the ease of use and scalability in uncontrolled environments. Our converged system, OverLay, is currently deployed in the engineering building and open for use to regular public; ongoing work is focussed on campus-wide deployment to serve as a "historical tour guide" of UIUC.

Topics include automated user-interface exploration, efficient resource usage, gesture recognition, localization, privacy and security, wearable computing, wireless networks, and more. We are thrilled to begin the technical program with a keynote talk by Professor James Landay of Cornell NYC Tech. Dr. Landay has been a leading researcher on human-computer interaction and ubiquitous computing for over twenty years. After the keynote, we have an exciting technical program that includes 25 full-length technical papers chosen by the technical program committee (TPC) from 185 submissions. As interest in the conference has grown over the last several years, so too has the review load for MobiSys TPCs. To reduce the number of reviews each TPC member had to write, we augmented the TPC with an external review committee (ERC) of experts. Most ERC members reviewed six papers during the initial round of the review process. Our review process consisted of three rounds of decisions. During the first round, all submissions received three or four reviews, each written by a member of the TPC or ERC. If a reviewer recommended that a paper be accepted, the paper advanced to the second round. During the second round, papers received three or four additional reviews, almost entirely from the TPC. At the end of the second round, reviewers discussed each remaining paper online to determine whether it should advance to the third round of decisions. The third round of decisions occurred during an all-day face-to-face meeting of the TPC. By the conclusion of this meeting, the TPC had identified the 25 papers in the program. Finally, all accepted papers were shepherded by a TPC member to ensure that the final manuscripts met the standards of the committee. We took strict precautions throughout the review process to avoid conflicts of interest. Furthermore, as the TPC chairs, we did not submit papers to avoid conflicts of interest.},

 abstract = {This work presents the bPart, a highly integrated autonomous sensor platform for use with mobile phones and devices. It consists of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio and several MEMS sensors, all integrated in a volume of less than 1cm³, including the battery. Aside from the wireless transceiver, the bPart features sensors for ambient illumination, 3D-acceleration, temperature and relative humidity. In addition, there is a button and a magnetic switch for binary input and a RGB-LED for user feedback. A secondary LED in the infrared spectrum enables camera-assisted identification and tracking of the node. Runtimes of several years are possible on the included CR2023 lithium coin cell, through the low energy radio, onboard power-conversion and low-power sleep modes. The latter is rated below 2µW and a single data packet consumes about 75µWs. Its low energy consumption makes the bPart suitable for operation with energy harvesting, which we have validated with a 33cm² solar cell in indoor lighting conditions.},

 abstract = {This paper develops techniques using which humans can be visually recognized. While face recognition would be one approach to this problem, we believe that it may not be always possible to see a person?s face. Our technique is complementary to face recognition, and exploits the intuition that human motion patterns and clothing colors can together encode several bits of information. Treating this information as a "temporary fingerprint", it may be feasible to recognize an individual with reasonable consistency, while allowing her to turn off the fingerprint at will. One application of visual fingerprints relates to augmented reality, in which an individual looks at other people through her camera-enabled glass (e.g., Google Glass) and views information about them. Another application is in privacy-preserving pictures ? Alice should be able to broadcast her "temporary fingerprint" to all cameras in the vicinity along with a privacy preference, saying "remove me". If a stranger?s video happens to include Alice, the device can recognize her fingerprint in the video and erase her completely. This paper develops the core visual fingerprinting engine ? InSight ? on the platform of Android smartphones and a backend server running MATLAB and OpenCV. Results from real world experiments show that 12 individuals can be discriminated with 90% accuracy using 6 seconds of video/motion observations. Video based emulation confirms scalability up to 40 users.},

 abstract = {This video is a demonstration of the work discussed in our full paper available in the MobiSys'15 proceedings. The video illustrates a sensing technology for fine-grained location classification in an urban environment, for enhancing pedestrian safety. Our system seeks to detect the transitions from sidewalk locations to in-street locations, to enable applications such as alerting texting pedestrians when they step into the street. Existing positioning technologies are not sufficiently precise to allow distinguishing a position on the sidewalk from a position in the street, as explored in our previous work. To this end, we use shoe-mounted inertial sensors for location classification based on surface gradient profile and step patterns. This approach is different from existing shoe sensing solutions that focus on dead reckoning and inertial navigation. The shoe sensors relay inertial sensor measurements to a smartphone, which extracts the step pattern and the inclination of the ground a pedestrian is walking on. This allows detecting transitions such as stepping over a curb or walking down sidewalk ramps that lead into the street. We carried out walking trials in metropolitan environments in United States (Manhattan) and Europe (Turin). The results from these experiments show that we can accurately determine transitions between sidewalk and street locations to identify pedestrian risk.},

While there is much discussion, awareness, and proposed use of such barcodes, both in aca-demia and in industry, to our knowledge there has not been a systematic and in-depth analysis of the actual ecosystem surrounding these codes. To fill this gap, we analyze a log of all scans performed by users of a popular QR and barcode scanning app available for Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone. Our dataset includes over 87 million scans performed over a 10-month period from May 2013 to March 2014. We examine general use patterns of QR and barcodes in the wild and identify common and uncommon uses and misuses. We see the presence of both conventional (e.g., web) and emerging (e.g., Bitcoin) uses of QR codes, and develop an informed understanding of the types of QR codes being created and how users interact with QR and barcodes in the wild.},

 abstract = {Mobile and embedded system software designer are often torn between choosing security and functionality. In particular, the security of out-of-band execution environment is sensitive to rich functionality. ARM TrustZone has been used to develop a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which runs in parallel with rich functionality commodity OS and provides an isolated and tamper-resistant execution context for trusted applications. ARM TrustZone splits access of the processor, memory and peripherals into two different worlds, namely normal world and secure world. The secure world is more privileged and the recommended context to implement TEE. However, despite the security of TrustZone TEE, the functionality is very limited. Hardware virtualization could balance the tradeoff between security and functionality by creating two VMes atop of the hardware. However, most of embedded and mobile devices lack hardware virtualization support, which makes it hard to deploy. Red-green dual-OS design, which provides a highly-protected and constrained trusted environment ("green" OS) to perform secure sensitive tasks and a general purpose environment ("red" OS) for all other tasks and applications, is an attractive design to achieve both security and functionality. Red-green dual-OS architecture uses resources partition instead of virtualization to achieve its goal and has been deployed in many mobile devices by running the red OS in normal world and the green OS in secure world of ARM TrustZone. However, even red-green dual-OS provides an isolated environment and rich functionality, the two OSes are not created equally: a compromise of the green OS would also result in the compromise of the red OS since secure world is more privileged. We show that how TVisor, a lightweight dual-OS architecture that creates two born-equal OS and each of them could still use the secure services of TEE in secure world, balances security and functionality for mobile devices. TVisor could be deployed to many low-cost embedded and mobile devices which are equipped with ARM TrustZone but without hardware virtualization support.},

 abstract = {Mobile data traffic is set to triple in three years from now according to Cisco. This trend is a real challenge for operators since wireless capacity is bounded. To boost network capacity further, operators think about paradigm-shifting solutions to relieve their infrastructures. Recently, data offloading received increasing attention from the research community. Operators may leverage unused bandwidth across different technologies to shift part of the traffic onto less critical infrastructure (e.g., through Wi-Fi access points). In a further evolution, they can also benefit from the widespread diffusion of smart mobile devices with multiple communication interfaces. Users become the heart of the offloading strategy by employing multi-hop opportunistic communications to improve content dissemination, while reducing the load on the wireless infrastructure. We propose an architecture that takes advantage of the latest advances in opportunistic networking to achieve efficient traffic offloading. In this approach, terminals are under continuous control of the operator - the cellular infrastructure serves as a control channel to track data dissemination. The demonstration builds on DROiD [2] as injection strategy, and Epics [1] to distribute data opportunistically.},

 abstract = {Recent literatures have demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of light-to-camera communications. They either use this new technology to realize specific applications, e.g., localization, by sending repetitive signal patterns, or consider non-line-of-sight scenarios. We however notice that line-of-sight light-to-camera communications has a great potential because it provides a natural way to enable visual association, i.e., visually associating the received information with the transmitter's identity. Such capability benefits broader applications, such as augmented reality, advertising, and driver assistance systems. Hence, this paper designs, implements, and evaluates RollingLight, a line-of-sight light-to-camera communication system that enables a light to talk to diverse off-the-shelf rolling shutter cameras. To boost the data rate and enhance reliability, RollingLight addresses the following practical challenges. First, its demodulation algorithm allows cameras with heterogeneous sampling rates to accurately decode high-order frequency modulation in real-time. Second, it incorporates a number of designs to resolve the issues caused by inherently unsynchronized light-to-camera channels. We have built a prototype of RollingLight with USRP-N200, and also implemented a real system with Arduino Mega 2560, both tested with a range of different camera receivers. We also implement a real iOS application to examine our real-time decoding capability. The experimental results show that, even to serve commodity cameras with a large variety of frame rates, RollingLight can still deliver a throughput of 11.32 bytes per second.},

@inproceedings{Gordon:2015:AMA:2742647.2742649,
 abstract = {Mobile devices have less computational power and poorer Internet connections than other computers. Computation offload, in which some portions of an application are migrated to a server, has been proposed as one way to remedy this deficiency. Yet, partition-based offload is challenging because it requires applications to accurately predict whether mobile or remote computation will be faster, and it requires that the computation be large enough to overcome the cost of shipping state to and from the server. Further, offload does not currently benefit network-intensive applications. In this paper, we introduce Tango, a new method for using a remote server to accelerate mobile applications. Tango replicates the application and executes it on both the client and the server. Since either the client or the server execution may be faster during different phases of the application, Tango allows either replica to lead the execution. Tango attempts to reduces user-perceived application latency by predicting which replica will be faster and allowing it to lead execution and display output, leveraging the better network and computation resources of the server when the application can benefit from it. It uses techniques inspired by deterministic replay to keep the two replicas in sync, and it uses flip-flop replication to allow leadership to float between replicas. Tango currently works for several unmodified Android applications. In our results, two computation-heavy applications obtain up to 2-3x speedup, and five network applications obtain from 0 to 2.6x speedup.},

 abstract = {Emerging wearable devices promise a multitude of computer vision-based applications that serve users without active engagement. However, vision algorithms are known to be resource-hungry; and modern mobile systems do not support concurrent application use of the camera. Toward supporting efficient concurrency of vision applications, we report Starfish, a split-process execution system that supports concurrent vision applications by allowing them to share computation and memory objects in a secure and efficient manner. Starfish splits the vision library from an application into a separate process, called the Core, which centrally serves all vision applications. The Core shares library call results among applications, eliminating redundant computation and memory use. Starfish supports unmodified applications and unmodified libraries without needing their source code, and guarantees correctness to the applications. In doing so, Starfish improves both the performance and energy efficiency of concurrent vision applications. Using a prototype implementation on Google Glass, we experimentally demonstrate that Starfish reduces the time spent processing repeated vision library calls by 71% - 97%. When running two to ten concurrent face recognition applications at 0.3 frames per second, Starfish reduces CPU utilization by more than 42% - 80%. Notably, this keeps CPU utilization below 13%, even as the number of applications increases. This reduces system power consumption by 19% - 58%, as Starfish maintains a power consumption at approximately 1210 mW while running the concurrent application workloads.},

 abstract = {This paper presents TypingRing, a wearable ring platform that enables text input into computers of different forms, such as PCs, smartphones, tablets, or even wearables with tiny screens. The basic idea of TypingRing is to have a user wear a ring on his middle finger and let him type on a surface - such as a table, a wall, or his lap. The user types as if a standard QWERTY keyboard is lying underneath his hand but is invisible to him. By using the embedded sensors TypingRing determines what key is pressed by the user. Further, the platform provides visual feedback to the user and communicates with the computing device wirelessly. This paper describes the hardware and software prototype of TypingRing and provides an in-depth evaluation of the platform. Our evaluation shows that TypingRing is capable of detecting and sending key events in real-time with an average accuracy of 98.67%. In a field study, we let seven users type a paragraph with the ring, and we find that TypingRing yields a reasonable typing speed (e.g., 33-50 keys per minute) and their typing speed improves over time.},

 abstract = {The wearable revolution, as a mass-market phenomenon, has finally arrived. As a result, the question of how wearables should evolve over the next 5 to 10 years is assuming an increasing level of societal and commercial importance. A range of open design and system questions are emerging, for instance: How can wearables shift from being largely health and fitness focused to tracking a wider range of life events? What will become the dominant methods through which users interact with wearables and consume the data collected? Are wearables destined to be cloud and/or smartphone dependent for their operation? Towards building the critical mass of understanding and experience necessary to tackle such questions, we have designed and implemented ZOE - a match-box sized (49g) collar- or lapel-worn sensor that pushes the boundary of wearables in an important set of new directions. First, ZOE aims to perform multiple deep sensor inferences that span key aspects of everyday life (viz. personal, social and place information) on continuously sensed data; while also offering this data not only within conventional analytics but also through a speech dialog system that is able to answer impromptu casual questions from users. (Am I more stressed this week than normal?) Crucially, and unlike other rich-sensing or dialog supporting wearables, ZOE achieves this without cloud or smartphone support - this has important side-effects for privacy since all user information can remain on the device. Second, ZOE incorporates the latest innovations in system-on-a-chip technology together with a custom daughter-board to realize a three-tier low-power processor hierarchy. We pair this hardware design with software techniques that manage system latency while still allowing ZOE to remain energy efficient (with a typical lifespan of 30 hours), despite its high sensing workload, small form-factor, and need to remain responsive to user dialog requests.},

 abstract = {Wearable medical sensing devices with wireless capabilities have become the cornerstone of many revolutionary digital health applications that promise to predict and treat major diseases by acquiring and processing health information. Existing wireless wearable devices are connected through radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic wave carriers based on standards such as Bluetooth or WiFi. However, these solutions tend to almost-blindly scale down traditional wireless technologies to the body environment, with little or no attention to the peculiar characteristics of the human body and the severe privacy and security requirements of patients. We contend that this is not the only possible approach, and we present U-Wear, the first networking framework for wearable medical devices based on ultrasonic communications. U-Wear encloses a set of physical, data link and network layer functionalities that can flexibly adapt to application and system requirements to efficiently distribute information between ultrasonic wearable devices. U-Wear also offers reconfiguration functionalities at the application layer to provide a flexible platform to develop medical applications. We design two prototypes that implement U-Wear and operate in the near-ultrasonic frequency range using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) speakers and microphones. Despite the limited bandwidth, i.e., about 2 kHz, and COTS audio hardware components not optimized for operating at high frequency, our prototypes (i) achieve data rates up to 2.76 kbit/s with bit-error-rate lower than 10-5 using a transmission power of 20 mW; (ii) enable multiple nodes to share the medium; and (iii) implement reconfigurable data processing to extract medical parameters from sensors with high accuracy.},

We hope you enjoy this technical material behind the conference that attracts a diverse set of attendees from both academia and industry and is a leading venue for publications and idea exchange on mobile systems. ACM MobiSys 2016 has a highly selective, single-track program featuring research related to mobile systems and applications. It is an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. Our paper review process this year was highly selective. Out of 197 submissions, the technical program committee accepted only 31 for publication and presentation as full papers, yielding an acceptance rate around 15.73%. Submitted papers underwent a rigorous, multistage review process. First, we checked all submissions for compliance, general quality, and topic match. We administratively rejected those not meeting our submission criteria. We assigned 3 reviewers to papers that survived this stage from the program committee and the external review committee. At the conclusion of this stage, those papers where none of the reviewers recommended acceptance were rejected. We then assigned at least 2 additional reviewers from the program committee to papers that survived, thus totaling at least 5 reviews per paper. An online discussion phase then ensued, resulting in the PC recommending 59 papers for discussion at the PC meeting. The PC meeting was held in person in St. Augustine, FL, USA, the day before ACM HotMobile 2016. At the conclusion of the PC meeting, we tentatively accepted 31 papers to the conference. All tentatively accepted papers were assigned shepherds to help ensure that the authors produce a final manuscript that satisfactorily addresses reviewer comments. All shepherded papers were ultimately accepted to the conference. Our program this year covers an exciting set of topics including operating systems, transport, networking, sensing, security and privacy. It also includes a poster/demo session, a panel, and keynote speakers.},

@inproceedings{Wang:2015:DLV:2742647.2745924,
 abstract = {Visible light positioning (VLP) is an emerging positioning technique that utilizes indoor light sources to broadcast archer locations through visible light communication (VLC). Benefited by the densely deployed light lamps, VLP holds the promise for more accurate positioning accuracy than RF based approaches, and thus enables interesting applications such as retail navigation and shelf-level advertising in supermarkets and shopping malls. However, we observe that in existing VLP systems, receiving devices are heavily burdened in handling light flickering for VLC. In order to prevent human from being disturbed, the VLC transmitter lamps have to transmit pulses in a high rate (over 1kHz). Since the pulse rate far exceeds the cameras' sampling capability (30fps), receiver design either requires customized light sensor with cumbersome calibration on receiving signal strength [2] or processing high resolution images to leverage rolling shutter effect of the CMOS camera to decode message [1]. The heavy burden on receiving devices motivated us to try getting rid of light flickers. Since human eyes normally can not perceive changes in polarization, the idea is to modulate polarization instead of intensity for communication. In this demo, we demonstrate the VLC system in our VLP design [3] which realizes this idea. It enables lightweight VLC that is even affordable in wearables (Google Glass), without incurring hardware modification or computation off-loading. Moreover, it also makes other types of illuminating light beyond LED light (even sun light) possible to construct communication, therefore eliminates the barrier for deploying future VLC-based applications. As detailed in the full paper [3], our design was inspired by the liquid crystal display (LCD), from which we borrowed polarizer and liquid crystal. Liquid crystal has the property to change the polarization of bypassing polarized light according to the applied voltage. We use polarizer to polarize illuminating light and leverage liquid crystal to modulate bits through changing the light's polarization. The receiver can thus detect changes in polarization with a polarizing film, through which different polarizations result in different intensities. Since the SNR of such communication channel may significantly vary with the mobility of receiving device, we propose to add a dispersion filter to the transmitter. The dispersion filter can cast different frequency of lights into different polarization directions so that SNR in different receiving directions are evened. With the above techniques, VLC transmitter generates signal in low baud rate and mobile devices can perform VLC through camera directly. The communication is long in distance and lightweight enough for resource-constrained devices since the information is carried in intensity changes rather than certain image patterns in rolling shutter approaches. In this demo, we will illustrate the prototype implementation of the VLC communication system. We use incandescent lamps as illuminating light sources. The transmitter consists of a polarizing film, a liquid crystal layer, a dispersor and a control board. The receiver is demonstrated in Android smartphone with polarizing film in front of the camera. The following demo scenarios are planed to show our design (the demo space higher than 2.4m is preferred): Polarization based VLC modulation can solve the flickering problem. The modulated light provides normal illumination. When viewing the modulated light through a polarizing film, people can feel strong intensity changes. Dispersor and binary color shift keying (BCSK). Transmitter without dispersor results in bad SNR in certain receiving angles. For normal transmitters, color changes can always be observed in different angles. End-to-end VLC communication system. Smartphones with a polarizing film in front of the camera can receive and show transmitted messages from VLC transmitters. The VLC method enables accurate indoor positioning. After successfully receiving location beacons from VLC transmitters, smartphone performs location estimation.},

 abstract = {Delay-tolerant Wi-Fi offloading is known to improve overall mobile network bandwidth at low delay and low cost. Yet, in reality, we rarely find mobile apps that fully support opportunistic Wi-Fi access. This is mainly because it is still challenging to develop delay-tolerant mobile apps due to the complexity of handling network disruptions and delays. In this work, we present Cedos, a practical delay-tolerant mobile network access architecture in which one can easily build a mobile app. Cedos consists of three components. First, it provides a familiar socket API whose semantics conforms to TCP while the underlying protocol, D2TP, transparently handles network disruptions and delays in mobility. Second, Cedos allows the developers to explicitly exploit delays in mobile apps. App developers can express maximum user-specified delays in content download or use the API for real-time buffer management at opportunistic Wi-Fi usage. Third, for backward compatibility to existing TCPbased servers, Cedos provides D2Prox, a protocol-translation Web proxy. D2Prox allows intermittent connections on the mobile device side, but correctly translates Web transactions with traditional TCP servers. We demonstrate the practicality of Cedos by porting mobile Firefox and VLC video streaming client to using the API. We also implement delay/disruption-tolerant podcast client and run a field study with 50 people for eight weeks. We find that up to 92.4% of the podcast traffic is offloaded to Wi-Fi, and one can watch a streaming video in a moving train while offloading 48% of the content to Wi-Fi without a single pause.},

 abstract = {This paper presents Kahawai1, a system that provides high-quality gaming on mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, by offloading a portion of the GPU computation to server-side infrastructure. In contrast with previous thin-client approaches that require a server-side GPU to render the entire content, Kahawai uses collaborative rendering to combine the output of a mobile GPU and a server-side GPU into the displayed output. Compared to a thin client, collaborative rendering requires significantly less network bandwidth between the mobile device and the server to achieve the same visual quality and, unlike a thin client, collaborative rendering supports disconnected operation, allowing a user to play offline - albeit with reduced visual quality. Kahawai implements two separate techniques for collaborative rendering: (1) a mobile device can render each frame with reduced detail while a server sends a stream of per-frame differences to transform each frame into a high detail version, or (2) a mobile device can render a subset of the frames while a server provides the missing frames. Both techniques are compatible with the hardware-accelerated H.264 video decoders found on most modern mobile devices. We implemented a Kahawai prototype and integrated it with the idTech 4 open-source game engine, an advanced engine used by many commercial games. In our evaluation, we show that Kahawai can deliver gameplay at an acceptable frame rate, and achieve high visual quality using as little as one-sixth of the bandwidth of the conventional thin-client approach. Furthermore, a 50-person user study with our prototype shows that Kahawai can deliver the same gaming experience as a thin client under excellent network conditions.},

 abstract = {Cellular network performance is often viewed as primarily dominated by the radio technology. However, reality proves more complex: mobile operators deploy and configure their networks in different ways, and sometimes establish network sharing agreements with other mobile carriers. Moreover, regulators have encouraged newer operational models such as Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) to promote competition. In this paper we draw upon data collected by the ICSI Netalyzr app for Android to characterize how operational decisions, such as network configurations, business models, and relationships between operators introduce diversity in service quality and affect user security and privacy. We delve in detail beyond the radio link and into network configuration and business relationships in six countries. We identify the widespread use of transparent middleboxes such as HTTP and DNS proxies, analyzing how they actively modify user traffic, compromise user privacy, and potentially undermine user security. In addition, we identify network sharing agreements between operators, highlighting the implications of roaming and characterizing the properties of MVNOs, including that a majority are simply rebranded versions of major operators. More broadly, our findings highlight the importance of considering higher-layer relationships when seeking to analyze mobile traffic in a sound fashion.},

 abstract = {We present a contactless solution for detecting sleep apnea events on smartphones. To achieve this, we introduce a novel system that monitors the minute chest and abdomen movements caused by breathing on smartphones. Our system works with the phone away from the subject and can simultaneously identify and track the fine-grained breathing movements from multiple subjects. We do this by transforming the phone into an active sonar system that emits frequency-modulated sound signals and listens to their reflections; our design monitors the minute changes to these reflections to extract the chest movements. Results from a home bedroom environment shows that our design operates efficiently at distances of up to a meter and works even with the subject under a blanket. Building on the above system, we develop algorithms that identify various sleep apnea events including obstructive apnea, central apnea, and hypopnea from the sonar reflections. We deploy our system at the UW Medicine Sleep Center at Harborview and perform a clinical study with 37 patients for a total of 296 hours. Our study demonstrates that the number of respiratory events identified by our system is highly correlated with the ground truth and has a correlation coefficient of 0.9957, 0.9860, and 0.9533 for central apnea, obstructive apnea and hypopnea respectively. Furthermore, the average error in computing of rate of apnea and hypopnea events is as low as 1.9 events/hr.},

 abstract = {Gaming on phones, tablets and laptops is very popular. Cloud gaming - where remote servers perform game execution and rendering on behalf of thin clients that simply send input and display output frames - promises any device the ability to play any game any time. Unfortunately, the reality is that wide-area network latencies are often prohibitive; cellular, Wi-Fi and even wired residential end host round trip times (RTTs) can exceed 100ms, a threshold above which many gamers tend to deem responsiveness unacceptable. In this paper, we present Outatime, a speculative execution system for mobile cloud gaming that is able to mask up to 120ms of network latency. Outatime renders speculative frames of future possible outcomes, delivering them to the client one entire RTT ahead of time, and recovers quickly from mis-speculations when they occur. Clients perceive little latency. To achieve this, Outatime combines: 1) future state prediction; 2) state approximation with image-based rendering and event time-shifting; 3) fast state checkpoint and rollback; and 4) state compression for bandwidth savings. To evaluate the Outatime speculation system, we use two high quality, commercially-released games: a twitch-based first person shooter, Doom 3, and an action role playing game, Fable 3. Through user studies and performance bench- marks, we find that players strongly prefer Outatime to traditional thin-client gaming where the network RTT is fully visible, and that Outatime successfully mimics playing across a low-latency network.},

 abstract = {Motivated by safety challenges resulting from distracted pedestrians, this paper presents a sensing technology for fine-grained location classification in an urban environment. It seeks to detect the transitions from sidewalk locations to in-street locations, to enable applications such as alerting texting pedestrians when they step into the street. In this work, we use shoe-mounted inertial sensors for location classification based on surface gradient profile and step patterns. This approach is different from existing shoe sensing solutions that focus on dead reckoning and inertial navigation. The shoe sensors relay inertial sensor measurements to a smartphone, which extracts the step pattern and the inclination of the ground a pedestrian is walking on. This allows detecting transitions such as stepping over a curb or walking down sidewalk ramps that lead into the street. We carried out walking trials in metropolitan environments in United States (Manhattan) and Europe (Turin). The results from these experiments show that we can accurately determine transitions between sidewalk and street locations to identify pedestrian risk.},

 abstract = {Mobile advertisement (ad for short) is a major financial pillar for developers to provide free mobile apps. However, it is frequently thwarted by ad fraud, where rogue code tricks ad providers by forging ad display or user clicks, or both. With the mobile ad market growing drastically (e.g., from $8.76 billion in 2012 to $17.96 billion in 2013), it is vitally important to provide a verifiable mobile ad framework to detect and prevent ad frauds. Unfortunately, this is notoriously hard as mobile ads usually run in an execution environment with a huge TCB. This paper proposes a verifiable mobile ad framework called AdAttester, based on ARM?s TrustZone technology. AdAttester provides two novel security primitives, namely unforgeable clicks and verifiable display. The two primitives attest that ad-related operations (e.g., user clicks) are initiated by the end user (instead of a bot) and that the ad is displayed intact and timely. AdAttester leverages the secure world of TrustZone to implement these two primitives to collect proofs, which are piggybacked on ad requests to ad providers for attestation. AdAttester is non-intrusive to mobile users and can be incrementally deployed in existing ad ecosystem. A prototype of AdAttester is implemented for Android running on a Samsung Exynos 4412 board. Evaluation using 182 typical mobile apps with ad frauds shows that AdAttester can accurately distinguish ad fraud from legitimate ad operations, yet incurs small performance overhead and little impact on user experience.},

 abstract = {WiFi Display, also called Miracast, is an emerging technology that allows a mobile device (source) to duplicate its screen content to an external display (sink) via a peer-to-peer WiFi link. Despite its diverse application scenarios and growing popularity, Miracast consumes substantial power due to a combination of video encoding/decoding and transmission. In this paper, we first conduct a measurement study to quantify and model key parameters that scale Miracast's power consumption. We then propose a set of optimization mechanisms to bypass redundant codec operations, reduce video tail traffic, and relocate the Miracast channel dynamically to maximize transmission efficiency. We have implemented this energy-efficient Miracast framework on an Android smartphone. Experimental results show that the legacy Miracast system costs 1.3 to 2.4 Watts. Our framework reduces the power consumption by 29% to 61%, depending on the Miracast application's video traffic patterns. Our optimization mechanisms do not affect the video quality, and can even reduce the latency of certain Miracast applications.},

 abstract = {Detecting how a vehicle is steered and then alarming drivers in real time is of utmost importance to the vehicle and the driver's safety, since fatal accidents are often caused by dan- gerous steering. Existing solutions for detecting dangerous maneuvers are implemented either in only high-end vehicles or on smartphones as mobile applications. However, most of them rely on the use of cameras, the performance of which is seriously constrained by their high visibility requirement. Moreover, such an over/sole-reliance on the use of cameras can be a distraction to the driver. To alleviate these problems, we develop a vehicle steering detection middleware called V-Sense which can run on commodity smartphones without additional sensors or infrastructure support. Instead of using cameras, the core of V-Sense/ senses a vehicle's steering by only utilizing non-vision sensors on the smartphone. We design and evaluate algorithms for detecting and differentiating various vehicle maneuvers, including lane-changes, turns, and driving on curvy roads. Since V-Sense does not rely on use of cameras, its detection of vehicle steering is not affected by the (in)visibility of road objects or other vehicles. We first detail the design, implementation and evaluation of V-Sense and then demonstrate its practicality with two prevalent use cases: camera-free steering detection and fine-grained lane guidance. Our extensive evaluation results show that V-Sense is accurate in determining and differentiating various steering maneuvers, and is thus useful for a wide range of safety-assistance applications without additional sensors or infrastructure.},

 abstract = {While the availability and accessibility of cellular network connectivity have improved in recent years, our ability to diagnose and debug network problems in this environment has not. One key challenge is that many of the network problems occur near the edge of the network where only mobile devices can perceive them, but network and battery resources to conduct measurements from these mobile devices are scarce. Traditional network measurement approaches that use continuous, periodic, or random measurements are either infeasible or ineffective in this environment. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: triggering measurements based on relevant device context such as signal strength and historical performance data, which can inform decisions for when to measure current network performance. This context can be collected locally on the device as well as aggregated at a global scale to schedule measurement based on data collected from multiple devices. By carefully selecting when to conduct a measurement, and using prediction to improve the likelihood that triggered measurements will succeed, we can more reliably measure important network phenomena with less overhead. Using Mobilyzer [3] as a platform for evaluation, we propose an architecture that is sufficiently general to support a wide range of triggered measurement experiments. We demonstrate the use of this framework for measurements on mobile platforms that are traditionally difficult to capture, e.g., handoff measurement. Further, we can use the global scheduler to predict which devices will likely satisfy the preconditions for the triggered measurement to improve the measurement success rate. Compared to previous work [2, 1, 4], ours is the first to propose a general framework to enable context-triggered mobile measurement, leveraging both local and global visibility into context while ensuring low overhead.},

Such practices, albeit convenient, have led to contention between space allocated for users and content reserved for devices, in addition to their visual anti-aesthetics and distractedness. In this paper, we propose INFRAME++, a system that enables concurrent, dual-mode, full-frame communication for both users and devices. INFRAME++ leverages the spatial-temporal flicker-fusion property of human vision system and the fast frame rate of modern display. It multiplexes data onto full-frame video contents through novel complementary frame composition, hierarchical frame structure, and CDMA-like modulation. It thus ensures opportunistic and unobtrusive screen-camera data communication without affecting the primary video-viewing experience for human users. Our prototype and experiments have confirmed its effectiveness of delivering data to devices in its visual communication with imperceptible video artifacts for viewers. INFRAME++ is able to achieve 150-240 kbps at 120FPS over a 24? LCD monitor with one data frame per 12 display frames. It supports up to 360kbps while data:video is 1:6.},

 abstract = {Voice control has emerged as a popular method for interacting with smart-devices such as smartphones, smartwatches etc. Popular voice control applications like Siri and Google Now are already used by a large number of smartphone and tablet users. A major challenge in designing a voice control application is that it requires continuous monitoring of user?s voice input through the microphone. Such applications utilize hotwords such as "Okay Google" or "Hi Galaxy" allowing them to distinguish user?s voice command and her other conversations. A voice control application has to continuously listen for hotwords which significantly increases the energy consumption of the smart-devices. To address this energy efficiency problem of voice control, we present AccelWord in this paper. AccelWord is based on the empirical evidence that accelerometer sensors found in today?s mobile devices are sensitive to user?s voice. We also demonstrate that the effect of user?s voice on accelerometer data is rich enough so that it can be used to detect the hotwords spoken by the user. To achieve the goal of low energy cost but high detection accuracy, we combat multiple challenges, e.g. how to extract unique signatures of user?s speaking hotwords only from accelerometer data and how to reduce the interference caused by user?s mobility. We finally implement AccelWord as a standalone application running on Android devices. Comprehensive tests show AccelWord has hotword detection accuracy of 85% in static scenarios and 80% in mobile scenarios. Compared to the microphone based hotword detection applications such as Google Now and Samsung S Voice, AccelWord is 2 times more energy efficient while achieving the accuracy of 98% and 92% in static and mobile scenarios respectively.},

 abstract = {Visible Light Positioning (VLP) provides a promising means to achieve indoor localization with sub-meter accuracy. We observe that the Visible Light Communication (VLC) methods in existing VLP systems rely on intensity-based modulation, and thus they require a high pulse rate to prevent flickering. However, the high pulse rate adds an unnecessary and heavy burden to receiving devices. To eliminate this burden, we propose the polarization-based modulation, which is flicker-free, to enable a low pulse rate VLC. In this way, we make VLP light-weight enough even for resource-constrained wearable devices, e.g. smart glasses. Moreover, the polarization-based VLC can be applied to any illuminating light sources, thereby eliminating the dependency on LED. This paper presents the VLP system PIXEL, which realizes our idea. In PIXEL, we develop three techniques, each of which addresses a design challenge: 1) a novel color-based modulation scheme to handle users? mobility, 2) an adaptive downsampling algorithm to tackle the uneven sampling problem of wearables? low-cost camera and 3) a computational optimization method for the positioning algorithm to enable real-time processing. We implement PIXEL?s hardware using commodity components and develop a software program for both smartphone and Google glass. Our experiments based on the prototype show that PIXEL can provide accurate realtime VLP for wearables and smartphones with camera resolution as coarse as 60 pixel x 80 pixel and CPU frequency as low as 300MHz.},

HiLight leverages the alpha channel, a well-known concept in computer graphics, to encode bits into the pixel translucency change. By removing the need to directly modify pixel RGB values, HiLight overcomes the key bottleneck of existing designs and enables real-time unobtrusive communication while supporting any screen content. We build a HiLight prototype using off-the-shelf smart devices and demonstrate its efficacy and robustness in practical settings.

 abstract = {We present and demonstrate INFRAME++, a novel system that enables concurrent, dual-mode, full-frame communication for both users and devices. It achieves unobtrusive screen-camera data communication without affecting the primary video-viewing experience for human users. It leverages the capability discrepancy and distinctive features of the human vision system and devices (modern display and camera). We have implemented INFRAME++ as a PC-phone application. Both communication will be realized through multiplexed videos frames which will be displayed on a modern monitor (120FPS) and captured by a smartphone camera for data decoding. In this demonstration (Figure 1), we will show that INFRAME++ can yield normal video-viewing experience for humans, and high-rate data communication for devices (up to 300 kbps). User participation will be welcome in this live demo.},
