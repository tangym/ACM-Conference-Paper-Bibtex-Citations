 abstract = {Mobile applications that sense continuously, such as location monitoring, are emerging. Despite their usefulness, their adoption in real-world deployment situations has been extremely slow. Many smartphone users are turned away by the drastic battery drain caused by continuous sensing and processing. Also, the extractable contexts from the phone are quite limited due to its position and sensing modalities. In this paper, we propose CoMon, a novel cooperative ambience monitoring platform, which newly addresses the energy problem through opportunistic cooperation among nearby mobile users. To maximize the benefit of cooperation, we develop two key techniques, (1) continuity-aware cooperator detection and (2) benefit-aware negotiation. The former employs heuristics to detect cooperators who will remain in the vicinity for a long period of time, while the latter automatically devises a cooperation plan that provides mutual benefit to cooperators, while considering running applications, available devices, and user policies. Through continuity- and benefit-aware operation, CoMon enables applications to monitor the environment at much lower energy consumption. We implement and deploy a CoMon prototype and show that it provides significant benefit for mobile sensing applications.},

 abstract = {With the proliferation of e-commerce, e-wallet, and e-health smartphone applications, the need for trusted mobile applications is greater than ever. Unlike their desktop counterparts, many mobile applications rely heavily on sensor inputs. As a result, trust often requires authenticity and integrity of sensor readings. For example, applications may need trusted readings from sensors such as a GPS, camera, or microphone. Recent research has started to recognize the need for "trusted sensors", yet providing the right programming abstractions and system support for building mobile trusted applications is an open problem. This paper proposes two software abstractions for offering trusted sensors to mobile applications. We present the design and implementation of these abstractions on both x86 and ARM platforms. We implement a trusted GPS sensor on both platforms, and we provide a privacy control for trusted location using differential privacy. Our evaluation shows that implementing these abstractions comes with moderate overhead on both x86 and ARM platforms. We find these software abstractions to be versatile and practical - using them we implement one novel enterprise mobile application.},

 abstract = {Prefetching is a double-edged sword. It can hide the latency of data transfers over poor and intermittently connected wireless networks, but the costs of prefetching in terms of increased energy and cellular data usage are potentially substantial, particularly for data prefetched incorrectly. Weighing the costs and benefits of prefetching is complex, and consequently most mobile applications employ simple but sub-optimal strategies. Rather than leave the job to applications, we argue that the underlying mobile system should provide explicit prefetching support. Our prototype, IMP, presents a simple interface that hides the complexity of the prefetching decision. IMP uses a cost-benefit analysis to decide when to prefetch data. It employs goal-directed adaptation to try to minimize application response time while meeting budgets for battery lifetime and cellular data usage. IMP opportunistically uses available networks while ensuring that prefetches do not degrade network performance for foreground activity. It tracks hit rates for past prefetches and accounts for network-specific costs in order to dynamically adapt its prefetching strategy to both the network conditions and the accuracy of application prefetch disclosures. Experiments with email and news reader applications show that IMP provides predictable usage of budgeted resources, while lowering application response time compared to the oblivious strategies used by current applications.},

However, building complex network protocol stacks for small resource-constrained devices is more than just porting a reference implementation. Due to the cost pressure in this area especially the memory footprint has to be minimized. Therefore, embedded TCP/IP implementations tend to be statically configurable with respect to the concrete application scenario. This paper describes our software engineering approach for building CiAO/IP - a tailorable TCP/IP stack for small embedded systems, which pushes the limits of static configurability while retaining source code maintainability. Our evaluation results show that CiAO/IP thereby outperforms both lwIP and uIP in terms of code size (up to 90% less than uIP), throughput (up to 20% higher than lwIP), energy consumption (at least 40% lower than uIP) and, most importantly, tailorability.},

 abstract = {The major challenge for accurate fingerprint-based indoor localization is the design of robust and discriminative wireless signatures. Even though WiFi RSSI signatures are widely available indoors, they vary significantly over time and are susceptible to human presence, multipath, and fading due to the high operating frequency. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use FM broadcast radio signals for robust indoor fingerprinting. Because of the lower frequency, FM signals are less susceptible to human presence, multipath and fading, they exhibit exceptional indoor penetration, and according to our experimental study they vary less over time when compared to WiFi signals. In this work, we demonstrate through a detailed experimental study in 3 different buildings across the US, that FM radio signal RSSI values can be used to achieve room-level indoor localization with similar or better accuracy to the one achieved by WiFi signals. Furthermore, we propose to use additional signal quality indicators at the physical layer (i.e., SNR, multipath etc.) to augment the wireless signature, and show that localization accuracy can be further improved by more than 5%. More importantly, we experimentally demonstrate that the localization errors of FM andWiFi signals are independent. When FM and WiFi signals are combined to generate wireless fingerprints, the localization accuracy increases as much as 83% (when accounting for wireless signal temporal variations) compared to when WiFi RSSI only is used as a signature.},

 abstract = {Online video chat services such as Chatroulette [1] and Omegle [2] that randomly match pairs of users in video chat sessions have become increasingly popular, with over twenty thousand online users at anytime during a day. A key problem encountered in such systems is the presence of misbehaving users ("flashers") and obscene content. Our previous works [3] [4] prove that using some image recognition methods (skin-detection, dense SIFT) and machine learning algorithms could achieve significantly higher recall and better precision for flasher detection. Nowadays, with the rapid development of advanced mobile phones with both front and back cameras, we expect mobile video chat to become a popular extension of online video chat services. However, because of the computation-intensive features used by our previous solutions and mobile phones' hardware limitations such as memory size and CPU capacity, it is difficult to directly apply our previous works to mobile platforms. As smartphones are increasingly equipped with diverse sensing capabilities, we plan to utilize this multi-dimensional sensor information to extend flasher detection on mobile platform. This project explores how we can mine accelerometer and other mobile sensor data to infer some clues to optimize flasher detection accuracy while reducing the computation demands of flasher detection on the mobile device. In this demo, we will show our Android-based mobile video chat system (MVChat) in operation, which extends video chat to the mobile domain, beyond merely online services such as Chatroulette and Omegle. We will show how our previous flasher detection algorithm is capable of detecting misbehaving user video streams in a mobile environment. We will further demonstrate the capability of our system for real-time collection of multi-dimensional mobile sensor data such as acceleration, light, gyroscope, GPS as well as audio and video snapshots. Moreover, we will demonstrate the analysis of mobile sensor data analysis in order to identify key characteristics for detecting flashers on the mobile platform. Based on the Adobe AIR API, we establish our mobile video chat app by RTMFP (Real Time Media Flow Protocol) which is the same as the protocol used by most online video chat services such as Chatroulette and Omegle. It is thus possible to bind our solution with existing video chat services. Safety-permitting, we will show a demo of our client attached to an existing online video chat service. Figure 1 is captured while using our app in a mobile video chat session.},

While backscatter communication has largely been used for extremely small amounts of data transfer (e.g. a 12 byte EPC identifier from an RFID tag), sensors need to use backscatter for continuous and high-volume sensor data transfer. To address this need, we describe a novel link layer that exploits unique characteristics of backscatter communication to optimize throughput. Our system offers several optimizations including 1) understanding of multi-path self-interference characteristics and link metrics that capture these characteristics, 2) design of novel mobility-aware probing techniques that use backscatter link signatures to determine when to probe the channel, 3) bitrate selection algorithms that use link metrics to determine the optimal bitrate, and 4) channel selection mechanism that optimize throughput while remaining compliant within FCC regulations. Our results show upto 3x increase in goodput over other mechanisms across a wide range of channel conditions, scales, and mobility scenarios.},

 abstract = {A new technology breakthrough which allows any standard Bluetooth mobile phone to access information services using the same selective and deliberate gesture envisioned for NFC. This technology is called Bluetooth Touchpoint, and it consists of reconfigurable coverage that combines NFC-like, close-proximity communications with the long-range, roaming solution of today's Bluetooth devices. Phase shifting technology combined with a unique antenna configuration makes this realization possible. Therefore, as the world moves toward contactless, wireless communication links, it is believed that the near ubiquity of Bluetooth in mobile devices makes this technology an excellent choice for delivering the benefits of NFC today without the wait, effort and cost associated with adopting NFC globally. The main technology contribution is a new Bluetooth antenna design. This device is shown in Fig. 1. Instead of a single antenna, an array of antennas is integrated into the radio module. By carefully choosing the phase of radio signals sent at each antenna, constructive interference is created in certain special regions and cancel out the signals in other regions. Combining directionality with power control, the same antenna can be used to achieve three kinds of selectivity in device pairing, tapping, pointing, and approaching. Each is briefly explained below. Tapping - With tapping, the user explicitly place one device against another to make the connection. The key advantage of tapping is the deliberateness. The user knows explicitly which counterpart she is interacting with. Examples include tapping a phone at a sales terminal for payment and scanning a bar code for object identification. Pointing - In this mode of operation, the user points remotely to another device. The experience is best captured by remote control of home appliances. Unlike tapping, the users enjoy a better flexibility and range of the interaction range, without losing the deliberateness. Approaching - Two devices can be paired as long as they are in the proximity of each other. This mode gives users the best mobility as long as it is within the communication range of another device. However, it also loses deliberateness. When multiple target devices are in the same space, users typically need to resolve them manually. For example, with WiFi links, a mobile device can see multiple access points, and the user must select which one to use.},

Their popularity also encourages malware authors to penetrate various mobile marketplaces with malicious applications (or apps). These malicious apps hide in the sheer number of other normal apps, which makes their detection challenging. Existing mobile anti-virus software are inadequate in their reactive nature by relying on known malware samples for signature extraction. In this paper, we propose a proactive scheme to spot zero-day Android malware. Without relying on malware samples and their signatures, our scheme is motivated to assess potential security risks posed by these untrusted apps. Specifically, we have developed an automated system called RiskRanker to scalably analyze whether a particular app exhibits dangerous behavior (e.g., launching a root exploit or sending background SMS messages). The output is then used to produce a prioritized list of reduced apps that merit further investigation. When applied to examine 118,318 total apps collected from various Android markets over September and October 2011, our system takes less than four days to process all of them and effectively reports 3281 risky apps. Among these reported apps, we successfully uncovered 718 malware samples (in 29 families) and 322 of them are zero-day (in 11 families). These results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of RiskRanker to police Android markets of all stripes.},

We harness these opportunities through a system called Object Positioning System (OPS) that achieves reasonable localization accuracy. Our core technique uses computer vision to create an approximate 3D structure of the object and camera, and applies mobile phone sensors to scale and rotate the structure to its absolute configuration. Then, by solving (nonlinear) optimizations on the residual (scaling and rotation) error, we ultimately estimate the object's GPS position. We have developed OPS on Android NexusS phones and experimented with localizing 50 objects in the Duke University campus. We believe that OPS shows promising results, enabling a variety of applications. Our ongoing work is focused on coping with large GPS errors, which proves to be the prime limitation of the current prototype.},

ACE provides user's current context to applications running on it. In addition, it dynamically learns relationships among various context attributes (e.g., whenever the user is Driving, he is not AtHome). ACE exploits these automatically learned relationships for two powerful optimizations. The first is inference caching that allows ACE to opportunistically infer one context attribute (AtHome) from another already-known attribute (Driving), without acquiring any sensor data. The second optimization is speculative sensing that enables ACE to occasionally infer the value of an expensive attribute (e.g., AtHome) by sensing cheaper attributes (e.g., Driving). Our experiments with two real context traces of 105 people and a Windows Phone prototype show that ACE can reduce sensing costs of three context-aware applications by about 4.2x, compared to a raw sensor data cache shared across applications, with a very small memory and processing overhead.},

 abstract = {With widespread adoption and growing sophistication of mobile devices, fraudsters have turned their attention from landlines and wired networks to cellular networks. While security threats to wireless data channels and applications have attracted the most attention, voice-related fraud activities also represent a serious threat to mobile users. In particular, we have seen increasing numbers of incidents where fraudsters deploy malicious apps, e.g., disguised as gaming apps to entice users to download; when invoked, these apps automatically - and without users' knowledge - dial certain (international) phone numbers which charge exorbitantly high fees. Fraudsters also frequently utilize social engineering (e.g., SMS or email spam, Facebook postings) to trick users into dialing these exorbitant fee-charging numbers. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology for detecting voice-related fraud activities using only call records. More specifically, we advance the notion of voice call graphs to represent voice calls from domestic callers to foreign recipients and propose a Markov Clustering based method for isolating dominant fraud activities from these international calls. Using data collected over a two year period from one of the largest cellular networks in the US, we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed fraud detection algorithm and conduct systematic analysis of the identified fraud activities. Our work sheds light on the unique characteristics and trends of fraud activities in cellular networks, and provides guidance on improving and securing hardware/software architecture to prevent these fraud activities.},

 abstract = {The bus arrival time is primary information to most city transport travelers. Excessively long waiting time at bus stops often discourages the travelers and makes them reluctant to take buses. In this paper, we present a bus arrival time prediction system based on bus passengers' participatory sensing. With commodity mobile phones, the bus passengers' surrounding environmental context is effectively collected and utilized to estimate the bus traveling routes and predict bus arrival time at various bus stops. The proposed system solely relies on the collaborative effort of the participating users and is independent from the bus operating companies, so it can be easily adopted to support universal bus service systems without requesting support from particular bus operating companies. Instead of referring to GPS enabled location information, we resolve to more generally available and energy efficient sensing resources, including cell tower signals, movement statuses, audio recordings, etc., which bring less burden to the participatory party and encourage their participation. We develop a prototype system with different types of Android based mobile phones and comprehensively experiment over a 7 week period. The evaluation results suggest that the proposed system achieves outstanding prediction accuracy compared with those bus company initiated and GPS supported solutions. At the same time, the proposed solution is more generally available and energy friendly.},

 abstract = {Despite their immense popularity in recent years, smartphones are and will remain severely limited by their battery life. Preserving this critical resource has driven smartphone OSes to undergo a paradigm shift in power management: by default every component, including the CPU, stays off or in an idle state, unless the app explicitly instructs the OS to keep it on! Such a policy encumbers app developers to explicitly juggle power control APIs exported by the OS to keep the components on, during their active use by the app and off otherwise. The resulting power-encumbered programming unavoidably gives rise to a new class of software energy bugs on smartphones called no-sleep bugs, which arise from mis-handling power control APIs by apps or the framework and result in significant and unexpected battery drainage. This paper makes the first advances towards understanding and automatically detecting software energy bugs on smartphones. It makes the following three contributions: (1) we present the first comprehensive study of real world no-sleep energy bug characteristics; (2) we propose the first automatic solution to detect these bugs based on the classic reaching definitions dataflow analysis algorithm; (3) we provide experimental data showing that our tool accurately detected all 17 known instances of no-sleep bugs and found 34 new bugs in the 73 apps examined.},

As the premier forum for presenting the latest research in mobile and wireless systems, this year's conference attracted a record number of 211 submissions, a sign of continuing vibrancy and increasing maturity of our community. In addition to the strong technical program covering virtually every major topic of mobile systems research, we've incorporated a new video program showcasing innovative ideas selected from submissions, and have continued the tradition of having an interactive demo and poster fest. The Technical Program Committee and Industrial Reviewer Panel are to be lauded for their extraordinary effort in vetting each paper with care during the rigorous review process. Each paper was assigned to three Program Committee members for a first round of reviews. Each of the 211 papers with at least one positive review (weak accept) was assigned two additional reviewers from the Program Committee in the second round. A paper with potential industrial applications was further assigned to an Industrial Reviewer Committee member. In all, the Program Committee members and industrial reviewers generated 866 reviews and the top 60 papers received at least 5 reviews. The Program Committee met for a full day at Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA. The Committee discussed the top 60 papers and accepted 33 papers for the program. Each of these 33 papers was shepherded by a member of the Program Committee, to ensure that recommendations made by the reviewers and during the Program Committee meeting were satisfactorily addressed. The resulting technical program is the fruit of labor by many. We want to thank all the authors of submitted papers. We are indebted to the Technical Program Committee and Industry Reviewer Panel for their extraordinary work in reviewing papers and providing feedback for the authors, and the Video Program Committee for reviewing and selecting the short videos. We hope you will find the program interesting and thought-provoking, and you will take this opportunity to share your ideas while also networking with other researchers and practitioners from around the world.},

 abstract = {We propose UnLoc, an unsupervised indoor localization scheme that bypasses the need for war-driving. Our key observation is that certain locations in an indoor environment present identifiable signatures on one or more sensing dimensions. An elevator, for instance, imposes a distinct pattern on a smartphone's accelerometer; a corridor-corner may overhear a unique set of WiFi access points; a specific spot may experience an unusual magnetic fluctuation. We hypothesize that these kind of signatures naturally exist in the environment, and can be envisioned as internal landmarks of a building. Mobile devices that "sense" these landmarks can recalibrate their locations, while dead-reckoning schemes can track them between landmarks. Results from 3 different indoor settings, including a shopping mall, demonstrate median location errors of 1:69m. War-driving is not necessary, neither are floorplans the system simultaneously computes the locations of users and landmarks, in a manner that they converge reasonably quickly. We believe this is an unconventional approach to indoor localization, holding promise for real-world deployment.},

 abstract = {Mobile gaming is a big driver of app marketplaces. However, few mobile games deliver truly distinctive gameplay experiences for ad hoc collocated users. As an example of such an experience, consider a sword fight dual between two users facing each other where each user's phone simulates a sword. With phone in hand, the users' thrusts and blocks translate to attacks and counterattacks in the game. Such Phone-to-Phone Mobile Motion Games (MMG) represent interesting and novel gameplay for ad hoc users in the same location. One enabler for an MMG game like sword fight is continuous, accurate distance ranging. Existing ranging schemes cannot meet the stringent requirements of MMG games: speed, accuracy and noise robustness. In this work, we design FAR, a new ranging scheme that can localize at 12Hz with 2cm median error while withstanding up to 0dB noise, multipath and Doppler effect issues. Our implementation runs on commodity smartphones and does not require any external infrastructure. Moreover, distance measurement accuracy is comparable to that of Kinect, a fixed-infrastructure motion capture system. Evaluation on users playing two prototype games indicate that FAR can fully support dynamic game motion in real-time.},

We find evidence that channel responses from multiple OFDM subcarriers can be a promising location signature. While these signatures certainly vary over time and environmental mobility, we notice that their core structure preserves certain properties that are amenable to localization. We attempt to harness these opportunities through a functional system called PinLoc, implemented on off-the-shelf Intel 5300 cards. We evaluate the system in a busy engineering building, a crowded student center, a cafeteria, and at the Duke University museum, and demonstrate localization accuracies in the granularity of 1m x 1m boxes, called "spots". Results from 100 spots show that PinLoc is able to localize users to the correct spot with 89% mean accuracy, while incurring less than 6% false positives. We believe this is an important step forward, compared to the best indoor localization schemes of today, such as Horus.},

 abstract = {With the recent advent of 4G LTE networks, there has been increasing interest to better understand the performance and power characteristics, compared with 3G/WiFi networks. In this paper, we take one of the first steps in this direction. Using a publicly deployed tool we designed for Android called 4GTest attracting more than 3000 users within 2 months and extensive local experiments, we study the network performance of LTE networks and compare with other types of mobile networks. We observe LTE generally has significantly higher downlink and uplink throughput than 3G and even WiFi, with a median value of 13Mbps and 6Mbps, respectively. We develop the first empirically derived comprehensive power model of a commercial LTE network with less than 6% error rate and state transitions matching the specifications. Using a comprehensive data set consisting of 5-month traces of 20 smartphone users, we carefully investigate the energy usage in 3G, LTE, and WiFi networks and evaluate the impact of configuring LTE-related parameters. Despite several new power saving improvements, we find that LTE is as much as 23 times less power efficient compared with WiFi, and even less power efficient than 3G, based on the user traces and the long high power tail is found to be a key contributor. In addition, we perform case studies of several popular applications on Android in LTE and identify that the performance bottleneck for web-based applications lies less in the network, compared to our previous study in 3G [24]. Instead, the device's processing power, despite the significant improvement compared to our analysis two years ago, becomes more of a bottleneck.},

 abstract = {Models of human mobility have broad applicability in fields such as mobile computing, urban planning, and ecology. This paper proposes and evaluates WHERE, a novel approach to modeling how large populations move within different metropolitan areas. WHERE takes as input spatial and temporal probability distributions drawn from empirical data, such as Call Detail Records (CDRs) from a cellular telephone network, and produces synthetic CDRs for a synthetic population. We have validated WHERE against billions of anonymous location samples for hundreds of thousands of phones in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. We found that WHERE offers significantly higher fidelity than other modeling approaches. For example, daily range of travel statistics fall within one mile of their true values, an improvement of more than 14 times over a Weighted Random Waypoint model. Our modeling techniques and synthetic CDRs can be applied to a wide range of problems while avoiding many of the privacy concerns surrounding real CDRs.},

 abstract = {Smartphones can now connect to a variety of external sensors over wired and wireless channels. However, ensuring proper device interaction can be burdensome, especially when a single application needs to integrate with a number of sensors using different communication channels and data formats. This paper presents a framework to simplify the interface between a variety of external sensors and consumer Android devices. The framework simplifies both application and driver development with abstractions that separate responsibilities between the user application, sensor framework, and device driver. These abstractions facilitate a componentized framework that allows developers to focus on writing minimal pieces of sensor-specific code enabling an ecosystem of reusable sensor drivers. The paper explores three alternative architectures for application-level drivers to understand trade-offs in performance, device portability, simplicity, and deployment ease. We explore these tradeoffs in the context of four sensing applications designed to support our work in the developing world. They highlight a range of sensor usage models for our application-level driver framework that vary data types, configuration methods, communication channels, and sampling rates to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.},

Our key observation is that certain locations in an indoor environment present an identifiable signature on one or more sensing dimensions. An elevator, for instance, imposes a distinct pattern on a smartphone's accelerometer; a specific spot may experience an unusual magnetic fluctuation. This form of urban sensing and activity recognition has already been demonstrated in literature [2, 3], but not yet applied in pure localization applications. We hypothesize that these kind of signatures naturally exist in the environment and can be envisioned as internal landmarks of a building. Mobile devices that "sense" these landmarks can recalibrate their locations, while dead-reckoning schemes can track them between landmarks. Neither war-driving nor floorplans are necessary - the system simultaneously computes the locations of users and landmarks, in a manner so that they converge reasonably quickly. We believe this is an unconventional approach to indoor localization, holding promise for real-world deployment.},

 abstract = {Mobile computing and sensing technologies present exciting opportunities for healthcare. Prescription wireless sensors worn by patients can automatically deliver medical data to care providers, dramatically improving their ability to diagnose, monitor, and manage a range of medical conditions. Using the mobile phones that patients already carry to provide connectivity between sensors and providers is essential to keeping costs low and deployments simple. Unfortunately, software-based attacks against phones are also on the rise, and successful attacks on privacy-sensitive and safety-critical applications can have significant consequences for patients. In this paper, we describe Plug-n-Trust (PnT), a novel approach to protecting both the confidentiality and integrity of safety-critical medical sensing and data processing on vulnerable mobile phones. With PnT, a plug-in smart card provides a trusted computing environment, keeping data safe even on a compromised mobile phone. By design, PnT is simple to use and deploy, while providing a flexible programming interface amenable to a wide range of applications. We describe our implementation, designed for Java-based smart cards and Android phones, in which we use a split-computation model with a novel path hashing technique to verify proper behavior without exposing confidential data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that PnT achieves its security goals while incurring acceptable overhead.},

 abstract = {Reducing the energy consumed in the use of smart phones has become a major challenge for application developers. While this problem can be addressed at various levels, it is important to reduce the energy consumption of individual applications which can vary greatly depending on the behavior of the application. Energy profiling methods are required in order to identify the points in which the applications are consuming excessive energy and to examine how to reduce overall energy consumption by applications. The existing power estimating method[1, 2] can estimate the energy consumption of entire terminal using data obtained from the OS (e.g. CPU-time, amount of access to file systems, traffic, etc.). It is, however, unable to identify points where excessive energy is consumed and to take into account all possible usage patterns and environments since developers are able to use the limited number of test cases in the profiling. This paper proposes a novel method to analyze and visualize energy consumption of applications that run on Android OS under actual users' real usage. This method consists of four phases: 1) embedding logging codes to obtain hardware resource consumption from the OS for estimating the energy consumption in an application using AspectJ[3], 2) distributing the application to the users, 3) gathering that data from the application, and 4) creating visual of the data. To explore the potential of the method, we profiled Crowdroid[4], an open-source twitter client, with four users and estimated the energy consumption for each activity with our method. An activity in the Android is an object that corresponds to the screen of the application. In order to calculate energy consumption from data we logged, we employ a model for estimation proposed by the existing power estimating method[1].},

Unfortunately, even the basic primitive of launching a mobile app is sorrowfully sluggish: 20 seconds of delay is not uncommon even for very popular apps. We have designed and built FALCON to remedy slow app launch. FALCON uses contexts such as user location and temporal access patterns to predict app launches before they occur. FALCON then provides systems support for effective app-specific prelaunching, which can dramatically reduce perceived delay. FALCON uses novel features derived through extensive data analysis, and a novel cost-benefit learning algorithm that has strong predictive performance and low runtime overhead. Trace-based analysis shows that an average user saves around 6 seconds per app startup time with daily energy cost of no more than 2% battery life, and on average gets content that is only 3 minutes old at launch without needing to wait for content to update. FALCON is implemented as an OS modification to the Windows Phone OS.},

This year's conference continues the MobiSys tradition of being the premier forum for presentation of research in mobile and wireless systems. The call for papers attracted 182 submissions. This was a new record for MobiSys and a strong sign that of the vibrancy of our community. Each paper was assigned to two Program Committee members for a first round of reviews. Each of the 155 papers with at least one review of "weak reject" was assigned an additional reviewer from the Program Committee in the second round. In the final round, we assigned an additional pair of reviewers or more to each of the top 88 papers. In all the Program Committee members and external reviewers generated 724 reviews and the top 88 papers received at least 5 reviews. The Program Committee met for a full day at La Jolla, CA. The Committee discussed the top 60 papers and accepted 32 papers for the program. The 32 paper count is another record high for MobiSys and shows that there is a great deal of high quality work coming from our community. Each of these 32 papers was shepherded by a member of the Program Committee to help ensure that recommendations made by the reviewers and during the Program Committee meeting were addressed. There were several new additions to the review process. First, we created an External Review Panel composed of people active in the mobile computing industry. In addition to getting the valuable opinions of these experts, a secondary goal of the panel was to increase the interaction between these industry leaders and the MobiSys community. Second, we had the Program Committee generate a single public review for each accepted paper. The public review highlights the key contributions of the paper that convinced the Program Committee to accept the paper and some of the remaining weaknesses in the paper. These public reviews were posted on an online forum (http://reviews.mobisys2012.rice.edu/) to help promote community discussion on each paper.},

While precise tap detection is nontrivial, requiring machine learning algorithms to identify fingerprints of closely spaced keys, sensitive sensors on modern devices aid the process. We present TapPrints, a framework for inferring the location of taps on mobile device touch-screens using motion sensor data combined with machine learning analysis. By running tests on two different off-the-shelf smartphones and a tablet computer we show that identifying tap locations on the screen and inferring English letters could be done with up to 90% and 80% accuracy, respectively. By optimizing the core tap detection capability with additional information, such as contextual priors, we are able to further magnify the core threat.},

 abstract = {Mobile application development is challenging for several reasons: intermittent and limited network connectivity, tight power constraints, server-side scalability concerns, and a number of fault-tolerance issues. Developers handcraft complex solutions that include client-side caching, conflict resolution, disconnection tolerance, and backend database sharding. To simplify mobile app development, we present Mobius, a system that addresses the messaging and data management challenges of mobile application development. Mobius introduces MUD (Messaging Unified with Data). MUD presents the programming abstraction of a logical table of data that spans devices and clouds. Applications using Mobius can asynchronously read from/write to MUD tables, and also receive notifications when tables change via continuous queries on the tables. The system combines dynamic client-side caching (with intelligent policies chosen on the server-side, based on usage patterns across multiple applications), notification services, flexible query processing, and a scalable and highly available cloud storage system. We present an initial prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of our design. Even in our initial prototype, remote read and write latency overhead is less than 52% when compared to a hand-tuned solution. Our dynamic caching reduces the number of messages by a factor of 4 to 8.5 when compared to fixed strategies, thus reducing latency, bandwidth, power, and server load costs, while also reducing data staleness.},

 abstract = {The ubiquity of smartphones and their on-board sensing capabilities motivates crowd-sensing, a capability that harnesses the power of crowds to collect sensor data from a large number of mobile phone users. Unlike previous work on wireless sensing, crowd-sensing poses several novel requirements: support for humans-in-the-loop to trigger sensing actions or review results, the need for incentives, as well as privacy and security. Beyond existing crowd-sourcing systems, crowd-sensing exploits sensing and processing capabilities of mobile devices. In this paper, we design and implement Medusa, a novel programming framework for crowd-sensing that satisfies these requirements. Medusa provides high-level abstractions for specifying the steps required to complete a crowd-sensing task, and employs a distributed runtime system that coordinates the execution of these tasks between smartphones and a cluster on the cloud. We have implemented ten crowd-sensing tasks on a prototype of Medusa. We find that Medusa task descriptions are two orders of magnitude smaller than standalone systems required to implement those crowd-sensing tasks, and the runtime has low overhead and is robust to dynamics and resource attacks.},

 abstract = {In this work, we are interested in a scenario where a group of smartphone users, within proximity of each other, are interested in watching the same video at the same time. The default operation today is that each user with a cellular connection downloads the video independently from the server. However, each phone's individual cellular connection may not be sufficient for providing high video quality. We propose a novel cooperative scheme, called MicroCast, for video streaming to a group of smartphones within proximity of each other. Each phone utilizes simultaneously two network interfaces: one (cellular) to connect to the video server and download parts of the video and the other (WiFi) to connect to the rest of the group and exchange downloaded parts. Fig. 1 illustrates MicroCast scenario. First, we propose a scheduling algorithm, MicroDownload, that decides which parts of the video each phone should download from the server, based on the phones' download rate. Second, we propose a novel all-to-all local dissemination scheme, MicroNC-P2, for sharing content among group members, which outperforms state-of-the-art peer-to-peer schemes in our setting. MicroNC-P2 is explicitly designed to exploit WiFi overhearing and network coding, based on a local broadcast framework, MicroBroadcast, which we developed specifically for Android phones. The full architecture of MicroCast is depicted in Fig. 2. To the best of our knowledge, MicroBroadcast is the first framework that allows smartphones to broadcast in high speed locally. We perform performance evaluation on a testbed consisting of several Android phones, and we show that each component separately as well as the combined system as a whole significantly improve the performance compared to alternative approaches. Furthermore, this improvement comes at no significant battery cost. The detailed description of MicroCast can be found in [1]. A video demo and a poster of MicroCast can be found at [2] and [3]. More supporting materials are provided in [4].},

 abstract = {Web caching in mobile networks is critical due to the unprecedented cellular traffic growth that far exceeds the deployment of cellular infrastructures. Caching on handsets is particularly important as it eliminates all network-related overheads. We perform the first network-wide study of the redundant transfers caused by inefficient web caching on handsets, using a dataset collected from 3 million smartphone users of a large commercial cellular carrier, as well as another five-month-long trace contributed by 20 smartphone users. Our findings suggest that redundant transfers contribute 18% and 20% of the total HTTP traffic volume in the two datasets. Also they are responsible for 17% of the bytes, 7% of the radio energy consumption, 6% of the signaling load, and 9% of the radio resource utilization of all cellular data traffic in the second dataset. Most of such redundant transfers are caused by the smartphone web caching implementation that does not fully support or strictly follow the protocol specification, or by developers not fully utilizing the caching support provided by the libraries. This is further confirmed by our caching tests of 10 popular HTTP libraries and mobile browsers. Improving the cache implementation will bring considerable reduction of network traffic volume, cellular resource consumption, handset energy consumption, and user-perceived latency, benefiting both cellular carriers and customers.},

@inproceedings{Javanmard:2012:PMM:2307636.2307705,
 abstract = {Map matching is the procedure for determining the path of a user on a map from a sequence of location data (which we refer to as track). This process serves as a common preprocessing step for reasoning about traffic on the road network as well as for providing better location-based services [3, 5, 1]. Converting a track to a topological path on a map not only makes it easier to reason about paths, but also leads to reduced storage requirements and more efficient operations on the same. Some examples of such operations are comparison, querying and retrieval of tracks based on similarity to other tracks [1]. Due to its importance, many methods for map matching have been previously proposed [3, 4, 5], focusing on matching a single sufficiently dense and accurate sequence of locations. In this work, we consider the multi-track map matching problem, where we are given a number of tracks generated from trips through the same path, and we wish to recover the underlying path that generates these tracks. The problem is much more challenging than the single-track problem since each track contains a small number of samples (i.e. sampling intervals are large). This captures the realistic scenario where users repeatedly travel on regular routes, and samples are sparsely collected due to restraints in energy consumption on the mobile device. Another scenario is when a service collects users' location information only when the user actively uses such service. In such a scenario, the collected location data can be very sparse. However, since users typically travel on the same (or similar) routes repeatedly, one may compensate the sparseness of the data by combining location data from different trips. The main challenge in multi-track map matching is that in combining data from multiple tracks, global ordering on all samples is not available, a necessary condition for applying existing single-track map matching algorithms. Instead, each track only gives us the order on a subset of locations. If we apply the map matching algorithm on each individual track, we would obtain paths with very poor quality given the low sampling rate on each path. We propose two methods, the iterative projection scheme and the graph Laplacian scheme, to solve the multi-track problem by using a single-track map-matching subroutine. We also propose a boosting technique which may be applied to either approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated paths. In addition, in order to deal with variable sampling rates in single-track map matching subroutine, we revisit the single-track map matching problem and propose a method based on a particular regularized cost function that can be adapted for different sampling rates and measurement errors. The adaptation is in fact done through the regularization parameter λ in the cost function which balances two types of errors in measuring the quality of a path: the data error (fidelity of the path to the data points), and the model error (measuring "niceness" of the obtained path). By analyzing a simplified modeling of the problem, we characterize the optimal choice of λ in terms of the sampling rate and the variance of the measurement errors. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques for reconstructing tracks under several different configurations of sampling error and sampling rate. The evaluations are done on the dataset available in [2]. The data set contains tracks collected from real users in Seattle,WA, using commercially available consumer grade GPS device. Our results indicate that the proposed approaches lead to reasonable estimates of the route, significantly better than what would be achieved in case tracks were map matched individually.},

 abstract = {Wi-Fi tethering (i.e., sharing the Internet connection of a mobile phone via its Wi-Fi interface) is a useful functionality and is widely supported on commercial smartphones. Yet existing Wi-Fi tethering schemes consume excessive power: they keep the Wi-Fi interface in a high power state regardless if there is ongoing traffic or not. In this paper we propose DozyAP to improve the power efficiency of Wi-Fi tethering. Based on measurements in typical applications, we identify many opportunities that a tethering phone could sleep to save power. We design a simple yet reliable sleep protocol to coordinate the sleep schedule of the tethering phone with its clients without requiring tight time synchronization. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage, sleep interval adaptation algorithm to automatically adapt the sleep intervals to ongoing traffic patterns of various applications. DozyAP does not require any changes to the 802.11 protocol and is incrementally deployable through software updates. We have implemented DozyAP on commercial smartphones. Experimental results show that, while retaining comparable user experiences, our implementation can allow the Wi-Fi interface to sleep for up to 88% of the total time in several different applications, and reduce the system power consumption by up to 33% under the restricted programmability of current Wi-Fi hardware.},

This year's conference continues the tradition of providing a highlyselective forum for cutting-edge research that takes a broad systems perspective of mobile computing. Continuing trends from last year, there is a strong showing for research related to smartphones that reflects their growing momentum as powerful, programmable mobile systems. Research on energy-efficiency in many guises is also very popular. A broad set of other topics is represented in the program, covering aspects of security, sensor networks and wireless protocols, and mobile applications and services. We received 141 submissions, roughly a 10% increase from the previous year, as MobiSys continues to grow as a venue. The papers were reviewed as in past years, with a two round review process. Each paper received three reviews during the first round. Half of the papers then advanced to the second round, where they received two further reviews. All told, our tireless PC members produced over 560 reviews. To select the program, we discussed 55 papers at an all-day face-to-face PC meeting directly following the HotMobile workshop in Phoenix, AZ. The resulting program that you see before you features 25 highly-competitive papers. All of these papers were further shepherded by a PC member to improve their presentation. As well as papers, we are very fortunate to have an excellent line-up of speakers who capitalize on our "Washington, DC" location: Dr. Edward Felten will speak in his new role as Chief Technologist for the FTC, and Dr. Douglas Sicker will speak in his role as the Chief Technologist for the FCC. And as is a tradition for MobiSys, the recipient of the SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contributor Award will deliver a keynote; this year we keenly look forward to hearing from Prof. Mahadev "Satya" Satyanarayanan. The technical program also includes an eagerly anticipated event, the poster and demonstration session. This year we have 23 demonstrations and 11 posters that highlight new research! We especially want to thank Moustafa Youssef from EJUST, Egypt for putting together this session as the Posters/Demos Chair.},

 abstract = {The ubiquity of smartphones and their on-board sensing capabilities motivates crowd-sensing, a capability that harnesses the power of crowds to collect sensor data from a large number of mobile phone users. Unlike previous work on wireless sensing, crowd-sensing poses several novel requirements: support for humans-in-the-loop to trigger sensing actions or review results, the need for incentives, as well as privacy and security. Beyond existing crowd-sourcing systems, crowd-sensing exploits sensing and processing capabilities of mobile devices. In this paper, we design and implement Medusa, a novel programming framework for crowd-sensing that satisfies these requirements. Medusa provides high-level abstractions for specifying the steps required to complete a crowd-sensing task, and employs a distributed runtime system that coordinates the execution of these tasks between smartphones and a cluster on the cloud. We have implemented ten crowd-sensing tasks on a prototype of Medusa. We find that Medusa task descriptions are two orders of magnitude smaller than standalone systems required to implement those crowd-sensing tasks, and the runtime has low overhead and is robust to dynamics and resource attacks.},

Time Dependent Pricing (TDP) represents a next step in this direction [1, 2]. With TDP, ISPs can shift traffic to off-peak periods, thus reducing their cost, while consumers save money by choosing the time of usage. TDP uses a feedback control loop between an ISP and its users to account for users' responses to offered prices in optimizing the future prices. We have implemented such a TDP system and are presently conducting a user trial at Princeton while planning larger trials with commercial ISPs. This demo will introduce the audience to our system's ISP- and user-side features. On the ISP side, we show the current network congestion, while on the user side, we show device UIs displaying the offered prices, the device usage history, and automated scheduling of applications to keep users within a specified budget.},

These powerful capabilities have made smartphones an attractive platform for tasking applications. Tasking applications are rapid developing mobile applications which process data from multiple sensors continuously to determine user's context (such as location or activity) and take certain actions based on pre-defined conditions. Examples of such applications include location-based reminders, notifying when friends are nearby, changing the ring-mode of a phone automatically depending on the location, automatically tracking and storing movement tracks when driving, and inferring the number of steps walked each day. However, today, developing tasking applications is non-trivial for two reasons: poor abstractions and poor programming support [1]. We address these shortcomings through Code In The Air (CITA), a system that simplifies the development of tasking applications. CITA achieves this by providing an activity composition framework and a tasking execution framework that allows developers and end-users to easily write and compose tasks.},

Further, the recent advances of mobile devices and wireless networking will make such social engagement more pervasive - people carry portable exergame devices (e.g., jump ropes) and interact with remote users anytime, anywhere. Towards this goal, we explore the potential of using heterogeneous exercise devices as game controllers for a multi-player social exergame; e.g., playing a boat paddling game with two remote exercisers (one with a jump rope, and the other with a treadmill). In this paper, we propose a novel platform called ExerLink that converts exercise intensity to game inputs and intelligently balances intensity/delay variations for fair game play experiences. We report the design considerations and guidelines obtained from the design and development processes of game controllers. We validate the efficacy of game controllers and demonstrate the feasibility of social exergames with heterogeneous exercise devices via extensive human subject studies.},

Our system, called WiRover, has been running on these buses since April 2010 for about 18 months till date providing a WiFi hotspot to which bus passengers can connect. As of Dec. 1, 2011 we have observed 17,567 unique client devices connect to the WiRover system. These devices have downloaded more than 337.53 GB and uploaded 48.19 GB of content through our system. Since the initial deployment, the buses have logged more than 9,331 hours of operation and have traveled over much of the northern Midwest of the United States. Through this paper we provide different insights acquired in deploying and running a continuous service with real users, present various user and usage characteristics in these systems, discuss various design and management strategies for these networks, and explore different network traffic optimizations possible.},

 abstract = {This paper describes the design, deployment, and empirical evaluation of WIISARD - a novel emergency response system that provides reliable communication in dynamic wireless environments without extensive communication infrastructure. The main contribution of this paper is an in-depth empirical study of network properties that emerge during a drill in which WIISARD is deployed with minimal infrastructure support. The drill involves 19 first responders and 41 victims. The properties of links established among first responders vary between phases of the drill and depend upon the responder's role in the drill. The rescue phase - in which responders are highly mobile as they triage victims - poses significant challenges to reliable communication. During this phase, the contacts between responders are short-lived; however, they are reestablished within minutes. Once a contact between responders is established, the quality of the link between those responders is usually high. The connectivity graph observed during the rescue phase is usually connected and has a small diameter although there are times when it has a large diameter or it is partitioned. While mobility increases network dynamics, we also observe that the mobility patterns characteristic of the emergency response workflow can be leveraged to disseminate data efficiently through data muling. WIISARD employs a gossip-based protocol and supports data dissemination through local communication and data muling to achieve 98% reliability during the drill exercise. These results indicate the feasibility of providing reliable communication in emergency response with minimal infrastructure in spite of network dynamics.},

 abstract = {Despite its simplicity there exists, as yet, no position-based routing that is suitable for dynamic networks: Existing schemes construct subgraphs or overlays that come at a cost that may be too high. In a network where nodes are mobile, such constructions risk becoming stale before they become stable, potentially invalidating routing decisions. In this work we are investigating position-based routing for dynamic networks based on left- or right-hand rule (LHR). A node using LHR forwards messages to the neighbour that sits next in rotational order. When used to recover from greedy routing failures, LHR guarantees success if implemented over planar graphs; for this reason it is often called 'face-routing'. We note, however, that if planarity is violated then LHR is only guaranteed to eventually return to the point of origin. We have chosen LHR for two reasons. First, it is most prevalent in position-based routing literature and hence well-studied. Second, it is a simple rule requiring little-to-no overhead. We have started by looking for the specific causes of failure in LHR with the hope that we might quickly recognise and avoid them in mobile environments [1]. First, in the unit disc graph where communication ranges are normalised to 1, we analyze the way in which intersecting links may interact to invoke sides of a 4-gon (Figure 1a). We have provably enumerated all possible configurations to three possible cases. Surprisingly, only one of these configurations is able to defeat LHR. This is because there are two distinct traversals, each of which has the potential to restrict exit points in the other. We call this the 'umbrella' configuration due to its appearance.},

 abstract = {RFID-scale sensors present a new frontier for distributed sensing. In contrast to existing sensor deployments that rely on battery-powered sensors, RFID-scale sensors rely solely on harvested energy. These devices sense and store data when not in contact with a reader, and use backscatter communication to upload data when a reader is in range. Unlike conventional RFID tags that only transmit identifiers, RFID sensors need to transfer potentially large amounts of data to a reader during each contact event. In this paper, we propose several optimizations to the RFID network stack to support efficient bulk transfer while remaining compatible with existing Gen 2 readers. Our key contribution is the design of a coordinated bulk transfer protocol for RFID-scale sensors that maximizes channel utilization and minimizes energy lost due to idle listening while also minimizing collisions. We present an implementation of the protocol for the Intel WISP, and describe several parameters that are tuned using empirical measurements that characterize the wireless channel. Our results show that the burst protocol improves goodput in comparison to vanilla EPC Gen 2 tags, improves energy-efficiency, allows multiple RFID sensors to share the channel, and also coexists with passive, non-sensor tags.},

 abstract = {Trust and anonymity are both desirable properties on the Internet. However, online services and users often have to make the trade off between trust and anonymity due to the lack of usable frameworks for achieving them both. We propose Opaak, a practical anonymous authentication framework. Opaak enables its users to establish identities with different online services while ensuring that these identities cannot be linked with each other or their real identity. In addition, Opaak allows online service providers to control the rate at which users utilize their services while preserving their anonymity. Hence, allowing the service providers to prevent abuse in the form of spam or Sybil attacks, which are prevalent in such online services that offer anonymity. Opaak leverages the mobile phone as a scarce resource combined with anonymous credentials in order to provide these features. We target two kinds of applications for Opaak and identify their requirements in order to achieve both trust and anonymity. We develop efficient protocols for these applications based on anonymous credentials. In addition, we design an architecture that facilitates integration with existing mobile and web applications and allows application developers to transparently utilize our protocols. We implement a prototype on Android and evaluate its performance to demonstrate the practicality of our approach.},

 abstract = {We attempt to localize a distant object by looking at it through a smartphone. As an example use-case, while driving on a highway entering New York, we want to look at one of the skyscrapers through the smartphone camera, and compute its GPS location. While the problem would have been far more difficult five years back, the growing number of sensors on smartphones, combined with advances in computer vision, have opened up important opportunities. We harness these opportunities through a system called Object Positioning System (OPS) [1] that achieves reasonable localization accuracy. Our core technique uses computer vision to create an approximate 3D structure of the object and camera, and applies mobile phone sensors to scale and rotate the structure to its absolute configuration. Then, by solving (nonlinear) optimizations on the residual (scaling and rotation) error, we ultimately estimate the object's GPS position. We present a demonstration of OPS, a system to appear in the MobiSys 2012 main conference. The user is expected to bring the object of interest near the center of her view finder, and take as few as four photographs. GPS and compass readings are also recorded during the process. The position of the photographs can be seperated by a few steps from each other in any direction. OPS uses Structure from Motion to extract keypoints across the photographs to come up with a 3D structure, composed of the object and the camera locations. Finally, OPS minimizes errors in GPS and compass readings with help of 3D structure to converge on the object location.},

@inproceedings{Laoudias:2012:DAI:2307636.2307687,
 abstract = {In this demo paper, we present the Airplace indoor positioning platform developed for Android smartphones [1]. Airplace relies on existing WLAN infrastructure and exploits Received Signal Strength (RSS) values from neighboring Access Points (AP) to infer the unknown user location. Our system utilizes a number of RSS fingerprints collected a priori to build the so-called radiomap. Location is then estimated by finding the best match between the currently measured fingerprint and fingerprints in the radiomap [2]. We will demonstrate the real-time positioning capabilities of Airplace by allowing attendees to carry an Android tablet and viewing their position on a floorplan map, while walking around the demo area1. Our goal is to highlight the effectiveness of various algorithms found in the literature, as well as two state-of-the-art algorithms developed in-house [1]. The Airplace system consists of the RSS Logger and Find Me applications and the Distribution Server, while it follows a mobile-based network-assisted architecture to eliminate the communication overhead and respect user privacy. In a typical scenario, when a user walks inside a building a smartphone client conducts a single communication with our server to receive the RSS radiomap and is then able to position itself independently using the observed RSS values. The RSS Logger application is developed around the Android RSS API for scanning and recording data samples in specific locations at predefined intervals; see Fig. 1a. These samples contain theMAC addresses and RSS levels (in dBm) of all neighboring WLAN APs, as well as the coordinates of the location where the user initiated the recording. The collected data are stored locally in log files and users may contribute their data to our system for building and updating the radiomap through crowdsourcing. The Find Me application is a positioning client that downloads the radiomap from the server, thus enabling the user to self-locate independently thereafter. The interface is shown in Fig. 1b (left), where the user can set the preferences and select any of the available algorithms. Subsequently, the Track Me button can be switched on for tracking the user while walking indoors. In this case, the current location estimate (green circle) is updated every one second, while the past locations are shown as red dots. Our Distribution Server is responsible for the construction and distribution of the radiomap. The server parses all available RSS log files, which may be contributed by several users, and merges the data in a single radiomap file. For the demonstration we will use a Motorola Xoom tablet running Android 3.1 and featuring a 10.1' screen that facilitates presentation. The Distribution Server will be running on a linux-based workstation and clients will use the tablet's built-in WLAN adapter to connect to the server, through the WLAN hotspots at the conference venue, for downloading the radiomap. First, our team will have collected adequate samples before the demo to guarantee good performance. Next, the participants may start positioning themselves with the Find Me application and they will be able to appreciate the potential of indoor location-oriented applications. To make the demo more appealing, a floorplan map of the demo area in .jpg format will be required for facilitating the collection of the data for the radiomap and displaying the location estimates during positioning.},
