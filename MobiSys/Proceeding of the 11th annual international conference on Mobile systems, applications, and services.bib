 abstract = {Cloud offload is an important technique in mobile computing. VM-based cloudlets have been proposed as offload sites for the resource-intensive and latency-sensitive computations typically associated with mobile multimedia applications. Since cloud offload relies on precisely-configured back-end software, it is difficult to support at global scale across cloudlets in multiple domains. To address this problem, we describe just-in-time (JIT) provisioning of cloudlets under the control of an associated mobile device. Using a suite of five representative mobile applications, we demonstrate a prototype system that is capable of provisioning a cloudlet with a non-trivial VM image in 10 seconds. This speed is achieved through dynamic VM synthesis and a series of optimizations to aggressively reduce transfer costs and startup latency.},

PAM consists of a PAM client and a cloud-side PAM service. The PAM client utilizes two inexpensive dust sensors to obtain raw particulate concentration measurement, and two Arduino boards for local filtering, web services, and communication with PAM service. The cloud-side PAM service constructs a statistical model of air quality and provides PAM clients with context-dependent calibration curves. Together, PAM is able to approximate PM2.5, PM10, and AQI measurement for users in-situ and at low cost.},

 abstract = {A recent study showed that while US consumers spent 30% more time on mobile apps than on traditional web, advertisers spent 1600% less money on mobile ads. One key reason is that unlike most web ad providers, today's mobile ads are not contextual---they do not take into account the content of the page they are displayed on. Thus, most mobile ads are irrelevant to what the user is interested in. For example, it is not uncommon to see gambling ads being displayed in a Bible app. This irrelevance results in low clickthrough rates, and hence advertisers shy away from the mobile platform. Using data from top 1200 apps in Windows Phone marketplace, and a one-week trace of ad keywords from Microsoft's ad network, we show that content displayed by mobile apps is a potential goldmine of keywords that advertisers are interested in. However, unlike web pages, which can be crawled and indexed offline for contextual advertising, content shown on mobile apps is often either generated dynamically, or is embedded in the apps themselves; and hence cannot be crawled. The only solution is to scrape the content at runtime, extract keywords and fetch contextually relevant ads. The challenge is to do this without excessive overhead and without violating user privacy. In this paper, we describe a system called SmartAds to address this challenge. We have built a prototype of SmartAds for Windows Phone apps. In a large user study with over 5000 ad impressions, we found that SmartAds nearly doubles the relevance score, while consuming minimal additional resources and preserving user privacy.},

 abstract = {Email is a key application used on smartphones. Even when the phone is in stand-by mode, users expect the phone to continue syncing with an email server to receive new mes-sages. Each such sync operation wakes up the smartphone for data reception and processing. In this paper, we show that this "cost of email sync" in stand-by mode constitutes a significant source of energy consumption, and thus reduces battery life. We quantify the power performance of different existing email clients on two smartphone platforms, An-droid and Windows Phone, and study the impact of system parameters such as email size, inbox size, and pull vs. push. Our results show that existing email clients do not handle email sync in an energy efficient way. This is because the underlying protocols and architectures are not designed for the specific needs of operating in stand-by mode. Based on our findings, we derive general design principles for energy-efficient event handling on smartphones, and apply these principles to the case of email sync and implement our techniques on commercial smartphones. Experimental results show that our techniques are able to significantly reduce energy cost of email sync by 49.9% on average with our experiment settings.},

 abstract = {A major hurdle to frequently performing mobile computer vision tasks is the high power consumption of image sensing. In this work, we report the first publicly known experimental and analytical characterization of CMOS image sensors. We find that modern image sensors are not energy-proportional: energy per pixel is in fact inversely proportional to frame rate and resolution of image capture, and thus image sensor systems fail to provide an important principle of energy-aware system design: trading quality for energy efficiency. We reveal two energy-proportional mechanisms, supported by current image sensors but unused by mobile systems: (i) using an optimal clock frequency reduces the power up to 50% or 30% for low-quality single frame (photo) and sequential frame (video) capturing, respectively; (ii) by entering low-power standby mode between frames, an image sensor achieves almost constant energy per pixel for video capture at low frame rates, resulting in an additional 40% power reduction. We also propose architectural modifications to the image sensor that would further improve operational efficiency. Finally, we use computer vision benchmarks to show the performance and efficiency tradeoffs that can be achieved with existing image sensors. For image registration, a key primitive for image mosaicking and depth estimation, we can achieve a 96% success rate at 3 FPS and 0.1 MP resolution. At these quality metrics, an optimal clock frequency reduces image sensor power consumption by 36% and aggressive standby mode reduces power consumption by 95%.},

As prior work on cyber-crimes suggests, we need to understand the economic incentives of the criminals to design the most effective defenses. In this paper, we investigate application plagiarism on Android markets at a large scale. We take the first step to characterize plagiarized applications and estimate their impact on the original application developers. We first crawled 265,359 free applications from 17 Android markets around the world and ran a tool to identify similar applications ("clones"). Based on the data, we examined properties of the cloned applications, including their distribution across different markets, application categories, and ad libraries. Next, we examined how cloned applications affect the original developers. We captured HTTP advertising traffic generated by mobile applications at a tier-1 US cellular carrier for 12 days. To associate each Android application with its advertising traffic, we extracted a unique advertising identifier (called the client ID) from both the applications and the network traces. We estimate a lower bound on the advertising revenue that cloned applications siphon from the original developers, and the user base that cloned applications divert from the original applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study on the characteristics of cloned mobile applications and their impact on the original developers.},

However, the current economic models and mechanisms for mobile advertising are fundamentally not sustainable and far from ideal. In particular, as we show, applications which use mobile advertising are capable of using significant amounts of a mobile users' critical resources without being controlled or held accountable. This paper seeks to redress this situation by enabling advertisement supported applications to become significantly more ``user-friendly''. To this end, we present the design and implementation of CAMEO, a new framework for mobile advertising that 1) employs intelligent and proactive retrieval of advertisements, using context prediction, to significantly reduce the bandwidth and energy overheads of advertising, and 2) provides a negotiation protocol and framework that empowers applications to subsidize their data traffic costs by ``bartering'' their advertisement rights for access bandwidth from mobile ISPs. Our evaluation, that uses real mobile advertising data collected from around the globe, demonstrates that CAMEO effectively reduces the resource consumption caused by mobile advertising.},

In the literature, wireless-based indoor positioning for hand-held mobile devices is in meter-level precision, including WLAN (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, and GSM-based approaches. A smartphone-based LBS fusing various sensors, such as accelerometer, digital compass, Wi-Fi, and GPS, can achieve the localization at a better room-level accuracy. In addition, the scanned Wi-Fi access point can determine the room-level identification for a mobile user. However, when multiple human subjects locating in the same coverage area for the same Wi-Fi access points, e.g. in the same room, the individuals often cannot be identified from each other. Therefore, in order to achieve a high precision in a centimeter level for the indoor localization, we extended our head detection scheme of detecting people from depth camera, with an average estimation accuracy of 98.72%, and an average distortion of 2.06 cm. That is, because the compass of a mobile device can provide the orientation of how a human subject holds the mobile device, we proposed to fuse the orientation information analyzed according to the trajectory of a human subject obtained from depth cameras, for enhancing both the indoor localization and people identification accuracies to a centimeter level.},

To address the problem, we present corner extraction by GPS filtering (CEGF) that extracts corner feature GPS points (CFGPs) from GPS track points (GTPs). Applications only need to upload the CFGPs to save the uploading energy on smartphones. CFGPs can be regarded as characteristic points of corners to represent the corresponding roads. To reduce the number of uploaded points, we use CEGF to filter out the CFGPs from a large amount of GTPs.},

 abstract = {Vehicular environments require continuous awareness of the road ahead. It is critical that mobile applications used in such environments (e.g., GPS route planners and location-based search) do not distract drivers from the primary task of operating the vehicle. Fortunately, a large body of research on vehicular interfaces provides best practices that mobile application developers can follow. However, when we studied the most popular vehicular applications in the Android marketplace, no application followed these guidelines. In fact, vehicular applications were not substantially better at meeting best practice guidelines than non-vehicular applications. To remedy this problem, we have developed a tool called AMC that uses model checking to automatically explore the graphical user interface (GUI) of Android applications and detect violations of vehicular design guidelines. AMC is designed to give developers early feedback on their application GUI and reduce the amount of time required by a human expert to assess an application's suitability for vehicular usage. We have evaluated AMC by comparing the violations that it reports with those reported by an industry expert for 12 applications. AMC generated a definitive assessment for 85% of the guidelines checked; for these cases, it had no false positives and a false negative rate of under 2%. For the remaining 15% of cases, AMC reduced the number of application screens that required manual verification by 95%.},

 abstract = {Welcome to MobiSys 2013: The Eleventh International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services. As the premier forum for presenting the latest research in mobile and wireless systems, this year's conference attracted a record number of 211 submissions, a sign of continuing vibrancy and increasing maturity of our community. In addition to the strong technical program covering virtually every major topic of mobile systems research, we've incorporated a new video program showcasing innovative ideas selected from submissions, and have continued the tradition of having an interactive demo and poster fest. The Technical Program Committee and Industrial Reviewer Panel are to be lauded for their extraordinary effort in vetting each paper with care during the rigorous review process. Each paper was assigned to three Program Committee members for a first round of reviews. Each of the 211 papers with at least one positive review (weak accept) was assigned two additional reviewers from the Program Committee in the second round. A paper with potential industrial applications was further assigned to an Industrial Reviewer Committee member. In all, the Program Committee members and industrial reviewers generated 866 reviews and the top 60 papers received at least 5 reviews. The Program Committee met for a full day at Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA. The Committee discussed the top 60 papers and accepted 33 papers for the program. Each of these 33 papers was shepherded by a member of the Program Committee, to ensure that recommendations made by the reviewers and during the Program Committee meeting were satisfactorily addressed. The resulting technical program is the fruit of labor by many. We want to thank all the authors of submitted papers. We are indebted to the Technical Program Committee and Industry Reviewer Panel for their extraordinary work in reviewing papers and providing feedback for the authors, and the Video Program Committee for reviewing and selecting the short videos. We hope you will find the program interesting and thought-provoking, and you will take this opportunity to share your ideas while also networking with other researchers and practitioners from around the world.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose SocioPhone, a novel initiative to build a mobile platform for face-to-face interaction monitoring. Face-to-face interaction, especially conversation, is a fundamental part of everyday life. Interaction-aware applications aimed at facilitating group conversations have been proposed, but have not proliferated yet. Useful contexts to capture and support face-to-face interactions need to be explored more deeply. More important, recognizing delicate conversational contexts with commodity mobile devices requires solving a number of technical challenges. As a first step to address such challenges, we identify useful meta-linguistic contexts of conversation, such as turn-takings, prosodic features, a dominant participant, and pace. These serve as cornerstones for building a variety of interaction-aware applications. SocioPhone abstracts such useful meta-linguistic contexts as a set of intuitive APIs. Its runtime efficiently monitors registered contexts during in-progress conversations and notifies applications on-the-fly. Importantly, we have noticed that online turn monitoring is the basic building block for extracting diverse meta-linguistic contexts, and have devised a novel volume-topography-based method. We show the usefulness of SocioPhone with several interesting applications: SocioTherapist, SocioDigest, and Tug-of-War. Also, we show that our turn-monitoring technique is highly accurate and energy-efficient under diverse real-life situations.},

Compared to smartphone sensors that measure acceleration, light, and other physical properties, MoodScope is a "sensor" that measures the mental state of the user and provides mood as an important input to context-aware computing. We run a formative statistical mood study with smartphone-logged data collected from 32 participants over two months. Through the study, we find that by analyzing communication history and application usage patterns, we can statistically infer a user's daily mood average with an initial accuracy of 66%, which gradu-ally improves to an accuracy of 93% after a two-month personal-ized training period. Motivated by these results, we build a service, MoodScope, which analyzes usage history to act as a sensor of the user's mood. We provide a MoodScope API for developers to use our system to create mood-enabled applications. We further create and deploy a mood-sharing social application.},

Our system uses embedded sensors in smartphones, i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes, to capture differences in centripetal acceleration due to vehicle dynamics. These differences combined with angular speed can determine whether the phone is on the left or right side of the vehicle. Our low infrastructure approach is flexible with different turn sizes and driving speeds. Extensive experiments conducted with two vehicles in two different cities demonstrate that our system is robust to real driving environments. Despite noisy sensor readings from smartphones, our approach can achieve a classification accuracy of over $90\%$ with a false positive rate of a few percent. We also find that by combining sensing results in a few turns, we can achieve better accuracy (e.g., $95\%$) with a lower false positive rate.},

ViRi tries to restore the front-view effect by enhancing the normal content rendering process with an additional geometry correction stage. The necessary prerequisite is effectively and accurately estimating the actual viewing angle under natural viewing situations and under the constraints of the device's computational power and limited battery deposit. We tackle the problem with face detection and augment the phone camera with a fisheye lens to expand its field of view so that the device can recognize its user even the phone is placed casually. We propose effective pre-processing techniques to ensure the applicability of face detection tools onto highly distorted fisheye images. To save energy, we leverage information from system states, employ multiple low power sensors to rule out unlikely viewing situations, and aggressively seek additional opportunities to maximally skip the face detection. For situations in which face detection is unavoidable, we design efficient prediction techniques to further speed up the face detection. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques have been confirmed through thorough evaluations. We have also built a straw man application to allow users to experience the intriguing effects of ViRi.},

 abstract = {Welcome to MobiSys 2014, the 12th Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services. This year's technical program covers a wide range of topics in mobile systems. The program both deepens our understanding of several long-standing problems and explores an expanding set of emerging mobile applications and technologies. Topics include automated user-interface exploration, efficient resource usage, gesture recognition, localization, privacy and security, wearable computing, wireless networks, and more. We are thrilled to begin the technical program with a keynote talk by Professor James Landay of Cornell NYC Tech. Dr. Landay has been a leading researcher on human-computer interaction and ubiquitous computing for over twenty years. After the keynote, we have an exciting technical program that includes 25 full-length technical papers chosen by the technical program committee (TPC) from 185 submissions. As interest in the conference has grown over the last several years, so too has the review load for MobiSys TPCs. To reduce the number of reviews each TPC member had to write, we augmented the TPC with an external review committee (ERC) of experts. Most ERC members reviewed six papers during the initial round of the review process. Our review process consisted of three rounds of decisions. During the first round, all submissions received three or four reviews, each written by a member of the TPC or ERC. If a reviewer recommended that a paper be accepted, the paper advanced to the second round. During the second round, papers received three or four additional reviews, almost entirely from the TPC. At the end of the second round, reviewers discussed each remaining paper online to determine whether it should advance to the third round of decisions. The third round of decisions occurred during an all-day face-to-face meeting of the TPC. By the conclusion of this meeting, the TPC had identified the 25 papers in the program. Finally, all accepted papers were shepherded by a TPC member to ensure that the final manuscripts met the standards of the committee. We took strict precautions throughout the review process to avoid conflicts of interest. Furthermore, as the TPC chairs, we did not submit papers to avoid conflicts of interest.},

 abstract = {In many mobile wireless applications such as the automated driving of cars, formation flying of unmanned air vehicles, and source localization or target tracking with wireless sensor networks, it is more important to know the precise relative locations of nodes than their absolute coordinates. GPS, the most ubiquitous localization system available, generally provides only absolute coordinates. Furthermore, low-cost receivers can exhibit tens of meters of error or worse in challenging RF environments. This video demonstration presents an approach that uses GPS to derive relative location information for multiple receivers. Cooperating nodes in a network share their raw satellite measurements and use this data to track the relative motions of neighboring nodes as opposed to computing their own absolute coordinates. This is achieved via creation of a new error model that incorporates GPS localization errors specific to the multiple-receiver case, development of a new, highly accurate observation model that allows for the change in range between a single satellite and two receivers to be mapped through time, and the synthesis of these two models into a novel 3D pairwise tracking algorithm that uses the local GPS node as its own reference and requires only an approximate estimate of its own absolute position to achieve centimeter-scale relative tracking precision. The system just described was implemented on a network of Android smartphones equipped with a Bluetooth-enabled, custom GPS node to provide raw measurement data. Several experiments were carried out to test our proof of concept in various GPS environments and under different types of dynamic conditions. Our evaluation shows that centimeter-scale tracking accuracy at an update rate of 1 Hz is possible under various conditions with the presented technique. This is more than an order of magnitude more accurate than simply taking the difference of reported absolute node coordinates or other simplistic approaches due to uncorrelated measurement errors. The demo shown in this video represents one of the high-dynamic test cases in which we placed a stationary GPS receiver on a tripod in the middle of a parking lot and three additional nodes on top of an automobile. We proceeded to drive the automobile through various environments, including a multipath-rich alleyway, moderately benign suburban roads, and at high speeds on an interstate highway. The total length of the experiment was 15 minutes, spanning 12.2 km of terrain, with the baseline vector between the stationary node in the parking lot and the roving nodes on the automobile ranging from 0 to 3.5 km at any given time. The visualization of the experimental results is taken from the point of view of the stationary node, enabling us to map the relative tracks of the roving nodes in an absolute coordinate space using Google Earth. The results of this experiment showed centimeter-scale tracking accuracy - a level of precision that enables clear distinction of driving features such as lane shifts and velocity changes - under various driving conditions, with only one problematic loss of satellite locks due to signal obstruction by a wide overpass while the vehicle was changing directions. This momentary loss of lock caused the tracking algorithm to resume after approximately 2 meters of error had already been accrued, and this error remained present and constant throughout the remainder of the experiment. Future work involves solving for initialization and re-calibration of the tracking algorithm on the fly, such that losses of lock and visibility obstructions do not degrade the accuracy of the system in the long run. In its present form, RegTrack already provides an order of magnitude better precision than complementary methods using low-cost, single-frequency commercial receivers, and the stage is set for further research to increase its robustness and utility for high-precision, low-cost applications.},

 abstract = {Scooters are commonly used in many countries due to their low sale price, better fuel economy, and the ability to easily navigate through heavy traffic congestions. Today in Taiwan, approximately 70% of the registered vehicles are scooters. However, due to the low cost nature of the scooters, many safety technologies developed for cars cannot be adopted by them; statistics show that accidents involving scooters contribute to more than 80% of fatalities in traffic accidents in Taiwan, resulting in more than 2,000 deaths annually. It is therefore crucial to develop a new low-cost safety system that can be used by scooters. The enabling concept in this new safety system is cooperation between vehicles: scooters and cars sharing their current status and their observation of the neighboring environment via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. However, how to implement this cost efficiently remains an open issue. Visible Light Communications (VLC) uses modulated visible light sources, i.e., changing the intensity of the light sent by the source, to transmit digital information, and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are usually used as the transmission source. As LEDs become commonly used in automotive lighting, VLC appears as an attractive and cost-effective solution to implement V2V communications [1,2]: no extra cost is needed for the main transmission component and the additional processing circuits have very low complexity.},

 abstract = {Mobile app ecosystems have experienced tremendous growth in the last five years. As researchers and developers turn their attention to understanding the ecosystem and its different apps, instrumentation of mobile apps is a much needed emerging capability. In this paper, we explore a selective instrumentation capability that allows users to express instrumentation specifications at a high level of abstraction; these specifications are then used to automatically insert instrumentation into binaries. The challenge in our work is to develop expressive abstractions for instrumentation that can also be implemented efficiently. Designed using requirements derived from recent research that has used instrumented apps, our selective instrumentation framework, SIF, contains abstractions that allow users to compactly express precisely which parts of the app need to be instrumented. It also contains a novel path inspection capability, and provides users feedback on the approximate overhead of the instrumentation specification. Using experiments on our SIF implementation for Android, we show that SIF can be used to compactly (in 20-30 lines of code in most cases) specify instrumentation tasks previously reported in the literature. SIF's overhead is under 2% in most cases, and its instrumentation overhead feedback is within 15% in many cases. As such, we expect that SIF can accelerate studies of the mobile app ecosystem.},

 abstract = {Users routinely access cloud services through third-party apps on smartphones by giving apps login credentials (i.e., a username and password). Unfortunately, users have no assurance that their apps will properly handle this sensitive information. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ScreenPass, which significantly improves the security of passwords on touchscreen devices. ScreenPass secures passwords by ensuring that they are entered securely, and uses taint-tracking to monitor where apps send password data. The primary technical challenge addressed by ScreenPass is guaranteeing that trusted code is always aware of when a user is entering a password. ScreenPass provides this guarantee through two techniques. First, ScreenPass includes a trusted software keyboard that encourages users to specify their passwords' domains as they are entered (i.e., to tag their passwords). Second, ScreenPass performs optical character recognition (OCR) on a device's screenbuffer to ensure that passwords are entered only through the trusted software keyboard. We have evaluated ScreenPass through experiments with a prototype implementation, two in-situ user studies, and a small app study. Our prototype detected a wide range of dynamic and static keyboard-spoofing attacks and generated zero false positives. As long as a screen is off, not updated, or not tapped, our prototype consumes zero additional energy; in the worst case, when a highly interactive app rapidly updates the screen, our prototype under a typical configuration introduces only 12% energy overhead. Participants in our user studies tagged their passwords at a high rate and reported that tagging imposed no additional burden. Finally, a study of malicious and non-malicious apps running under ScreenPass revealed several cases of password mishandling.},

 abstract = {This paper presents SmartSynth, a novel end-to-end programming system for synthesizing smartphone automation scripts from natural language descriptions. Our approach is unique in two key aspects. First, it involves a carefully designed domain-specific language that incorporates standard constructs from smartphone programming platforms to balance its expressivity and the ability to synthesize scripts from natural language. Second, our synthesis algorithm integrates techniques from two research areas: (1) It infers the set of components and their partial dataflow relations from the natural language description using techniques from the Natural Language Processing community; and (2) It uses techniques from the Program Synthesis community to infer missing dataflow relations via type-based synthesis and constructs scripts in a process akin to reverse parsing. SmartSynth also performs conversational interactions with the user when multiple top-ranked scripts exist or it cannot map part of the description to any component. Evaluated on 50 tasks collected from smartphone help forums, our system produces the intended scripts in real time for over 90% of the 640 natural language descriptions obtained from a user study for those tasks. SmartSynth has also been adapted to TouchDevelop, an end user-targeted programming environment on mobile platforms, with very promising results (see http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~su/smartsynth.mp4 for a video demo). We believe that SmartSynth is a step toward fully personalized use of smartphones' increasingly rich functionalities.},

 abstract = {Cellular networks have revolutionized the way people communicate in rural areas. At the same time, deployment of commercial-grade cellular networks in areas with low population density, such as in rural sub-Saharan Africa, is prohibitively expensive relative to the return of investment. As a result, 48\% of the rural population in Africa remains disconnected. To address this problem, we design a local cellular network architecture, Kwiizya, that provides basic voice and text messaging services in rural areas. Our system features an interface for development of text message based applications that can be leveraged for improved health care, education and support of local businesses. We deployed an instance of Kwiizya in the rural village of Macha in Zambia. Our deployment utilizes the existing long distance Wi-Fi network in the village for inter-base station communication to provide high quality services with minimal infrastructure requirements. In this paper we evaluate Kwiizya in-situ in Macha and show that the network maintains low delay and jitter (20ms and 3ms, respectively) for voice call traffic, while providing high call Mean Opinion Score of 3.46, which is the theoretical maximum supported by our system.},

 abstract = {A hurdle to frequently performing mobile computer vision tasks is the high energy cost of image sensing. In particular, modern image sensors are not energy proportional; for low resolution and low frame rate capture, the image sensor consumes almost the same amount of energy as it does at high resolutions and high frame rates. We reveal two system-level energy proportional mechanisms: (i) using an optimal pixel clock frequency; (ii) entering low power standby mode between frames. These techniques can be implemented by the image sensor driver with minimal hardware adjustment. Further improvements can be made by designing sensors with heterogeneous hardware architectures. With energy proportionality, computer vision frameworks can be optimized for power consumption, continuously requesting low resolution frames with low energy while only occasionally using high energy to request high resolution frames. This will in turn enable low power continuous mobile vision applications.},

 abstract = {The proliferation of sensors on mobile phones and wearables has led to a plethora of context classifiers designed to sense the individual's context. We argue that a key missing piece in mobile inference is a layer that fuses the outputs of several classifiers to learn deeper insights into an individual's habitual patterns and associated correlations between contexts, thereby enabling new systems optimizations and opportunities. In this paper, we design CQue, a dynamic bayesian network that operates over classifiers for individual contexts, observes relations across these outputs across time, and identifies opportunities for improving energy-efficiency and accuracy by taking advantage of relations. In addition, such a layer provides insights into privacy leakage that might occur when seemingly innocuous user context revealed to different applications on a phone may be combined to reveal more information than originally intended. In terms of system architecture, our key contribution is a clean separation between the detection layer and the fusion layer, enabling classifiers to solely focus on detecting the context, and leverage temporal smoothing and fusion mechanisms to further boost performance by just connecting to our higher-level inference engine. To applications and users, CQue provides a query interface, allowing a) applications to obtain more accurate context results while remaining agnostic of what classifiers/sensors are used and when, and b) users to specify what contexts they wish to keep private, and only allow information that has low leakage with the private context to be revealed. We implemented CQue in Android, and our results show that CQue can i) improve activity classification accuracy up to 42%, ii) reduce energy consumption in classifying social, location and activity contexts with high accuracy(>90%) by reducing the number of required classifiers by at least 33%, and iii) effectively detect and suppress contexts that reveal private information.},

In this paper, we propose Spartacus, a mobile system that enables spatially-aware neighboring device interactions with zero prior configuration. Using built-in microphones and speakers on commodity mobile devices, Spartacus uses a novel acoustic technique based on the Doppler effect to enable users to accurately initiate an interaction with a neighboring device through a pointing gesture. To enable truly spontaneous interactions on energy-constrained mobile devices, Spartacus uses a continuous audio-based lower-power listening mechanism to trigger the gesture detection service. This eliminates the need for any manual action by the user. Experimental results show that Spartacus achieves an average 90% device selection accuracy within 3m for most interaction scenarios. Our energy consumption evaluations show that, Spartacus achieves about 4X lower energy consumption than WiFi Direct and 5.5X lower than the latest Bluetooth 4.0 protocols.},

 abstract = {In many mobile wireless applications such as the automated driving of cars, formation flying of unmanned air vehicles, and source localization or target tracking with wireless sensor networks, it is more important to know the precise relative locations of nodes than their absolute coordinates. GPS, the most ubiquitous localization system available, generally provides only absolute coordinates. Furthermore, low-cost receivers can exhibit tens of meters of error or worse in challenging RF environments. This paper presents an approach that uses GPS to derive relative location information for multiple receivers. Nodes in a network share their raw satellite measurements and use this data to track the relative motions of neighboring nodes as opposed to computing their own absolute coordinates. The system has been implemented using a network of Android phones equipped with a custom Bluetooth headset and integrated GPS chip to provide raw measurement data. Our evaluation shows that centimeter-scale tracking accuracy at an update rate of 1 Hz is possible under various conditions with the presented technique. This is more than an order of magnitude more accurate than simply taking the difference of reported absolute node coordinates or other simplistic approaches due to the presence of uncorrelated measurement errors.},

 abstract = {We present CarSafe, a new driver safety app for Android phones that detects and alerts drivers to dangerous driving conditions and behavior. It uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms on the phone to monitor and detect whether the driver is tired or distracted using the front-facing camera while at the same time tracking road conditions using the rear-facing camera. Today's smartphones do not, however, have the capability to process video streams from both the front and rear cameras simultaneously. In response, CarSafe uses acontext-aware algorithm that switches between the two cameras while processing the data in real-time with the goal of minimizing missed events inside (e.g., drowsy driving) and outside of the car (e.g., tailgating). Camera switching means that CarSafe technically has a "blind spot" in the front or rear at any given time. To address this, CarSafe uses other embedded sensors on the phone (i.e., inertial sensors) to generate soft hints regarding potential blind spot dangers. We present the design and implementation of CarSafe and discuss its evaluation using results from a 12-driver field trial. Results from the CarSafe deployment are promising -- CarSafe can infer a common set of dangerous driving behaviors and road conditions with an overall precision and recall of 83% and 75%, respectively. CarSafe is the first dual-camera sensing app for smartphones and represents a new disruptive technology because it provides similar advanced safety features otherwise only found in expensive top-end cars.},

Auditeur is backed by a cloud service to store user contributed sound clips and to generate an energy-efficient and context-aware classification plan for the phone. When an acoustic event type has been registered, the smartphone instantiates the necessary acoustic processing modules and wires them together to execute the plan. The phone then captures, processes, and classifies acoustic events locally and efficiently. Our analysis on user-contributed empirical data shows that Auditeur's energy-aware acoustic feature selection algorithm is capable of increasing the device lifetime by 33.4%, sacrificing less than 2% of the maximum achievable accuracy. We implement seven apps with Auditeur, and deploy them in real-world scenarios to demonstrate that Auditeur is versatile, 11.04% - 441.42% less power hungry, and 10.71% - 13.86% more accurate in detecting acoustic events, compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

 abstract = {Real-time communication (RTC) applications such as VoIP, video conferencing, and online gaming are flourishing. To adapt and deliver good performance, these applications require accurate estimations of short-term network performance metrics, e.g., loss rate, one-way delay, and throughput. However, the wide variation in mobile cellular network performance makes running RTC applications on these networks problematic. To address this issue, various performance adaptation techniques have been proposed, but one common problem of such techniques is that they only adjust application behavior reactively after performance degradation is visible. Thus, proactive adaptation based on accurate short-term, fine-grained network performance prediction can be a preferred alternative that benefits RTC applications. In this study, we show that forecasting the short-term performance in cellular networks is possible in part due to the channel estimation scheme on the device and the radio resource scheduling algorithm at the base station. We develop a system interface called PROTEUS, which passively collects current network performance, such as throughput, loss, and one-way delay, and then uses regression trees to forecast future network performance. PROTEUS successfully predicts the occurrence of packet loss within a 0.5s time window for 98% of the time windows and the occurrence of long one-way delay for 97% of the time windows. We also demonstrate how PROTEUS can be integrated with RTC applications to significantly improve the perceptual quality. In particular, we increase the peak signal-to-noise ratio of a video conferencing application by up to 15dB and reduce the perceptual delay in a gaming application by up to 4s.},

Each of the 155 papers with at least one review of "weak reject" was assigned an additional reviewer from the Program Committee in the second round. In the final round, we assigned an additional pair of reviewers or more to each of the top 88 papers. In all the Program Committee members and external reviewers generated 724 reviews and the top 88 papers received at least 5 reviews. The Program Committee met for a full day at La Jolla, CA. The Committee discussed the top 60 papers and accepted 32 papers for the program. The 32 paper count is another record high for MobiSys and shows that there is a great deal of high quality work coming from our community. Each of these 32 papers was shepherded by a member of the Program Committee to help ensure that recommendations made by the reviewers and during the Program Committee meeting were addressed. There were several new additions to the review process. First, we created an External Review Panel composed of people active in the mobile computing industry. In addition to getting the valuable opinions of these experts, a secondary goal of the panel was to increase the interaction between these industry leaders and the MobiSys community. Second, we had the Program Committee generate a single public review for each accepted paper. The public review highlights the key contributions of the paper that convinced the Program Committee to accept the paper and some of the remaining weaknesses in the paper. These public reviews were posted on an online forum (http://reviews.mobisys2012.rice.edu/) to help promote community discussion on each paper.},

 abstract = {Compute intensive games currently represent the class of most popular and at the same time most power consuming applications on mobile phones. To reduce the power consumption of games we have developed a game state specific power management technique. Games typically consist of several states such as the game loading, main menu, in-game menu and gaming state. Each of these states has its specific processing requirements, e.g., the game loading state is likely to be memory bound and menu scenes are less interactive than gaming states and hence do not require high frame rates to satisfy the user's perception. Our game state specific governor (i) recognizes these game states by intercepting and analyzing calls made by the game application to the graphics library, and (ii) exploits these state-specific characteristics to enable power management strategies targeted to these individual states at runtime. Thereby, we achieve significant power savings of up to 50.8% compared to Android's default interactive governor.},

Smartphone users are frustrated by applications consuming too much power. To avoid this experience, they may have to profile energy consumption on the phone. However, it is difficult for a user to analyze energy consumption of his phone because the process requires deep understanding of the interaction between the hardware and software. Therefore, market curators need to examine applications for providing power consumption data before accepting them into App market. Unfortunately, current App markets mainly employ basic functional tests and checking policy on the submitted applications. Moreover, considering the exponentially increasing daily amount of new Apps posted on the App market, it is not feasible to perform the process manually. Therefore, if we can provide an automated energy estimation tool for App market curators, users can have energy consumption data in addition to the current functional description. In this poster, we propose a framework for automated power estimation of android apps.},

 abstract = {Using smartphones for accurate indoor localization opens a new frontier of mobile services, offering enormous opportunities to enhance users' experiences in indoor environments. Despite significant efforts on indoor localization in both academia and industry in the past two decades, highly accurate and practical smartphone-based indoor localization remains an open problem. To enable indoor location-based services (ILBS), there are several stringent requirements for an indoor localization system: highly accurate that can differentiate massive users' locations (foot-level); no additional hardware components or extensions on users' smartphones; scalable to massive concurrent users. Current GPS, Radio RSS (e.g. WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee), or Fingerprinting based solutions can only achieve meter-level or room-level accuracy. In this paper, we propose a practical and accurate solution that fills the long-lasting gap of smartphone-based indoor localization. Specifically, we design and implement an indoor localization ecosystem Guoguo. Guoguo consists of an anchor network with a coordination protocol to transmit modulated localization beacons using high-band acoustic signals, a realtime processing app in a smartphone, and a backend server for indoor contexts and location-based services. We further propose approaches to improve its coverage, accuracy, and location update rate with low-power consumption. Our prototype shows centimeter-level localization accuracy in an office and classroom environment. Such precise indoor localization is expected to have high impact in the future ILBS and our daily activities.},

 abstract = {Recent popularity of smartphones drives rapid growth in the demand for cellular network bandwidth. Unfortunately, due to the centralized architecture of cellular networks, increasing the physical backhaul bandwidth is challenging. While content caching in the cellular network could be beneficial, relatively few characteristics of the cellular traffic is known to come up with a highly-effetive caching strategy. In this work, we provide insight into flow and content-level characteristics of modern 3G traffic at a large cellular ISP in South Korea. We first develop a scalable deep flow inspection (DFI) system that can manage hundreds of thousands of concurrent TCP flows on a commodity multicore server. Our DFI system collects various HTTP/TCP-level statistics and produces logs for analyzing the effectiveness of conventional Web caching, prefix-based Web caching, and TCP-level redundancy elimination (RE) without a single packet drop at a 10~Gbps link. Our week-long measurements of over 370 TBs of the 3G traffic reveal that standard Web caching can reduce download bandwidth consumption up to 27.1% while simple TCP-level RE can save the bandwidth consumption up to 42.0% with a cache of 512~GB of RAM. We also find that applying TCP-level RE on the largest 9.4% flows eliminates 68.4% of the total redundancy. Most of the redundancy (52.1%~58.9%) comes from serving the same HTTP objects while the contribution by aliased URLs is up to 38.9%.},

@inproceedings{Nekrasov:2013:ITC:2462456.2465720,
 abstract = {This poster outlines ongoing work using mobile devices for communication and computation for environmental sensor networks in Thailand. This work is funded by a Fulbright scholarship spanning January to September 2013. The work is a partnership between the Center of Excellence for Ecoinformatics at Walailak University, the University of California Santa Barbara, and the University of California San Diego. It brings computer scientists and biologists together for the development of technology aimed at studying Thailand's costal ecosystems. Bandon Bay, Surathani province, is home to mussel, cockle, oyster, and shrimp farmers. In March 2011, severe rainfall in the southern region of Thailand caused an influx of freshwater and sediment into the bay. Cockle and oysters were suffocated by a thick layer of sediment. The surge of water forced shrimp out into the open ocean. As a result, the aquaculture industry suffered immensely, with losses upwards of eight hundred million Baht. The aim of this project is to provide a valuable service to the region by giving farmers and locals a resource for assessing the water quality in Bandon Bay, as well as providing a warning system against possibly treacherous environmental patterns. The system utilizes a Galaxy Nexus Android phone for real-time data collection and processing. The data is streamed to an Amazon EC2 server where it undergoes event-detection and archived for later study by ecologists. The system is deployed in the Gulf of Thailand, one mile off the coast. For power, the system uses a 40W solar panel. The data is transmitted using the phone's built in cellular modem. The system utilizes a SparkFun Electronics IOIO for interfacing to external sensors and power. The phone currently interfaces with a Vaisala WXT 520 meteorological station, with plans to extend the sensor suite to include water sensors for conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH. The environmental conditions in the bay require a low power device that is capable of wireless communication. While there are industry devices capable of this, like the Campbell Scientific sensor suites, they are prohibitively expensive for developing nations and are heavily proprietary, impeding expansion and development. In contrast, a mobile device running open source software is a perfect candidate, as it is inherently capable of cellular communication, has a backup battery for intermittent power loss, and has the computing power necessary for data ingestion and onboard processing from a multitude of meteorological and aquatic sensors. The system utilizes the Open Source Data Turbine streaming middleware [1] for real-time buffered data streaming and visualization. It builds upon the SensorPod [2] software stack developed at UCSD for interfacing with environmental sensors. For event detection, the system utilizes Esper for complex event processing. The mobile device collects and streams the data, which is captured by the cloud server and is run through a real-time event detection engine. Both the original data and the derived analysis are then made publically accessible and mirrored to universities in Thailand in real-time, using the DataTurbine middleware. Interested parties can visualize both the data and the derived analysis in real-time. In the event of connectivity interruptions, the mobile device buffers the data and retransmits when a connection is re-established. Currently, the system is deployed in the bay, and we are in the process of writing the event detection logic. Once the system is determined to be stable, we will add water sensors necessary for flood detection. We are investigating transitioning some of the event detection logic onto the mobile device itself, but we are hesitant to use the Android compatible version of Esper, as it does not have ongoing support. If this project proves successful, we are considering mirroring the technology for use in coral observation and detection of coral bleaching.},

 abstract = {In Taiwan, because of the Doppler effects and tunnel shading, it is difficult to smoothly receive a live DVB-T channel inside a high-speed train by a laptop equipped with an ordinary DVB-T USB dongle. For providing live TV services inside a high-speed train, we develop a mobile live TV system for Taiwan High-speed Rail (THSR). The proposed system delivers live TV programs to a high-speed train through the mobile WiMAX network deployed along the THSR railway by the WiMAX operator VeeTime. Then, the received live TV programs are delivered to the terminal devices of high-speed rail passengers through Wi-Fi multicast. Using Wi-Fi multicast inside a high-speed train is necessary since there may be several hundreds of concurrent users on the same high-speed train. However, conventionally to provide a scalable Wi-Fi multicast streaming system is difficult because no extra reliability control mechanisms such as ARQ (Automatic Repeat-reQuest) are available for Wi-Fi multicast. Instead we overcome the difficulty of scalable Wi-Fi multicast streaming by using AL-FEC (Application Layer -- Forward Error Correction). Hence, in the demo session of MobiSys 2013, we plan to show the whole mobile live TV system with a live TV input, especially focused on its capability of scalable Wi-Fi multicast streaming over a multi-hop Wi-Fi network that can emulate the real multi-hop Wi-Fi network inside a high-speed train.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of how to recognize a new human activity when we have never seen any training example of that activity before. Recognizing human activities is an essential element for user-centric and context-aware applications. Previous studies showed promising results using various machine learning algorithms. However, most existing methods can only recognize the activities that were previously seen in the training data. A previously unseen activity class cannot be recognized if there were no training samples in the dataset. Even if all of the activities can be enumerated in advance, labeled samples are often time consuming and expensive to get, as they require huge effort from human annotators or experts. In this paper, we present NuActiv, an activity recognition system that can recognize a human activity even when there are no training data for that activity class. Firstly, we designed a new representation of activities using semantic attributes, where each attribute is a human readable term that describes a basic element or an inherent characteristic of an activity. Secondly, based on this representation, a two-layer zero-shot learning algorithm is developed for activity recognition. Finally, to reinforce recognition accuracy using minimal user feedback, we developed an active learning algorithm for activity recognition. Our approach is evaluated on two datasets, including a 10-exercise-activity dataset we collected, and a public dataset of 34 daily life activities. Experimental results show that using semantic attribute-based learning, NuActiv can generalize knowledge to recognize unseen new activities. Our approach achieved up to 79% accuracy in unseen activity recognition.},

 abstract = {Error correction is a fundamental problem in wireless system design as wireless links often suffer high bit error rate due to the effects of signal attenuation, multipath fading and interference. This paper presents a new cross-layer solution called LEAD to improve the performance of existing channel decoders. While the traditional wisdom of cross-layer design is to exploit physical layer information at upper-layers, LEAD represents a paradigm shift in that it leverages upper-layer protocol signatures to improve the performance of physical layer channel decoding. The approach of LEAD is motivated by two key insights. First, channel codes can correct more errors when the values of some bits, which we refer to as {\em pilots}, are known before decoding. Second, some header fields of upper-layer protocols are often fixed or highly biased toward certain values. These distinctive bit pattern signatures can thus be exploited as pilots to assist channel decoding. To realize this idea, we first characterize bit bias in real-life network traffic, and develop an efficient algorithm to extract pilot bits with assured prediction accuracy. We then propose a decoding framework to allow existing channel decoders to effectively exploit extracted pilots. We implement LEAD on GNURadio/USRP platform and evaluate its performance by replaying real-life packet traces on a testbed of 12 USRP links. Our results show that LEAD significantly improve wireless link performance, while incurring very low overhead. Specifically, LEAD reduces more than 90\% bit errors for 48.9\% packets, and improves the end-to-end link throughput by 1.43x to 1.93x over existing error correction schemes.},

While NFC is radically changing how we pay for merchandise, it opens a pandora's box of ways in which it may be misused by unscrupulous individuals. This could include malicious NFC tags that seek to compromise a mobile phone, malicious readers that try to generate fake mobile payment transactions or steal valuable financial information, and others. In this work, we look at how to protect mobile phones from these threats while not being vulnerable to them. We design a small form-factor "patch", EnGarde, that can be stuck on the back of a phone to provide the capability to jam malicious interactions. EnGarde is entirely passive and harvests power through the same NFC source that it guards, which makes our hardware design minimalist, and facilitates eventual integration with a phone. We tackle key technical challenges in this design including operating across a range of NFC protocols, jamming at extremely low power, harvesting sufficient power for perpetual operation while having minimal impact on the phone's battery, designing an intelligent jammer that blocks only when specific blacklisted behavior is detected, and importantly, the ability to do all this without compromising user experience when the phone interacts with a legitimate external NFC device.},

Existing techniques either employ cumbersome fingerprinting, or rely upon the deployment of additional infrastructure. Towards a solution that is easier to adopt, we propose CUPID, which is free from these restrictions, yet is comparable in accuracy. While existing WiFi based solutions are highly susceptible to indoor multipath, CUPID utilizes physical layer (PHY) information to extract the signal strength and the angle of only the direct path, successfully avoiding the effect of multipath reflections. Our main observation is that natural human mobility, when combined with PHY layer information, can help in accurately estimating the angle and distance of a mobile device from an wireless access point (AP). Real-world indoor experiments using off-the-shelf wireless chipsets confirm the feasibility of CUPID. In addition, while previous approaches rely on multiple APs, CUPID is able to localize a device when only a single AP is present. When a few more APs are available, CUPID can improve the median localization error to 2.7m, which is comparable to schemes that rely on expensive fingerprinting or additional infrastructure.},

 abstract = {Digital road maps have become essential to many aspects of our lives. Unfortunately, they have persistent quality issues, both in developing countries as well as in developed countries, evidenced by the recent Apple-Google map war. A survey of British drivers showed 26% have been directed by their GPS to go into no-entry areas, and the news periodically reports car accidents caused by or related to digital maps. In addition to correcting existing errors, maps need to be frequently updated to reflect the latest constructions, closures, and reconfigurations. TomTom estimates that roads change by as much as 15% each year. There are also growing demands for other types of maps, including off-road driving, cycling, hiking, and skiing maps. There are services for people to share GPS traces, but none creates navigable maps. Getting maps up to date and maintaining them involves a great deal of effort and delay. Today's maps are built by expensive geological surveys, supplemented by manual editing work from aerial imagery or corrections submitted by aggravated map users. NavTeq (now Nokia) employs more than 7,000 employees worldwide in its Location Content team to update maps. We present the CrowdAtlas system, which updates digital maps using the increasingly abundant GPS traces available as byproducts from a variety of sources: fleet management systems, telematics systems, and smartphone apps (e.g., navigation and location based services). We modified state-of-the-art map matching algorithms to accommodate the possibility that the existing map is incomplete. It uses the traces that match the map to monitor for road closures and fix road geometry. It uses tight clusters of trace segments from many vehicles that do not match the map in order to infer missing roads that connect to existing roads. The existing roads provide good segmentation of the traces to produce high quality clusters, enabling the automated (and even unsupervised) addition of missing roads. Using one week of traces from 70 taxis in Beijing, CrowdAtlas inferred 61km of new roads, which we uploaded to OpenStreetMap and became its first set of computer generated roads. To enable personalized maps, we also developed CrowdAtlas app based on OSMAnd, an open source navigation app. When acting as a GPS data source to CrowdAtlas server, it contributes data better optimized for map update with less communication. When acting in standalone-mode, it can add missing roads to its onboard navigation map. Instead of aggregating multiple GPS traces for high confidence, this app can add each new road immediately after the user traverses it, given user confirmation. We used our CrowdAtlas app in standalone-mode to map out major roads in a 4.5km^2 area of Shanghai Pudong in less than 30 minutes and build the walking map of the SJTU campus in less than a day. CrowdAtlas could fundamentally change the way people create and update maps. Together with incubating technologies that extract road metadata from street views and aerial imagery, modern cartography could be revolutionized, reducing or eliminating the expensive and slow manual mapping process used today. The high-definition version of our video presentation is available at vimeo.com/62912005, and our accompanying full-length paper describes the technical details of CrowdAtlas.},

 abstract = {Malicious activities involving Android applications are rising rapidly. As prior work on cyber-crimes suggests, we need to understand the economic incentives of the criminals to design the most effective defenses. In this paper, we investigate application plagiarism on Android markets at a large scale. We take the first step to characterize plagiarized applications and estimate their impact on the original application developers. We first crawled 265,359 free applications from 17 Android markets around the world and ran a tool to identify similar applications ("clones"). Based on the data, we examined properties of the cloned applications, including their distribution across different markets, application categories, and ad libraries. Next, we examined how cloned applications affect the original developers. We captured HTTP advertising traffic generated by mobile applications at a tier-1 US cellular carrier for 12 days. To associate each Android application with its advertising traffic, we extracted a unique advertising identifier (called the client ID) from both the applications and the network traces. We estimate a lower bound on the advertising revenue that cloned applications siphon from the original developers, and the user base that cloned applications divert from the original applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large scale study on the characteristics of cloned mobile applications and their impact on the original developers.},

@inproceedings{Le:2013:KPT:2462456.2465729,
 abstract = {This video demo features a new keyword programming environment for TouchDevelop, a popular touch-centric system for scripting mobile devices. The new environment allows users to simply enter a set of keywords, and its internal program synthesis engine automatically generates script snippets that most likely reflect the users' intent. Because the synthesis engine can be triggered anywhere in a script, it also exploits various contextual information, such as which variables/functions are in-scope, to guide the generation of snippets. Our new environment benefit both novice and experienced TouchDevelop users. It helps novice users to synthesize script snippets from keywords and explore unfamiliar TouchDevelop features. It also improves experienced users' productivity because they need to worry about fewer coding details and enter less code. The demoed feature has been released and deployed since TouchDevelop version 2.10.},

@inproceedings{Davis:2013:RRA:2462456.2464462,
 abstract = {An obvious asset of the Android platform is the tremendous number and variety of available apps. There is a less obvious, but potentially even more important, benefit to the fact that nearly all apps are developed using a common platform. We can leverage the relatively uniform nature of Android apps to allow users to tweak applications for improved security, usability, and functionality with relative ease (compared to desktop applications). We design and implement an Android app rewriting framework for customizing behavior of existing applications without requiring source code or app-specific guidance. Following app-agnostic transformation policies, our system rewrites applications to insert, remove, or modify behavior. The rewritten application can run on any unmodified Android device, without requiring rooting or other custom software. This paper describes RetroSkeleton, our app rewriting framework, including static and dynamic interception of method invocations, and creating policies that integrate with each target app. We show that our system is capable of supporting a variety of useful policies, including providing flexible fine-grained network access control, building HTTPS-Everywhere functionality into apps, implementing automatic app localization, informing users of hidden behavior in apps, and updating apps depending on outdated APIs. We evaluate these policies by rewriting and testing more than one thousand real-world apps from Google Play.},
