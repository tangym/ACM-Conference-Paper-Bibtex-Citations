 abstract = {Wireless charging for power transfer, similarly to wireless communications for information transfer, rely on the electromagnetic (EM) field propagation on air.We design a system that supports simultaneous power transfer and information transfer. However, in contrast to other prior work that uses communication signals for power transfer, we treat power transfer as the primary function (yielding much higher power efficiency) and build communications on the inductive-coupling-based charging signal. Our prototype design is comparable to Qi standard, operating at the frequency of 155kHz with input voltage of 7V and current of 1.5A. For communications, we use frequency shift keying (FSK) of the AC current signal to transfer information from the transmitter to the receiver; for reverse-direction communication, we employ amplitude-modulation-based backscattering. Our design consumes no power at the receiver (the object of the power transfer)and requires minimal hardware (since we modulate data on the charging signals).},

This demo presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of ReCon: a cross-platform (iOS, Android, Windows) system that reveals PII leaks and gives users control over them without requiring any special privileges or custom OSes. ReCon, which has been accepted as a paper to the Mobisys conference, leverages machine learning to reveal potential PII leaks by inspecting network traffic, and provides a visualization tool to empower users with the ability to control these leaks via blocking or substitution of PII. For this demo, we will show how ReCon detects PII in real time, allows users to provide feedback on detected PII, and provides users with controls for blocking or modifying PII leaks. The system is publicly available and we will also help any interested users install it on their mobile devices.},

At the same time, sensitive information in the physical environment can inadvertently leak through image data shared with applications. Preventing leaks by a determined attacker is likely impossible, but as camera-based applications become more central to our work and personal lives, it is imperative to develop tools that provide greater control over what information applications can access through cameras. We have designed and implemented two systems, PrivateEye and WaveOff, that use privacy markers to provide fine-grained access control of information within a camera's view. Our demonstration highlights the accuracy, performance, and usability of these systems.},

While efficient engine and vehicle design can achieve substantial fuel savings, further fuel savings as high as 20% can be gained by adopting efficient driving behavior.

We propose a methodology to enhance fuel economy of fleet vehicles via real-time driver behavior monitoring and feedback. We propose to collect data and provide feedback through mobile devices to enhance its usability, flexibility, and reduce costs. The feedback will be based on an individual driver profile and other real-time data such as route information, weather and traffic data.},

 abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in deep learning are enabling new ways of interpreting and analyzing sensor measurements to extract high-level information needed by mobile and IoT apps. Thus for improving usability, it is essential that the deep models are embedded in next generation mobile and IoT apps, where inference tasks are often challenging due to high measurement noise. However, deep learning-based models are yet to become mainstream on embedded platforms, where device resources, e.g., memory, computation and energy, are limited. In this demonstration, we present DeepX, a software accelerator that allows running deep neural network (DNN) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) efficiently on resource constrained mobile platforms. DeepX significantly lowers device resource requirements during deep model- based inferencing, which currently act as the severe bottleneck to wide-scale mobile adoption.},

The path loss estimation of an indoor environment operating at 2.4 GHz is studied by applying the path loss prediction model. The additional path loss (in decibels) caused by the floors between transmitter and receiver in four corridors are predicted by measuring in each floor of Mandalay Technological University (MTU). For same floor measurements, the path loss prediction is small and the standard deviation (σ) is 2.7 dB. When the transmitter is fixed and the receiver is through one floor, the path loss increases and σ is 4.1 dB. In the next situation, the receiver passes through two floors, the path loss is the highest than the other situations and σ is 5.4 dB in corridor1 in MTU. The path loss prediction of the floors increases when the number of floors between the transmitter and receiver is increasing. This indoor path loss prediction model compares the experimental results in different situations of the receiver in indoor wireless network.},

This index structure reduces the using space and searching time. In this index structure, two dimensional coordinate points is converted to the single value by using the Hilbert curve.

However, current WSNs based traditional Geographic Opportunistic Routing (GOR) only focus on the straight regular area, but when comes to the curve strip network, GOR will lose the packet and have a high energy consumption. This paper introduces a robust routing that brings edge detection based region divide and Virtual Sinks to GOR in strip network. Unlike past WSNs routing strategies, this method can cope with the complicated strip network with different curvature in the natural region by dividing them into different sub-regions. As a result, the probability of successful rate is improved up to 91.3%, and the energy consumption rate is reduced up to 3.1%.},

Deep learning specializes on generating hierarchical features in spatial domain, but extending it to temporal axis, still remains an open problem. In our work, we explore how to optimally provide calculated low level motion features to the network, as the network itself is not able to capture temporal dependencies from raw input frames. We also experiment on the effect of providing static scene context information to the network, in the task of recognizing actions. Furthermore, we focus on how to compose sub events, in order to obtain a higher level semantic meaning for more complex events, by setting up a network of LSTM units on top of the system.},

We presented GruMon in Sen et. al, which detects groups accurately under accurate localization assumptions or with the availability of inertial sensors from smartphones carried by the users. However, in most real situations, (1) client-side sensory information is not available, and (2) server-side localization is erroneous. Further, detecting people who not carry mobile phones with them (e.g., children/elders and phones with WiFi turned OFF, which we refer to as ``hidden nodes"), and separating out smaller sub-groups from a larger group that happens to share similar trajectories, remains a challenge. In this demo paper, we present our improved system for group detection in indoor environments. We overcome the key challenges of localization errors, presence of hidden nodes and sub-groups by fusing the WiFi and video sensing modalities.},

 abstract = {Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) are attracting users with the promise of full sensory immersion in virtual environments. Creating the illusion of immersion for a near-eye display results in very heavy rendering workloads: low latency, high framerate, and high visual quality are all needed. Tethered VR setups in which the HMD is bound to a powerful gaming desktop limit mobility and exploration, and are difficult to deploy widely. Products such as Google Cardboard and Samsung GearVR purport to offer any user a mobile VR experience, but their GPUs are power-constrained and therefore fail to produce acceptable frame rate and latency for even scenes of modest visual quality. We present FLASHBACK, a system that overcomes the limitations of both Tethered and Mobile-Rendered HMDs to offer a full-quality VR experience on weak mobile devices. FlashBack does so by serving all of a VR application's high data rate rendering requests from a local cache of pre-rendered HD frames, effectively memoizing prior rendering efforts. Pre-caching avoids the struggle of real-time rendering on a weak mobile GPU while leveraging a prevailing trend among mobile devices: storage is low-power and increasingly abundant, cheap, and often underutilized, while graphical processing remains restricted due to thermal and energy constraints. In addition to handling a static background scene, FlashBack even supports dynamically-moving, animated objects. FlashBack achieves up to a 15x reduction in end-to-end latency, an 8x increase in overall framerate, and a 97x reduction in per-frame energy consumption compared with a local rendering of a desktop-quality VR application on a weak mobile device.},

We hope you enjoy this technical material behind the conference that attracts a diverse set of attendees from both academia and industry and is a leading venue for publications and idea exchange on mobile systems. ACM MobiSys 2016 has a highly selective, single-track program featuring research related to mobile systems and applications. It is an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. Our paper review process this year was highly selective. Out of 197 submissions, the technical program committee accepted only 31 for publication and presentation as full papers, yielding an acceptance rate around 15.73%. Submitted papers underwent a rigorous, multistage review process. First, we checked all submissions for compliance, general quality, and topic match. We administratively rejected those not meeting our submission criteria. We assigned 3 reviewers to papers that survived this stage from the program committee and the external review committee. At the conclusion of this stage, those papers where none of the reviewers recommended acceptance were rejected. We then assigned at least 2 additional reviewers from the program committee to papers that survived, thus totaling at least 5 reviews per paper. An online discussion phase then ensued, resulting in the PC recommending 59 papers for discussion at the PC meeting. The PC meeting was held in person in St. Augustine, FL, USA, the day before ACM HotMobile 2016. At the conclusion of the PC meeting, we tentatively accepted 31 papers to the conference. All tentatively accepted papers were assigned shepherds to help ensure that the authors produce a final manuscript that satisfactorily addresses reviewer comments. All shepherded papers were ultimately accepted to the conference. Our program this year covers an exciting set of topics including operating systems, transport, networking, sensing, security and privacy. It also includes a poster/demo session, a panel, and keynote speakers.},

Therefore, it is inconsistent with the users who has a small network system. In this paper, we introduce an IDSCloud model as a solution to implementing a network IDS based on cloud computing. The IDSCloud provides network IDS as a service over the internet which can be simple in deployment, maintenance, scalability without investing in the new infrastructure.},

Participants can also raise a question about which aspect that are unknown on the birds. Through the web server, people can overlook the distribution and abundance of birds, and answer these questions. This system can not only collect a great deal of data for ecological and biological studies, but also can educate the public about scientific issues and wild bird conservation.},

The civil market related to this field is currently experiencing a continuous growth that highlights its potential. Many applications now make use of such devices for various purposes such as surveillance, communication, video recording or even gaming. One particular domain of application has triggered our interest: with their tradition of using state-of-the-art technology for their production, the cinema industry recently started to exploit the many possibilities offered by these modern flying vehicles. Movie companies have been using drones as a new tool to produce more and more complex and aesthetic camera shots. However, the shooting process currently rely on manual control of the drones which makes it difficult and sometimes inconvenient to work with. Having a solution to autonomously pilot the drone so that it may follow a predefined (or computed in real-time) trajectory is thus definitively useful in such situations.},

A smart tv acts as a display for a smart phone on demand without installing specific software. However, the variety of collaborations among smart devices is limited. Given a smart home environment, a smart door bell equipped with a camera should easily integrate and utilize its newly provided functionality in collaboration with existing devices like using a smart tv as display. Further it should be able to adapt to environmental changes, e.g., when the user changes the room another device should take over the displaying part. Composing distributed adaptive software systems at run time is a challenging topic in decentralized infrastructures like Smart Cities or Internets of Things. Such infrastructures consist of a large set of independent autonomous subsystems from different providers, but only a few subsystems might be involved in a composition. Centralized self-adaptive approaches maintain a global view on the system which is infeasible for large infrastructures. Decentralized approaches are limited in terms of heterogeneity and lack incorporation of new functionality.},

 abstract = {The popularity of wearables continues to rise. However, their functions and applications are constrained by the types of sensors that are currently available. Inertial sensors can only track motions of body parts to which they are attached. Microphones and cameras are powerful but also capture privacy sensitive information. Physiological sensors are intrusive since firm skin contact is necessity. Recently, radio-based sensing has drawn significant attention as it provides a contactless and privacy-preserving approach to detect and monitor human activities. In this work, we demonstrate the search for a new sensing modality for the next generation of wearable devices by exploring the feasibility of radio-based human activity sensing and vital sign monitoring in the context of wearable setting. We envision radio-based sensing has the potential to fundamentally transform wearables as we currently know them. First, we have developed HeadScan, a first-of-its-kind wearable for radio-based sensing of a number of human activities that involve head and mouth movements include eating, drinking, coughing, and speaking. Experimental results highlight the enormous potential of our radio-based sensing approach and provide guidance to future explorations. Second, we have developed BodyScan, a wearable system for radio sensing of human whole body movement. Experimental results indicate that BodyScan is capable of capturing whole body activities with a lifetime of 15 hours.},

 abstract = {Urban air quality in China has been a social concern because of the impact on public health. However, traditional equipments at fixed location only report a global index of the whole city, rather than an index of local area in a city. We present a mobile sensing system using a public bicycle system for monitoring urban air quality, which has a low cost and high spatial resolution. An approach was proposed to calibrate the bicycle-borne sensor. The test indicates that the calibrated data from our sensors approximate to the governmental measurements, and it is feasible to create high-resolution air pollution maps using our mobile sensing system based on the shared bicycle network.},

In particular, redundant implementations exist for similar resource sharing functionalities. Moreover, the capacity of the current resource sharing practice is largely limited to the sharing of resources accessible via application layer.

@inproceedings{Cuervo:2016:PMV:2938559.2938608,
 abstract = {Immersive virtual reality has long been an aspiration of many. For a truly immersive VR experience, three properties are essential: quality, responsiveness and mobility. By quality, we mean that realistic and life-like visual portrayals in a virtual environment heighten our sense of immersion. By responsiveness, we mean that any motion, especially of the head, must be reflected as quickly as possible in visual feedback because ocular proprioception sensitivity is very high. By mobility, we mean that we ought to be able to move untethered in physical space, free to explore our virtual world. Unfortunately mobile devices like phones are tablets are power-constrained and cannot produce acceptable framerate. While cloud offloading allows them to deliver high-quality and framerate it places high bandwidth requirements and introduces an unacceptable amount of latency. This demo introduces Matia, a stereo HMD system that simultaneously attains quality, responsiveness and mobility. Matia achieves this by offloading rendering work to a highend GPU across the WAN. The HMD client is mobile and only requires a low-end GPU, yet receives high quality imagery. To overcome WAN latencies, Matia borrows speculative execution techniques inspired by previous work Outatime [1]. However, speculative execution alone is insufficient. This is because HMD sensitivities are substantially more stringent along several key dimensions: responsiveness and quality.These factors suggest that we ought to greatly benefit from maximally utilizing all available bandwidth between client and server to deliver the highest resolution imagery possible. At the same time, any latency or bandwidth changes must be handled very responsively, lest they deteriorate the user experience and induce simulator sickness. To get the highest possible resolution while remaining responsive to network changes, Matia employs panoramic stereo video and likelihood-based foveation. Specifically, Matia renders a wide field-of-view (FOV) panoramic stereo video. In turn, any possible stereo view (e.g., due to unexpected head movement or network fluctuations) can be generated. Matia then foveates this panorama by reallocating pixels to areas where the user is most likely to look (Maximum Likelyhood View). We divide our panoramic video into three regions described by their image quality: High, Medium and Low. Embedded within is a convex-like optimizer that constantly adapts to real-time data analysis of user head movement and network conditions to figure out the most fruitful foveation configuration, on expectation of these regions. As a result, we expect to achieve high quality immersiveness in the common case, yet still deliver gracefully degraded experiences in case of network degradation. At the same time, Matia greatly expands the scope of viable HMD content while requiring only modest fixed function computation on the HMD device. In this demo we will show Matia running on an Intel Compute Stick driving an Oculus DK2. Our demo shows a scene so graphically detailed that the compute stick is unable to handle it fast enough without offloading it to a server. During the demo, users will be able to observe the high responsiveness and quality of the image even after introducing variable amounts of bandwidth and latency.},

In contrast to web analytics, physical analytics systems typically only provide data relating to sensors and objects without consideration of individual users. This is mainly a consequence of an inability to track individual mobile user interactions across multiple physical objects (or across sessions of interaction with a single object) using, for example, an analogue of a web cookie. Indeed, such a "physical analytics cookie" could raise significant privacy concerns. However, in many cases a more "human-centric" approach to analytics would enable us to provide new and interesting insights into interactions between mobile users and the physical world [1]. In our work we endeavour to leverage synthetic user traces of human mobility, and data from real IoT systems, to provide such insights.},

According to the requirements of data acquisition and analysis, the tree structure sensor network, sensor and communication protocol of the data acquisition was needed. The analysis and modeling was done after downloading the data according the results of the simulation experiment. By analyzing the temperature and moisture data model according to the simulated rainfall experiment, we have found that single position moisture content changing with time are basically identical with theoretical relations. It is proved that the design of this system meet the demands of the analysis of the temperature and moisture monitoring for soil building, and it has a high reliability.},

However, allowing these devices to inter-operate and to access those generated data on a peer-to-peer basis and perform service tasks is still in research.The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) could benefit from resources provided by the connected embedded devices. And one implemented techniques of SOA is Web Services. Applying Web Services on resource-constrained devices often need more resources and computing power than available. This is where Device Profile for Web Service (DPWS) comes into play.The Objective of this project is to create a web service platform on mobile and embedded devices and to let other devices discover and interact with the created services, rather than creating those services in remote server and accessing them, which consumes time and traffic},

 abstract = {This research proposal investigates the promise of Opportunistic or Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) for efficient and effective information dissemination in the context of natural disasters. Natural disasters affect the traditional communication infrastructure and thereby call for different unconventional techniques to meet communication requirements. This is because traditional communication infrastructure may get incapacitated due to the severity of the disaster or lack of power supply. Fortunately, majority of population these days owns various wireless devices, such as smart phones and tablets, with multiple communication interfaces (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). These devices with their alternative communication capabilities can be harnessed in a disaster aftermath in the form of DTNs. The rescue and relief operation immediately after disaster is challenging mainly due to the lack of suitable map based navigation assistance and inadequate information regarding resource inventory. Offering map based navigation services and adequate information regarding resource inventory over DTNs become challenging mainly due to unstable connectivity, modified road networks and decentralized resource management at warehouses. These limitations inspire us to explore the possibilities of offering navigation and distributed resource management services over DTNs.},

In some townships, there are narrowed roads which are not wide enough to enter the vehicles and closed roads which are not passed through the other streets. In the emergency cases (e.g. Accident or Fire), the drivers mistakenly choose these roads, it can cause problems and delays. The main objective of this system is to find the optimal routes between incident site and emergency services without delay caused by closed and narrowed roads. The system uses Multiple Sources Single-Destination (MSSD) Algorithm using node exclusion to calculate optimal route. Our proposed system significantly solves to find the accident location and locate the closest emergency services by using the real-time technology (GPS/GSM).},

An acute exacerbation of COPD is a sudden worsening of the disease. Acute exacerbations result in more frequent and severe coughing and increased difficulty breathing. If not treated quickly, hospitalization may be required which is expensive and decreases patient's quality of life. If untreated, an acute exacerbation can lead to death. We present WearCOPD, an application that uses a smartwatch and smartphone to continuously monitor physiological signs from patients with the goal of predicting exacerbations before they happen.},

Instead of augmenting specialized/proprietary sensors, ForcePhone uses only the phone's built-in sensors to measure the applied force via a physical property called structure-borne sound propagation. ForcePhone has been implemented and evaluated on both iOS and Android phones. Multiple demo applications based on ForcePhone have been implemented and tested. The estimated force is shown highly correlated to the real applied force and the estimation error is low enough to support various applications.

@inproceedings{Ki:2016:DAV:2938559.2948646,
 abstract = {We propose a novel technique called API virtualization to enable open innovation in Android. API virtualization inserts a shim layer between the Android platform layer and the app layer as shown in Figure 1, which can intercept any and every platform API call made by an app. In addition, API virtualization allows third-party developers to inject custom code, so that they can modify, reimplement, or customize existing Android APIs. This is achieved by (i) injecting a wrapper class for each platform API class that a third-party developer wants to replace, and (ii) rewriting the binary of an app so that the app code uses wrapper classes instead of platform API classes. Our API virtualization is motivated by the lack of openness in mobile systems at the platform level. For example, Android is known to be an open platform since the source code is open; thirdparty developers easily access and modify the source. However, when it comes to deploying their platform-level modifications, there is a stiff barrier. Only Google and other mobile vendors such as Samsung, LG, etc. have the privilege to distribute platform modifications at a large scale. In other words, there are only a select few players who can control the innovation on Android.},

Although advent smartphones are equipped with high resolution touchscreens, powerful CPUs and GPUs, the performance of these smartphones is not comparable to desktop computers, especially in processing time and power consumption. Therefore, how to reconstruct 3D models on smartphones to increase its entertainment and functionality is an attractive challenge. In this work, we propose 3DBuilder, a versatile scheme to reconstruct 3D models on smartphones. It includes two parts to collaboratively render 3D models. On the client side, we provide an app running on Android smartphones to achieve image collection, keyframes uploading, 3D models downloading, rendering and displaying. On the cloud server side, cloud servers choose one algorithm from two different algorithms to reconstruct 3D models in non-real time or real-time. We use TCP/IP protocol to connect the client side and cloud server side to send images and models through Cellular network or Wi-Fi. Compared to previous work [1][2][3], 3DBuilder makes full use of mobile cloud computing to assist smartphones in 3D reconstruction.

 abstract = {Several duty-cycling and energy-efficient communication protocols have been presented to solve power constraints of sensor nodes. The battery power of sensor nodes can be also supplied by surrounding energy resources using energy harvesting techniques. However, communication protocols only offer limited power for sensor nodes and energy harvesting may encounter a challenge that sensor nodes are unable to draw power from surrounding energy resources in certain environments. Thus, an emerging technology, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), is proposed to enhance the proposed communication protocols and energy harvesting techniques [1]. With a WRSN, a mobile vehicle is used to supply power to sensor nodes by wireless energy transfer. One of the most significant issue in WRSNs is path planning of the mobile vehicle. The mobile vehicle based on its movement trajectory visits each sensor nodes to recharge them so that the sensor nodes can obtain sufficient energy to execute continuous missions. However, all of the existing mobile vehicles charging methods [2, 3] for WRSNs require the locations of the sensor nodes based on the assumption that the location of each sensor node is known in advance by one of the sensor network localization mechanisms. Therefore, the proposed system integrates both the localization and wireless charging mechanisms for WRSNs to decrease the system initialization time and cost.},

ACM MobiSys 2016 has a highly selective, single-track program featuring research related to mobile systems and applications. It is an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. Our paper review process this year was highly selective. Out of 197 submissions, the technical program committee accepted only 31 for publication and presentation as full papers, yielding an acceptance rate around 15.73%. Submitted papers underwent a rigorous, multistage review process. First, we checked all submissions for compliance, general quality, and topic match. We administratively rejected those not meeting our submission criteria. We assigned 3 reviewers to papers that survived this stage from the program committee and the external review committee. At the conclusion of this stage, those papers where none of the reviewers recommended acceptance were rejected. We then assigned at least 2 additional reviewers from the program committee to papers that survived, thus totaling at least 5 reviews per paper. An online discussion phase then ensued, resulting in the PC recommending 59 papers for discussion at the PC meeting. The PC meeting was held in person in St. Augustine, FL, USA, the day before ACM HotMobile 2016. At the conclusion of the PC meeting, we tentatively accepted 31 papers to the conference. All tentatively accepted papers were assigned shepherds to help ensure that the authors produce a final manuscript that satisfactorily addresses reviewer comments. All shepherded papers were ultimately accepted to the conference. Our program this year covers an exciting set of topics including operating systems, transport, networking, sensing, security and privacy. It also includes a poster/demo session, a panel, and keynote speakers.},

 abstract = {Participatory sensing is a phenomenon where participants use mobile phones or social media and feed data to detect an event. Since, data gathering is open to many participants, one of the major challenges of this type of networks is to identify truthfulness of the reported observations. Finding the reliable sources is a challenging task since the node or participantś reliability is unknown or even the probability of the reported event to be true is also unknown. In our paper, we study this challenge and observe that applying evolu- tionary method, we can identify reliable source nodes. We validate our claim with experimental results and we com- pare our results with a relevant approach and find that our approach is more efficient.},

 abstract = {The sudden growth in the smart-phone industry in recent years has caught the localization technology quite unprepared, with GPS coming out as a trivial solution. Using GPS, although quite effective, results in high energy consumption. This makes way for the several inertial sensors present in smart-phones like accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, etc. There are number of works like UnLoc[3] which use these inertial sensors for pedestrian localization. Looking into outdoor vehicular localization, Dejavu[1] is one of the good solutions. In our research problems we plan to make use of inertial sensors to develop energy efficient navigation systems and the underlying infrastructure required for the same. Here, we present a novel generalized energy-efficient outdoor navigation scheme - UrbanEye[2]},

The challenge lies in the sudden increase of water level once the flood water is in. We are proposing a distributed system using water level monitoring sensors named Shonabondhu. The sensing nodes are distributed all across the country and the servers that collect data from sensors are spread around various regions. We have designed implemented and deployed actual sensors to monitor the water level in the river our current system works as a proof of a concept system before the actual deployment of this system in collaboration of Water Development Board of Bangladesh.},

Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is a solution for efficient energy consumption in sensor networks, which chooses the cluster head randomly. Therefore, this paper not only tries to improve the cluster head selection process by considering the predefined radius of base station or sink node to choose the gateway nodes as relays, but also considers a sleep/awake cycle for the purpose of reducing the energy consumption. The enhanced protocol, namely E-LEACH is expected to reduce energy consumption and prolong the network lifetime for the sensor networks.},
