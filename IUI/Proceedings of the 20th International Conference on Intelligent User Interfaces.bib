 abstract = {It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the 2015 ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces -- ACM IUI 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Starting in 1993, ACM IUI is now in its 20th edition and serves as a premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces. ACM IUI is where the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. We are also very interested in contributions from related fields, such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc. At ACM IUI, we focus on the interaction between machine intelligence and human intelligence. While other conferences focus on one side or the other, we address the complex interaction between the two. We welcome research that explores how to make the interaction between computers and people smarter, which may leverage solutions from data mining, knowledge representation, novel interaction paradigms, and emerging technologies. For the 20th edition of the conference, the call for papers attracted a record number of 205 long and short paper submissions, 41 poster paper submissions, 18 demo paper submissions, and 24 student consortium submissions. The final program of the conference includes 3 keynotes, 47 long and short papers (22.9% acceptance rate), 17 posters, 8 demos, 4 workshops, 3 tutorials, and 12 student consortium papers. The program opens with a keynote by Professor Dan Weld on "Intelligent Control of Crowdsourcing", continues with a keynote by Ed Chi on "Blurring of the Boundary Between Interactive Search and Recommendation" on the second day, and ends with a keynote by Rosalind Picard on "Recognizing Stress, Engagement, and Positive Emotion". Four workshops (Personalized Access to Cultural Heritage, Intelligent Digital Games for Empowerment and Inclusion, Interacting with Smart Objects, and Visual Text Analytics) and three tutorials (Speech-based Interaction, Personalization for Behavior Change, and User Affect and Sentiment Modeling) complement the main conference program.},

Current WSD test setups place information at different distances, but always within the driver's foveal field of view. We built two WSD test setups, which present information not only at various distances within the driver's visual focus, but also in the peripheral field of view. Then we evaluated the display of information in the periphery on both WSD setups in a user study. While making sure the participants would look at the peripheral information, we measured the display's impact on driving performance. Subjects were also asked about their driving experience with the windshield displays and their preference among the two setups.},

 abstract = {Model-based evaluation has been widely used in HCI. However, current predictive models are insufficient to evaluate Natural User Interfaces based on touchless hand gestures. The purpose of this paper is to present a model based on KLM to predict performance time for doing tasks using this interface type. The required model operators were defined considering the temporal structure of hand gestures (i.e. using gesture units) and performing a systematic bibliographic review. The times for these operators were estimated by a user study consisting of various parts. Finally, the model empirical evaluation gave acceptable results (root-mean-square error = 10%, R2 = 0.936) when compared to similar models developed for other interaction styles. Thus, the proposed model should be helpful to software designers to carry out usability assessments by predicting performance time without user participation.},

 abstract = {Reading is central to learning and communicating, however, divided attention in the form of distraction may be present in learning environments, resulting in a limited understanding of the reading material. This paper presents a novel system that can spatio-temporally detect divided attention in users during two different reading applications: typical document reading and speed reading. Eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) monitor the user during reading and provide a classifier with data to decide the user's attention state. The multimodal data informs the system where the user was distracted spatially in the user interface and when the user was distracted. Classification was evaluated with two exploratory experiments. The first experiment was designed to divide the user's attention with a multitasking scenario. The second experiment was designed to divide the users attention by simulating a real-world scenario where the reader is interrupted by unpredictable audio distractions. Results from both experiments show that divided attention may be detected spatio-temporally well above chance on a single-trial basis.},

 abstract = {In mobile augmented reality, text and content placed in a user's immediate field of view through a head worn display can interfere with day to day activities. In particular, messages, notifications, or navigation instructions overlaid in the central field of view can become a barrier to effective face-to-face meetings and everyday conversation. Many text and view management methods attempt to improve text viewability, but fail to provide a non-invasive personal experience for the user. In this paper, we introduce Halo Content, a method that proactively manages movement of multiple elements such as e-mails, texts, and notifications to make sure they do not interfere with interpersonal interactions. Through a unique combination of face detection, integrated layouts, and automated content movement, virtual elements are actively moved so that they do not occlude conversation partners' faces or gestures. Unlike other methods that often require tracking or prior knowledge of the scene, our approach can deal with multiple conversation partners in unknown, dynamic situations. In a preliminary experiment with 14 participants, we show that the Halo Content algorithm results in a 54.8% reduction in the number of times content interfered with conversations compared to standard layouts.},

 abstract = {User interest profiles have become essential for personalizing information streams and services, and user interfaces and experiences. In today's world, social networks such as Facebook or Twitter provide users with a powerful platform for interest expression and can, thus, act as a rich content source for automated user interest modeling. This, however, poses significant challenges because the user generated content on them consists of free unstructured text. In addition, users may not explicitly post or tweet about everything that interests them. Moreover, their interests evolve over time. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised algorithm and system that addresses these challenges. It models a broad range of an individual user's explicit and implicit interests from her social network profile and activities without any user input. We perform extensive evaluation of our system, and algorithm, with a dataset consisting of 488 active Facebook users' profiles and demonstrate that it can accurately estimate a user's interests in practice.},

 abstract = {We present math boxes, a novel pen-based user interface for simplifying the task of hand writing difficult mathematical expressions. Visible bounding boxes around certain subexpressions are automatically generated as the system detects specific relationships including superscripts, subscripts, and fractions. Subexpressions contained in a box can then be extended by adding new terms directly into its given bounds. Upon accepting new characters, box boundaries are dynamically resized and neighboring terms are translated to make room for the larger box. Feedback on structural recognition is given via the boxes themselves. We also provide feedback on character recognition by morphing the user's individual characters into a cleaner version stored in our ink database. To evaluate the usefulness of our proposed method, we conducted a user study in which participants write a variety of equations ranging in complexity from a simple polynomial to the more difficult expected value of the logistic distribution. The math boxes interface is compared against the commonly used offset typeset (small) method, where recognized expressions are typeset in a system font near the user's unmodified ink. In our initial study, we find that the fluidness of the offset method is preferred for simple expressions but as difficulty increases, our math boxes method is overwhelmingly preferred.},

 abstract = {In exploratory search, when a user directs a search engine using uncertain relevance feedback, usability problems regarding controllability and predictability may arise. One problem is that the user is often modelled as a passive source of relevance information, instead of an active entity trying to steer the system based on evolving information needs. This may cause the user to feel that the response of the system is inconsistent with her steering. Another problem arises due to the sheer size and complexity of the information space, and hence of the system, as it may be difficult for the user to anticipate the consequences of her actions in this complex environment. These problems can be mitigated by interpreting the user's actions as setting a goal for an optimization problem regarding the system state, instead of passive relevance feedback, and by allowing the user to see the predicted effects of an action before committing to it. In this paper, we present an implementation of these improvements in a visual user-controllable search interface. A user study involving exploratory search for scientific literature gives some indication on improvements in task performance, usability, perceived usefulness and user acceptance.},

In this work, we look into user interaction with the recommendation list, aiming to devise a method that allows users to discover items of interest in a minimal number of interactions. We propose generalized linear search (GLS), a combination of linear and generalized searches that brings together the benefits of both approaches. We prove that GLS performs at least as well as generalized search and compare our method to several baselines and heuristics. Our evaluation shows that GLS is liked by the users and achieves the shortest interactions.},

 abstract = {In this paper, an online rating game called Image-Battle is developed to build the ground truth dataset for image sentiment analysis. Our goal is to provide more interesting and intuitive interface to users and to collect the images with more correct sentiment scores despite of less human intervention. For this, two schemes are designed: 1) a pair-wise competition and 2) a ranking algorithm based on visual link analysis. First, the system shows two images and asks the user which image is closer to a given sentiment. Thereafter, the ranking algorithm assigns the sentiment scores to the images based on all the competition results: the main idea is to give higher score to images that win more or to the images that beat images with high scores. To evaluate the proposed system, it was used to collect ground truth for 30,000 Photo.net images, each of which was labeled by six emotions. The ground truth was used to develop the sentiment recognition system, and its result was compared with that of other rating system. Then the result proved the excellence of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction.},

However, despite the acknowledged value of customized service for individual patients, research on programming adaptive therapy for individual patients has received little attention. The goal of the current study is to model teletherapy sessions in the form of a generative process for autonomous therapy that approximate the demonstrations of the therapist. The resulting autonomous programs for therapy may imitate the strategy that the therapist might have employed and reinforce therapeutic exercises between teletherapy sessions. We propose to encode the therapist's decision criteria in terms of the patient's motor performance features. Specifically, in this work, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the batch data collected during teletherapy sessions between a single stroke patient and a single therapist. Using the resulting models, the therapeutic exercise targets are generated and are verified with the same therapist who generated the data.},

 abstract = {Search and recommendation engines are increasingly more intelligent. They have become more personalized and social as well as more interactive. No longer just offering ten blue links, search engines have increasingly been integrated with task and item recommenders directly, for example, to offer news, movie, music, and dining suggestions. Vice versa, recommendation systems have increasingly became more search-like by offering capabilities that enable users to tune and direct recommendation results instantly. As the two technologies evolve toward each other, there is increasingly a blurring of the boundary between these two approaches to interactive information seeking. On the search side, this is driven by the merging of question answering capabilities with search, led by systems like Google Now and Apple Siri that move search toward intelligent personal assistants. On the recommendation side, there has been a merging of techniques from not just keyword search but also faceted search, along with user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques and other more proactive recommenders. This blurring has resulted in both critical re-thinking about not just how to architect the systems by merging and sharing backend components common to both types of systems, but also how to structure the user interactions and experiences.},

 abstract = {Information dashboards are a widely used means to present data at-a-glance and their quality (i.e., their ability to communicate the data in a clear and efficient way) depends not only on the way to represent the data but also on how visual elements are placed on the screen - the dashboard layout. In many cases the dashboards are predefined by the application but we are now in an era where the user wants more freedom. Unfortunately this freedom is today bounded by the applications using layout managers which either do not offer the needed flexibility or are too complex to be used by non-experts. In this paper, we propose a novel layout manager more suitable for dashboards; it provides layouts based on a binary space partitioning (BSP) and we show how the user can interactively build and modify them. Then we present how we can compute an optimal solution for such layouts, i.e., how to actually compute the position and size of all visual elements in order for them to be as close as possible to their preferred size while respecting the arrangement decided by the user. This is achieved by automatically generating a set of constraints which are then solved to find the optimal solution. Finally we describe the actual implementation of a lightweight constraint solver in JavaScript - named QPSolver - that can be embedded in a web application and we compare its performance with Cassowary [4], a well-known solver for constraint-based GUI layouts notably used by Apple in OS X and iOS.},

Hairware is a Beauty Technology Prototype that connects chemically metalized hair extensions to a microcontroller turning it into an input device for triggering different objects. Hairware acts as a capacitive touch sensor that detects touch variations on hair and uses machine learning algorithms in order to recognize user's intention. Normally, while someone touches her own hair, unconsciously she is bringing comfort to herself and at the same time is emitting a non-verbal message decodable by an observer. However, when she replays that touch on Hairware, she is not just emitting a message to an observer, because touching her hair would trigger an object, creating in this way, a concealed interface to different devices. Therefore, Hairware brings the opportunity to make conscious use of an unconscious auto-contact behavior. We present Hairware's hardware and software implementation.},

 abstract = {In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth of asynchronous online conversations thanks to the rise of social media. Analyzing and gaining insights from such conversations can be quite challenging for a user, especially when the discussion becomes very long. A promising solution to this problem is topic modeling, since it may help the user to quickly understand what was discussed in the long conversation and explore the comments of interest. However, the results of topic modeling can be noisy and may not match the user's current information needs. To address this problem, we propose a novel topic modeling system for asynchronous conversations that revises the model on the fly based on user's feedback. We then integrate this system with interactive visualization techniques to support the user in exploring long conversations, as well as revising the topic model when the current results are not adequate to fulfill her information needs. An evaluation with real users illustrates the potential benefits of our approach for exploring conversations, when compared to both a traditional interface as well as an interactive visual interface that does not support human-in-the-loop topic model.},

To investigate the potential opportunities for interactions supported by built-in sensors, we present the implementation and evaluation of BeyondTouch, a family of interactions to extend and enrich the input experience of a smartphone.

A recent line of work has modelled user-specific touch behaviour with machine learning methods to reveal spatial targeting error patterns across the screen. These models can also be applied to improve accuracy of touchscreens and keyboards, and to recognise users and hand postures. However, no implementation of these techniques has been made publicly available yet, hindering broader use in research and practical deployments. Therefore, this paper presents a toolkit which implements such touch models for data analysis (Python), mobile applications (Java/Android), and the web (JavaScript). We demonstrate several applications, including hand posture recognition, on touch targeting data collected in a study with 24 participants. We consider different target types and hand postures, changing behaviour over time, and the influence of hand sizes.},

The proposed system can automatically judge whether a user is engaged with virtual content in the display or focused on the real environment and can determine his or her cognitive state. With these analytic capacities, we implement several proactive system functions including adaptive brightness, scrolling, messaging, notification, and highlighting, which would otherwise require manual interaction. The goal is to manage the relationship between virtual and real, creating a more cohesive and seamless experience for the user. We conduct user experiments including attention engagement and cognitive state analysis, such as reading detection and gaze position estimation in a wearable display towards the design of augmented reality text display applications. The results from the experiments show robustness of the attention engagement and cognitive state analysis methods. A majority of the experiment participants (8/12) stated the proactive system functions are beneficial.},

 abstract = {Finding the differences and similarities between two datasets is a common analytics task. With temporal event sequence data, this task is complex because of the many ways single events and event sequences can differ between the two datasets (or cohorts) of records: the structure of the event sequences (e.g., event order, co-occurring events, or event frequencies), the attributes of events and records (e.g., patient gender), or metrics about the timestamps themselves (e.g., event duration). In exploratory analyses, running statistical tests to cover all cases is time-consuming and determining which results are significant becomes cumbersome. Current analytics tools for comparing groups of event sequences emphasize a purely statistical or purely visual approach for comparison. This paper presents a taxonomy of metrics for comparing cohorts of temporal event sequences, showing that the problem-space is bounded. We also present a visual analytics tool, CoCo (for "Cohort Comparison"), which implements balanced integration of automated statistics with an intelligent user interface to guide users to significant, distinguishing features between the cohorts. Lastly, we describe two early case studies: the first with a research team studying medical team performance in the emergency department and the second with pharmacy researchers.},

Search systems tailored for well-defined narrow search tasks may be suboptimal for exploratory search where the user can sequentially refine the expressions of her information needs and explore alternative search directions. A major challenge for exploratory search systems design is how to support such behavior and expose the user to relevant yet novel information that can be difficult to discover by using conventional query formulation techniques. We introduce IntentStreams, a system for exploratory search that provides interactive query refinement mechanisms and parallel visualization of search streams. The system models each search stream via an intent model allowing rapid user feedback. The user interface allows swift initiation of alternative and parallel search streams by direct manipulation that does not require typing. A study with 13 participants shows that IntentStreams provides better support for branching behavior compared to a conventional search system.},

A key to the success of CQA services is the quality and timeliness of the responses that users get. With the increasing use of mobile devices, searchers increasingly expect to find more local and time-sensitive information, such as the current special at a cafe around the corner. Yet, few services provide such hyper-local and time-aware question answering. This requires intelligent content recommendation and careful use of notifications (e.g., recommending questions to only selected users). To explore these issues, we developed RealQA, a real-time CQA system with a mobile interface, and performed two user studies: a formative pilot study with the initial system design, and a more extensive study with the revised UI and algorithms. The research design combined qualitative survey analysis and quantitative behavior analysis under different conditions. We report our findings of the prevalent information needs and types of responses users provided, and of the effectiveness of the recommendation and notification strategies on user experience and satisfaction. Our system and findings offer insights and implications for designing real-time CQA systems, and provide a valuable platform for future research.},

 abstract = {HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. The goal of this course is to inform the IUI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that IUI researchers and general HCI, UI, and UX practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.},

 abstract = {The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has been remarkable in the last few years. A significant amount of MOOCs content is in the form of videos and participants often use non-linear navigation to browse through a video. This paper proposes the design of a system that provides non-linear navigation in educational videos using features derived from a combination of audio and visual content of a video. It provides multiple dimensions for quickly navigating to a given point of interest in a video i.e., customized dynamic time-aware word-cloud, video pages, and a 2-D timeline. In word-cloud, the relative placement of the words indicates their temporal ordering in the video whereas color codes are used to represent acoustic stress. The 2-D timeline is used to present multiple occurrences of a keyword/concept in the video in response to user click in the word-cloud. Additionally, visual content is analyzed to identify frames with "maximum written content", known as video pages. We conducted a user study with 20 users to evaluate the proposed system and compared it with transcription-based interfaces used by major MOOC providers. Our findings suggest that the proposed system leads to statistically significant navigation time savings especially on multimodal navigation tasks.},

 abstract = {It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the 2015 ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces -- ACM IUI 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Starting in 1993, ACM IUI is now in its 20th edition and serves as a premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces. ACM IUI is where the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. We are also very interested in contributions from related fields, such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc. At ACM IUI, we focus on the interaction between machine intelligence and human intelligence. While other conferences focus on one side or the other, we address the complex interaction between the two. We welcome research that explores how to make the interaction between computers and people smarter, which may leverage solutions from data mining, knowledge representation, novel interaction paradigms, and emerging technologies. For the 20th edition of the conference, the call for papers attracted a record number of 205 long and short paper submissions, 41 poster paper submissions, 18 demo paper submissions, and 24 student consortium submissions. The final program of the conference includes 3 keynotes, 47 long and short papers (22.9% acceptance rate), 17 posters, 8 demos, 4 workshops, 3 tutorials, and 12 student consortium papers. The program opens with a keynote by Professor Dan Weld on "Intelligent Control of Crowdsourcing", continues with a keynote by Ed Chi on "Blurring of the Boundary Between Interactive Search and Recommendation" on the second day, and ends with a keynote by Rosalind Picard on "Recognizing Stress, Engagement, and Positive Emotion". Four workshops (Personalized Access to Cultural Heritage, Intelligent Digital Games for Empowerment and Inclusion, Interacting with Smart Objects, and Visual Text Analytics) and three tutorials (Speech-based Interaction, Personalization for Behavior Change, and User Affect and Sentiment Modeling) complement the main conference program.},

 abstract = {User profiling techniques play a central role in many Recommender Systems (RS). In recent years, multidimensional data are getting increasing attention for making recommendations. Additional metadata help algorithms better understanding users' behaviors and decisions. Existing user/item profiling techniques for Collaborative Filtering (CF) RS in multidimensional environment mostly analyze data through splitting the multidimensional relations. However, this leads to the loss of multidimensionality in user-item interactions; whereas the interactions are naturally multidimensional since users' choices are often affected by contextual information. In this paper, we propose a unified profiling approach which models users/items with latent higher-order interaction factors. We demonstrate that the proposed profiling approach is intimately related to two-dimensional profiling based on Matrix Factorization techniques. We further propose to integrate the profiling approach into three neighborhood-based CF recommenders for item recommendation. Finally, we empirically show on real-world social tagging datasets that the proposed recommenders outperform state-of-the-art CF recommendation approaches in accuracy.},

 abstract = {We propose an approach to automatically select a set of representative images to generate a concise visual summary of a real-world event from the Tumblr microblogging platform. Central to our approach is a unified graph model with heterogeneous nodes and edges to capture the interrelationship among various entities (e.g., users, posts, images, and tags) in online social media. With the graph representation, we then cast the summarization problem as a graph-based ranking problem by identifying the most representative images regarding to an event. The intuition behind our work is that not only can we crowdsource social media users as sensors to capture and share data, but we can also use them as filters to identify the most useful information through analyzing their interaction in the microblogging network. In addition, we propose a greedy algorithm to encourage diversity among top ranked results for the generation of temporal highlights of targeted events. Our approach is flexible to support different query tasks and is adaptable to additional graph entities and relationships.},

At the same time, they reveal potential to increase the accessibility of systems like touch based smartphones and other mobile devices for visually impaired users. However, for this potential to be realised, it is paramount that these techniques can be used in a multitude of contextual settings, and, ideally, do not impose training and calibration procedures. Our approach intends to optimize signal filtering, feature extraction parameters and classifier configurations for each defined gesture. The results show a 98.35% accuracy for the optimized classifier. We proceeded to conduct a validation study (15 participants) in three contexts: seated, standing and walking. Our findings show that, despite the gesture being trained by someone not participating in the study, the average accuracy was 94.67%. We also concluded that, while walking, false positives can impact its usefulness.},

 abstract = {Statistical topic models have become a useful and ubiquitous text analysis tool for large corpora. One common application of statistical topic models is to support topic-centric navigation and exploration of document collections at the user interface by automatically grouping documents into coherent topics. For today's constantly expanding document collections, topic models need to be updated when new documents become available. Existing work on topic model update focuses on how to best fit the model to the data, and ignores an important aspect that is closely related to the end user experience: topic model stability. When the model is updated with new documents, the topics previously assigned to old documents may change, which may result in a disruption of end users' mental maps between documents and topics, thus undermining the usability of the applications. In this paper, we describe a user-directed non-disruptive topic model update system, nTMU, that balances the tradeoff between finding the model that fits the data and maintaining the stability of the model from end users' perspective. It employs a novel constrained LDA algorithm (cLDA) to incorporate pair-wise document constraints, which are converted from user feedback about topics, to achieve topic model stability. Evaluation results demonstrate advantages of our approach over previous methods.},

 abstract = {Finding patterns is a common task in time series analysis which has gained a lot of attention across many fields. A multitude of similarity measures have been introduced to perform pattern searches. The accuracy of such measures is often evaluated objectively using a one nearest neighbor classification (1NN) on labeled time series or through clustering. Prior work often disregards the subjective similarity of time series which can be pivotal in systems where a user specified pattern is used as input and a similarity-based ranking is expected as output (query-by-example). In this paper, we describe how a human-annotated ranking based on real-world queries and datasets can be created using simple crowdsourcing tasks and use this ranking as ground-truth to evaluate the perceived accuracy of existing time series similarity measures. Furthermore, we show how different sampling strategies and time series representations of pen-drawn queries effect the precision of these similarity measures and provide a publicly available dataset which can be used to optimize existing and future similarity search algorithms.},

However, the effect of prediction algorithms on users who are performing open-ended data exploration tasks through a search interface is not well understood. This paper describes a study of three interface variations of a tool for analyzing commuter traffic anomalies in the San Francisco Bay Area. The system supports novel interaction between a prediction algorithm and a human analyst, and is designed to explore the boundaries, limitations and synergies of both. The degree of explanation of underlying data and algorithmic process was varied experimentally across each interface. The experiment (N=197) was performed to assess the impact of algorithm transparency/explanation on data analysis tasks in terms of search success, general insight into the underlying data set and user experience. Results show that 1) presence of recommendations in the user interface produced a significant improvement in recall of anomalies, 2) participants were able to detect anomalies in the data that were missed by the algorithm, 3) participants who used the prediction algorithm performed significantly better when estimating quantities in the data, and 4) participants in the most explanatory condition were the least biased by the algorithm's predictions when estimating quantities.},

It takes account of the relevance of the interruption to the meeting, whether the user is busy and the sensed location of the smartphone.

Learning curves are mathematical models that can represent a user's skill acquisition ability through parameters that describe the user's initial expertise as well as her learning rate. This information could be used by an interface to provide adaptive support to users who may otherwise be slow in learning the necessary skills. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of predicting in real time a user's learning curve when working with ValueChart, an interactive visualization for decision making. Our models leverage various data sources (a user's gaze behavior, pupil dilation, cognitive abilities), and we show that they outperform a baseline that leverages only knowledge on user task performance so far. We also show that the best performing model achieves good accuracies in predicting users' learning curves even after observing users' performance only on a few tasks. These results are promising toward the design of user-adaptive visualizations that can dynamically support a user in acquiring the necessary skills to complete visual tasks.},

 abstract = {Text-based counseling and support systems have seen an increasing proliferation in the past decade. We present Fathom, a natural language interface to help crisis counselors on Crisis Text Line, a new 911-like crisis hotline that takes calls via text messaging rather than voice. Text messaging opens up the opportunity for software to read the messages as well as people, and to provide assistance for human counselors who give clients emotional and practical support. Crisis counseling is a tough job that requires dealing with emotionally stressed people in possibly life-critical situations, under time constraints. Fathom is a system that provides topic modeling of calls and graphical visualization of topic distributions, updated in real time. We develop a mixed-initiative paradigm to train coherent topic and word distributions and use them to power real-time visualizations aimed at reducing counselor cognitive overload. We believe Fathom to be the first real-time computational framework to assist in crisis counseling.},

 abstract = {Recent technological advances have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring people's heart rates through commodity cameras by capturing users' skin transparency changes, color changes, or involuntary motion. However, such raw image data collected during everyday interactions (e.g. gaming, learning, and fitness training) is often noisy and intermittent, especially in mobile contexts. Such interference causes increased error rates, latency, and even detection failures for most existing algorithms. In this paper, we present BayesHeart, a probabilistic algorithm that extracts both heart rates and distinct phases of the cardiac cycle directly from raw fingertip transparency signals captured by camera phones. BayesHeart is based on an adaptive hidden Markov model, requires minimal training data and is user-independent. Through a comparative study of twelve state-of-the-art algorithms covering the design space of noise reduction and pulse counting, we found that BayesHeart outperforms existing algorithms in both accuracy and speed for noisy, intermittent signals.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the design and evaluation of a set of intelligent tutoring agents constructed to teach teams of students an authentic process of inquiry-driven modeling. The paper first presents the theoretical grounding for inquiry-driven modeling as both a teaching strategy and a learning goal, and then presents the need for guided instruction to improve learning of this skill. However, guided instruction is difficulty to provide in a one-to-many classroom environment, and thus, this paper makes the case that interaction with a metacognitive tutoring system can help students acquire the skill. The paper then describes the design of an exploratory learning environment, the Modeling and Inquiry Learning Application (MILA), and an accompanying set of metacognitive tutors (MILA--T). These tools were used in a controlled experiment with 84 teams (237 total students) in which some teams received and interacted with the tutoring system while other teams did not. The effect of this experiment on teams' demonstration of inquiry-driven modeling are presented.},

 abstract = {Enabling natural and intuitive communication with robots calls for the design of intelligent user interfaces. As robots are introduced into applications with novice users, the information obtained from such users may not always be reliable. This paper describes a user interface approach to process and correct intended paths for robot navigation as sketched by users on a touchscreen. Our approach demonstrates that by processing video frames from an overhead camera and by using composite Bézier curves to interpolate smooth paths from a small set of significant points, low-resolution occupancy grid maps (OGMs) with numeric potential fields can be continuously updated to correct unsafe user-drawn paths at interactive speeds. The approach generates sufficiently complex paths that appear to bend around static and dynamic obstacles. The results of an evaluation study show that our approach captures the user intent while relieving the user from being concerned about her path-drawing abilities.},

This paper describes a Wizard-of-Oz study which investigates whether the way feedback is presented should change according to the affective state of a student, in order to encourage affect change if that state is negative. We presented 'high-interruptive' feedback in the form of pop-up windows in which messages were immediately viewable; or 'low-interruptive' feedback, a glowing light bulb which students needed to click in order to access the messages. Our results show that when students are confused or frustrated high-interruptive feedback is more effective, but when students are enjoying their activity, there is no difference. Based on the results, we present guidelines for adaptively tailoring the presentation of feedback based on students' affective states when interacting with learning environments.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2014 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI'14). It is the nineteenth IUI conference, continuing its tradition of being the principal international forum for reporting outstanding research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The work that appears at IUI bridges these two fields and also delves into related fields, such as psychology, cognitive science, computer graphics, the arts, and many others. Members of the IUI community are interested in improving the symbiosis between humans and computers, and in making systems adapt to humans rather then the other way round. The call for papers attracted 191 submissions from Asia, America Europe, Africa, and Australia. The program committee accepted 46 papers, covering a diverse set of topics, reflected in the session titles "From Touch through Air to Brain" "Learning and Skills", "Intelligent Visual Interaction", "Users and Motion", "Leveraging Social Competencies", "Adaptive User Interfaces" and a special session with papers that honor the memory of John Riedl, who left us too early. A great attraction of the conference is provided by the scientific keynotes: Professor Wolfgang Wahlster opens the conference program with a keynote on "Multiadaptive Interfaces to Cyber-Physical Environments", Professor Noam Tractinsky's second day keynote is on "Visual Aesthetics of Interactive Technologies" and the last day keynote, by Professor Mark Billinghurst is on "Using AR to Create Empathic Experiences". In addition we are pleased to offer an invited talk by a relevant industry speaker, Yanki Margalit: "Startup nation and the Makers revolution. Intelligent user interfaces and the future of the Israeli hi-tech". We also have 11 posters and an excellent demonstration program consisting of 27 demos. In addition, the conference provides four very interesting workshops and a student consortium.},

In this paper, we attempt to automate the process of social skills training by developing a dialogue system named "automated social skills trainer," which provides social skills training through human-computer interaction. The system includes a virtual avatar that recognizes user speech and language information and gives feedback to users to improve their social skills. Its design is based on conventional social skills training performed by human participants, including defining target skills, modeling, role-play, feedback, reinforcement, and homework. An experimental evaluation measuring the relationship between social skill and speech and language features shows that these features have a relationship with autistic traits. Additional experiments measuring the effect of performing social skills training with the proposed application show that most participants improve their skill by using the system for 50 minutes.},
