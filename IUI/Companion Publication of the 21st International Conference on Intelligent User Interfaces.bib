 abstract = {It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the 2015 ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces -- ACM IUI 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Starting in 1993, ACM IUI is now in its 20th edition and serves as a premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces. ACM IUI is where the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community meets the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. We are also very interested in contributions from related fields, such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc. At ACM IUI, we focus on the interaction between machine intelligence and human intelligence. While other conferences focus on one side or the other, we address the complex interaction between the two. We welcome research that explores how to make the interaction between computers and people smarter, which may leverage solutions from data mining, knowledge representation, novel interaction paradigms, and emerging technologies. For the 20th edition of the conference, the call for papers attracted a record number of 205 long and short paper submissions, 41 poster paper submissions, 18 demo paper submissions, and 24 student consortium submissions. The final program of the conference includes 3 keynotes, 47 long and short papers (22.9% acceptance rate), 17 posters, 8 demos, 4 workshops, 3 tutorials, and 12 student consortium papers. The program opens with a keynote by Professor Dan Weld on "Intelligent Control of Crowdsourcing", continues with a keynote by Ed Chi on "Blurring of the Boundary Between Interactive Search and Recommendation" on the second day, and ends with a keynote by Rosalind Picard on "Recognizing Stress, Engagement, and Positive Emotion". Four workshops (Personalized Access to Cultural Heritage, Intelligent Digital Games for Empowerment and Inclusion, Interacting with Smart Objects, and Visual Text Analytics) and three tutorials (Speech-based Interaction, Personalization for Behavior Change, and User Affect and Sentiment Modeling) complement the main conference program.},

 abstract = {The drum tracks of electronic dance music are a central and style-defining element. Yet, creating them can be a cumbersome task, mostly due to lack of appropriate tools and input devices. In this work we present an artificial-intelligence-powered software prototype, which supports musicians composing the rhythmic patterns for drum tracks. Starting with a basic pattern (seed pattern), which is provided by the user, a list of variations with varying degree of similarity to the seed pattern is generated. The variations are created using a generative stochastic neural network. The interface visualizes the patterns and provides an intuitive way to browse through them. A user study with ten experts in electronic music production was conducted to evaluate five aspects of the presented prototype. For four of these aspects the feedback was generally positive. Only regarding the use case in live environments some participants showed concerns and requested safety features.},

Approximately 95% of D/HH children are born to hearing parents. Research indicates that the lack of common communication tools between the parent and child often results in delayed development in the child's language and social skills. Benefiting from the interactive advantages and popularity of touchscreen mobile devices, we created SmartSignPlay, an app to teach D/HH children and their families everyday ASL vocabulary and phrases. Vocabulary is arranged into context-based lessons where the vocabulary is frequently used. After watching the sign demonstrated by an animated avatar, the user performed the sign by drawing the trajectory of the hand movement and selecting the correct handshape. While the app is still under iterative development, preliminary results on the usability are provided.},

In this demonstration, we present MMToC: Multimodal Method for Table of Content, a technique that automatically generates a table of content for a given instructional video and enables text-book-like efficient navigation through the video. MMToC quantifies word saliency for visual words extracted from the slides and spoken words obtained from the lecture transcript. These saliency scores are combined using a dynamic programming based segmentation algorithm to identify likely points in the video where the topic has changed. MMToC is a web-based modular solution that can be used as a stand alone video navigation solution or can be integrated with any e-platform for multimedia content management. MMToC can be seen in action on a sample video at http://104.130.241.45:8080/TopicTransitionV2/index.html.},

First, we cluster the Reddit posts into different categories based on crowd position and opinions, and generate informative clustering labels using the human computation technique. Second, we create an intelligent user interface with Reddit posts category visualization. This would expose categorized posts of different positions and opinions to users, and motivate users to hunt for posts supported by unlike-minded people.},

The framework comprises of an eye tracker and a foot-operated quasi-mouse that is wearable. The system evaluation shows that our gaze and foot interaction framework performs as good as a mouse (time and precision) in the majority of tasks. Furthermore, this dissertation work focuses on the goal of realizing gaze-assisted interaction as a primary interaction modality to substitute conventional mouse and keyboard-based interaction methods.

The main reason for this is that the user learns while searching, which causes changes in the relevance of items and features as estimated by the user -- a phenomenon known as {it concept drift}. It might be helpful for the user to see the recent history of her feedback and get suggestions from the system about the accuracy of that feedback. In this paper we present a timeline interface that visualizes the feedback history, and a Bayesian regression model that can estimate jointly the user's current interests and the accuracy of each user feedback. We demonstrate that the user model can improve retrieval performance over a baseline model that does not estimate accuracy of user feedback. Furthermore, we show that the new interface provides usability improvements, which leads to the users interacting more with it.},

On the other hand, there is a need to improve health care assistance to the population, and especially to elderly people. This will mostly benefit specific user groups, such as elderly, patients recovering from physical injury, or athletes. This paper describes a wearable sleeve being developed under the scope of the Augmented Human Assistance (AHA) project for assisting people. It proposes a new architecture for providing haptic feedback through patterns created by multiple actuators. Different sensing technologies are analyzed and discussed.},

In this paper, we present an approach to projecting the hand movements of experts at real size, and real speed and onto real objects in order to match the manual work movements of novices to those of experts. We prototyped a projector-camera system, which projects the virtual hands of experts. We conducted a user study in which users worked after watching experts work under two conditions: using a display and using our prototype system. The results show our prototype users worked more precisely and felt the tasks were easier. User ratings also show our prototype users watched videos of experts more fixedly, memorized them more clearly and distinctly tried to work in the same way shown in the videos as compared with display users.},

 abstract = {Songwriting is the interplay of a composer's creative intent and an idiom's language. This language both facilitates and poses stylistic constraints on a composer's expressivity. Novice composers often find it difficult to go beyond common chord progressions, to find the chords that realize their intentions. To make it easier for composers to experiment with radical chord choices and to prototype "what-if" ideas, we are building a creativity support tool, ChordRipple, which (1) makes chord recommendations that aim to be both diverse and appropriate to the current context, (2) infers a composer's intention to help her more quickly prototype ideas. Composers can use it to help select the next chord, to replace sequences of chords in an internally consist manner, or to edit one part of a sequence and see the whole sequence change in that direction. To make such recommendations, we adapt neural-network models such as Word2Vec to the music domain as Chord2Vec. This model learns chord embeddings from a corpus of chord sequences, placing chords nearby when they are used in similar contexts. The learned embeddings support creative substitutions between chords, and also exhibit topological properties that correspond to musical structure. For example, the major and minor chords are both arranged in the latent space in shapes corresponding to the circle-of-fifths. To support the dynamic nature of the creative process, we propose to infer a composer's intentions for adaptive recommendation. As a composer makes chord changes, she is moving in the embedding space. We can infer a composer's intention from the gradient of her edits' trace and use this gradient to help her fine-tune her current changes or to project the sequence into the future to give recommendations on how the sequence could look like if more edits in that direction were performed.},

ACM IUI is "where HCI meets AI," or where the academic research communities of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) intersect. As the premier international forum for reporting outstanding research and development on intelligent user interfaces, the conference welcomes submissions describing work at the cross-section of these two fields and other related fields, such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, and many others. Members of the ACM IUI community are interested in improving the symbiosis between humans and computers, increasing the intelligence of both in the process. The call for papers attracted 194 long and short paper submissions, 31 poster paper submissions, 11 demo paper submissions, and 17 student consortium submissions. The final program of the conference includes 2 keynotes, 49 long and short papers (25.3% acceptance rate), 15 posters, 6 demos, 2 workshops, 1 tutorial, and 12 student consortium papers. We are particularly excited for the keynotes by two distinguished speakers that will open the first and third days of the conference. The opening keynote will be given by Xavier Amatriain, VP of Engineering at Quora, on the topic of the "Past, Present, and Future of Recommender Systems: An Industry Perspective." The closing keynote will be given by Professor Elisabeth André, from Augsburg University and a long-time member of the ACM IUI community, on the topic of "Socially-Sensitive Interfaces: From Offline Studies to Interactive Experiences." The conference could not be organized without the help of a large number of individuals who generously volunteered much of their own time. Their names can be found on the following pages. All of the members of the organizing committee have done a fantastic job of coordinating the many moving parts that go into putting on a great conference. We must also particularly thank our 34 senior program committee members for coordinating the papers review process and the 91 members of the program committee for providing high quality reviews. And, most important, we must thank the authors for their diligent work that resulted in so many great submissions. These have allowed us to develop the excellent program that is the enduring heart of the conference. Another key for any great conference is a collection of strong sponsor organizations and generous corporate supporters. Our sponsors ACM, SIGAI, and SIGCHI are instrumental in making the conference happen year in and year out. This year, SIGCHI and SIGAI were particularly generous in providing financial support for our student travel grants, which have enabled 19 students to attend the conference that might not have otherwise. Our corporate supporters, Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Tableau have been supremely generous and the conference would be weaker without their contributions. We hope you will find the program engaging and the mix of academic disciplines broadens your perspective on computing. We also hope the conference will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from around the world, whether through presenting your own work formally or through informal discussions during the banquet or coffee breaks. With luck, those shared ideas will manifest themselves in exciting papers at next year's conference and ultimately have impact far beyond the conference! If you have any suggestions for how to improve the conference either this year or in the future, please do not hesitate to let us know.},

We also hope the conference will provide you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from around the world, whether through presenting your own work formally or through informal discussions during the banquet or coffee breaks. With luck, those shared ideas will manifest themselves in exciting papers at next year's conference and ultimately have impact far beyond the conference! If you have any suggestions for how to improve the conference either this year or in the future, please do not hesitate to let us know.},

 abstract = {Eye movement is expected to provide important clues for analyzing the human reading process. However, the noisy tracking environment makes it difficult to map the gaze data captured by eye-trackers to the user's intended word. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for accurately mapping a fixation to a word in the text. Our method regards consecutive horizontally progressive fixations as a sequential reading segment. We first classify transitions between segments according to six classes, and then identify the set of segments associated with each line of the document. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 87% mapping accuracy (15% higher than our previous work) with a classification performance of 84%. We also confirmed that manual annotation time can be reduced by using our approach as a reference. We believe that our method provides sufficiently good accuracy to warrant future analysis.},

@inproceedings{Tanase:2016:SSV:2876456.2879473,
 abstract = {The IMOTION system is a content-based video search engine that provides fast and intuitive known item search in large video collections. User interaction consists mainly of sketching, which the system recognizes in real-time and makes suggestions based on both visual appearance of the sketch (what does the sketch look like in terms of colors, edge distribution, etc.) and semantic content (what object is the user sketching). The latter is enabled by a predictive sketch-based UI that identifies likely candidates for the sketched object via state-of-the-art sketch recognition techniques and offers on-screen completion suggestions. In this demo, we show how the sketch-based video retrieval of the IMOTION system is used in a collection of roughly 30,000 video shots. The system indexes collection data with over 30 visual features describing color, edge, motion, and semantic information. Resulting feature data is stored in ADAM, an efficient database system optimized for fast retrieval.},

 abstract = {Learning objects authoring is still a complex and time-consuming task for instructors, which requires attention to technical and pedagogical aspects. However, one can take advantage of the Ubiquitous Learning Environments characteristics to make it a mild process by means of automatic or semi-automatic processes. In this way, this paper presents an approach for creating learning objects and their metadata in such environments considering collaborative interactions among users. The proposed approach is being integrated to a real multimedia capture system used as a complementary tool in a university.},
