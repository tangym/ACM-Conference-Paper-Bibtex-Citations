 abstract = {Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending organizations enable an individual to obtain an unsecured loan from a collection of individuals without the participation of a bank. Previous research has addressed the use of reputation systems to reduce information asymmetry based on individual history within online markets. Within the last few years one of the market leaders in P2P lending, Prosper.com, has sought to replace the information vetting and monitoring typically done by the bank with a community of users free to select its community members based on any criteria it chooses. By embedding individual reputations within a community reputation, incentives become aligned for peers to select highly qualified borrowers and produce more costly information signals to reduce the adverse selection and moral hazard risk typical of any principle-agent relationship. This study draws on theory from the Principle-Agent perspective to empirically examine the signals that enhance community reputation.},

These mental structures or schemas evoke behavioral scripts. In this paper, we explore two different scripts, receptionist and information kiosk, that we propose channeled visitors' interactions with an interactive robot. We analyzed visitors' typed verbal responses to a receptionist robot in a university building. Half of the visitors greeted the robot (e.g., "hello") prior to interacting with it. Greeting the robot significantly predicted a more social script: more relational conversational strategies such as sociable interaction and politeness, attention to the robot's narrated stories, self-disclosure, and less negative/rude behaviors. The findings suggest people's first words in interaction can predict their schematic orientation to an agent, making it possible to design agents that adapt to individuals during interaction. We propose designs for interactive computational agents that can elicit people's cooperation.},

We then describe an interview study in which we asked 22 participants from America, Korea, India and China about their perceptions of media and motivations for media choices in different hypothetical settings. The results suggest cultural differences in how media are perceived, specifically, that the ability for media to support social in addition to task processes is more important for participants from China, Korea and India than for participants from the U.S. We conclude with some recommendations for enhancing CMC theories to account for cultural differences.},

Second, we explore both direct and indirect effects of these inequalities, exposing the intricate relationships between global inequality, local inequality, coordination, and article quality. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of a Wikipedia articles using structural equation modeling and found that global inequality exerts significant positive impact on article quality, while the effect of local inequality is indirect and is mediated by coordination},

There is little research dealing with disconnection in synchronous groupware from a user and application perspective; as a result, most current groupware systems do not handle disconnection events well, and several user-level problems occur. To address this limitation, we developed the Disco framework, a model for handling several types of disconnection in synchronous groupware. The framework considers how disconnections are identified, what senders and receivers should do during an absence, and what should be done with accumulated data upon reconnection. We have implemented the framework in three applications that show the feasibility, generality, and functionality of our ideas. Our framework is the first to deal with a full range of disconnection issues for synchronous groupware, and shows how groupware can better support the realities of distributed collaboration.},

Traditionally, it is the Software Engineering community that researches issue tracking systems, where software defects are reported and tracked as 'bug reports' within an archival database. Yet, as issue tracking is fundamentally a social process, it is important to understand the design and use of issue tracking systems from that perspective. Consequently, we conducted a qualitative study of issue tracking systems as used by small, collocated software development teams. We found that an issue tracker is not just a database for tracking bugs, features, and inquiries, but also a focal point for communication and coordination for many stakeholders within and beyond the software team. Customers, project managers, quality assurance personnel, and programmers all contribute to the shared knowledge and persistent communication that exists within the issue tracking system. These results were all the more striking because in spite of teams being collocated--which afforded frequent, face-to-face communication--the issue tracker was still used as a fundamental communication channel. We articulate various real-world practices surrounding issue trackers and offer design considerations for future systems.},

@proceedings{Begole:2008:1460563,
 abstract = {In just over two decades, CSCW has grown from a small group of researchers that recognized their shared interests across a variety of disciplines to a community that draws members from around the world and an even wider range of fields and interests. This year's conference continues that expansion, as you will find presentations on gaming, technology in the home, healthcare applications, social networking, and cross-cultural collaboration. The ACM CSCW Conference has a special role in compiling the most recent work in the field and creating a forum to share and build on that work to move the community forward. The premier status of ACM's CSCW Conference is hard-earned, in part because of its rigorous review process. Here is a glimpse into how this review process works. For the first time this year, Full Papers (10 pages) and Notes (4 pages) submissions were reviewed under the same process and Program Committee. The three Papers and Notes chairs brought together perspectives from academia, corporate research, user studies, design, experimental methods, and mobile devices to select 36 Associate Chairs (ACs) to help oversee the review process. The set of ACs reflects the diversity of the community: 14 females, 22 males; 12 from industry, 24 from academia; 7 Europeans, 3 Canadians, 1 Japanese, and 25 Americans. They included well-established researchers as well as new rising stars with a diverse range of interests including systems design, groupware system building, psychology, social science, management science, and ethnography. Each AC was given about 10 -- 12 submissions (a mix of Papers and Notes) to manage. They selected at least three knowledgeable and willing referees for each submission. Refereeing was through blind review. Each referee returned a recommendation along with a detailed review. ACs and the Papers and Notes chairs then examined a paper's reviews for consistency, sometimes asking for additional reviews if the existing ones were considered inadequate or if there was a wide divergence of opinion. The Papers and Notes Chairs as well as all ACs then met in San Diego. Submissions with uniformly low reviews well below the acceptance threshold were rejected outright. Similarly, submissions with uniformly high reviews were accepted. Even so, any AC could indicate any submission for further discussion. This still left a large number of papers in the middle, where each was actively discussed by the committee. Each paper that was discussed was read before-hand by at least two ACs, and these two would deliberate over the paper, raise issues with the committee, and discuss thorny problems with all. While the ACs who read the paper made the final recommendation, the decision process was highly visible so that all could apply the same standards to their own papers. In total, 370 submissions were received this year consisting of 235 Papers and 135 Notes. In the end, 64 Papers (27%) and 22 Notes (16%) were accepted. This selective acceptance rate is similar to historical acceptance rates at CSCW and our partner conferences UIST and CHI. Of course, this is not a perfect process. There is always the issue of where to 'draw the line' between accepted and rejected submissions. Some rejected submissions were very close to the edge, and the committee agonized over these. The committee was also limited in that they had to judge a submission more or less 'as is'; thus some submissions were rejected even though their faults could have been overcome in a real revision cycle (i.e., as found with journals). As well, the conference itself imposes severe constraints, as there are only so many papers that can fit within its current three track structure. Bottom line: the committee arrived at a standard of what constituted a good Paper or Note, and accepted only submissions judged to adhere to that standard. There is a debate on whether CSCW should be more permissive in how it accepts Papers and Notes, especially in light of the rising submission rate and overall submission quality. One step that the community is currently working toward is holding the CSCW conference every year. This might relieve some of the backlog generated by the current biennial cycle, and would also provide more frequent occasions for the community to gather and foster more collaboration.},

These submissions addressed a wide range of applications domains, including: healthcare, rural areas, online gaming, mobile computing, preschool, colleges, community workers, and global software development. We think you will be impressed with the final line-up of 58 submissions that made it into CSCW 2011. Full Papers (10 pages) and Notes (4 pages) submissions were reviewed using the same process by the same Program Committee (PC). Much of our work is multidisciplinary and a wide range of expertise is needed in the overseeing program committee to ensure all submissions are fairly reviewed. Therefore, our committee consisted of established and rising researchers as well as practitioners from academia, corporate research laboratories, and consultancies. It included computer scientists, psychologists, designers, engineers, sociologists and linguists. Among them, they had deep knowledge of various domains ranging from game design to science and technology studies, applied to the critical analysis and design of technologies for work and for leisure, used on the move with mobile devices or at a desk on personal computers. We had 40 Associate Chairs (ACs) as the CSCW 2011 PC evaluating the 264 submissions -- 188 full papers and 76 notes. In order to simultaneously front-load some of the PC meeting work and increase the diversity of reviews for each submission, we modified the traditional AC allocation process: each submission was assigned a primary AC (1AC) as well as a secondary AC (2AC) up front. The 1AC and 2AC were allowed to consider desk rejection if there were technical problems with a submission (e.g. formatting) or if it was completely out of scope for the conference. Desk rejection had to be based on agreement between the two ACs and the PC chairs -- otherwise, the submission went into the review process. The 1AC and 2AC worked together to find a minimum of three external reviewers. Following submission of the external reviews, the ACs initiated a discussion among the reviewers, if needed, to resolve conflicting views. The 1ACs and 2ACs then completed a metareview summarizing the reviews and provided detailed comments with a recommendation for acceptance, rejection, and/or a request for additional input from the authors, which the authors were encouraged to provide through a rebuttal procedure. Following this, the reviewers and ACs were asked to consider the authors rebuttal and change their review and/or score if the rebuttal gave reasons to do so. In early November 2010, the PC met for 2 days in Mountain View, California. Submissions without a single positive review were flagged for automatic rejection, leaving 133 submissions to discuss. All had to be presented by their ACs: we did not auto-accept submissions. While the ACs who read the submission made the final recommendation, the decision process was highly visible so that all of the 40 program committee attendees could apply the same standards to their own decisions. ACs were encouraged to discuss at the committee meeting any submission that they thought had merit including those not originally assigned to them or for which they had acted as a 2AC. As a result, many more submissions were discussed than were finally accepted. In total, the PC and 1,021 external reviewers spent countless hours providing feedback to the authors. After this rigorous process, a total of 58 submissions - 45 full papers and 13 notes -- were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 22%. A subcommittee discussed and selected 21 of the 58 accepted submissions to be considered for special recognition in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. SIGCHI rules require that only 5% of submissions be nominated for best paper, with only 1% eventually getting the award. The aforementioned list of 21 accepted submissions was therefore reduced to 10 papers and 4 notes for consideration. Of these, 2 papers and 1 note were recognized as Best of CSCW 2011, while the remaining were awarded an honorable mention. These submissions are marked with small icons in the table of contents.},

However, no clear understanding of what constitutes such a 'critical mass' exists and too few quantitative studies have been conducted into the relationship between initial online community interaction and its longer term success to draw any conclusions. In this paper we start to address this gap through a large-scale study of the relationship between IRC chat channel survival and initial chat channel community interactions. A sample 282 chat channel births was used for survival analysis which explored the relationship between the overall user activity in each channel at its inception and the channel's life expectancy. Significant relationships were observed between online community lifespan and critical mass measures: 1) message volume, 2) user population heterogeneity and 3) production functions. The results lend support to the Critical Mass Theory of collective action.},

A survey of 132 participants assessed three types of warrants (the use of a real name, a photo, and the presence of real-world acquaintances) in five different media: IM, Forums, Chat, Social Networking Sites (SNS) and Email. The effect of warrants on lies about demographic information (e.g., age, gender, education, etc.), one's interests (e.g., religion, music preferences, etc.), and the seriousness of lies was assessed. Overall, deception was observed most frequently in Chat and least often in SNS and Email. The relationship between warrants and deception was negative and linear, with warrants suppressing the frequency and seriousness of deception regardless of medium, although real-world acquaintances were especially powerful in constraining deception in SNS and emails.},

One of the most widely used forms of online production is the wiki, which has been used in domains ranging from science to education to enterprise. We examined the development of and interactions between coordination and conflict in a sample of 6811 wiki production groups. We investigated the influence of four coordination mechanisms: intra-article communication, inter-user communication, concentration of workgroup structure, and policy and procedures. We also examined the growth of conflict, finding the density of users in an information space to be a significant predictor. Finally, we analyzed the effectiveness of the four coordination mechanisms on managing conflict, finding differences in how each scaled to large numbers of contributors. Our results suggest that coordination mechanisms effective for managing conflict are not always the same as those effective for managing task quality, and that designers must take into account the social benefits of coordination mechanisms in addition to their production benefits.},

We extend prior work to study the effect of shared information on collaboration. We analyzed the success and discussion process of remote pairs trying to identify a serial killer in multiple crime cases. Each partner had half of the evidence, or each partner had all the available evidence. Pairs also used one of three tools: spreadsheet only (control condition), unshared visualizations, or shared visualization. Visualizations improved analysis over the control condition but this improvement depended on how much evidence each partner had. When each partner possessed all the evidence with visualizations, discussion flagged and pairs showed evidence of more confirmation bias. They discussed fewer hypotheses and persisted on the wrong hypothesis. We discuss the possible reasons for this phenomenon and implications for design of remote collaboration systems to incorporate awareness of intermediate processes important to collaborative success.},

@inproceedings{Shao:2010:STA:1718918.1718949,
 abstract = {Operational transformation (OT) is a promising technique for supporting collaboration using mobile devices because it allows users to work on local data replicas even in a disconnected mode. However, as work goes mobile, a large number of operations may accumulate, defying the capacity of current OT algorithms that are mostly designed for real-time group editing. Since their assumption is that operations are propagated frequently, they generally only address how to integrate one remote operation at a time. As a consequence, most algorithms take O(|H|2) to integrate one operation and thus O(|H|3) to integrate a long sequence, where H is the operation history. This paper proposes a novel algorithm that provides optimized transformation of long sequences, improving the time complexity to O(|H|). Our experiments will show that it takes 59 minutes in a recent algorithm versus 1.5 seconds in this work to integrate two long sequences on a mobile device. The performance improvement is critical towards achieving desired responsiveness and group productivity in a class of mobile collaborative applications.},

We suggest a classification of these sources into three categories: people, things, and places. Lists of similar people returned by the nine sources are found to be highly different from each other as well as from the list of people the user is familiar with, suggesting that aggregation of sources may be valuable. Evaluation of the sources and their aggregates points at their usefulness across different scenarios, such as information discovery and expertise location, and also highlights sources and aggregates that are particularly valuable for inferring user similarity.},

This qualitative research builds on recent research in which we quantitatively demonstrate the growing prevalence of such software in recent years. Using trace ethnography, we show how these often-unofficial technologies have fundamentally transformed the nature of editing and administration in Wikipedia. Specifically, we analyze "vandal fighting" as an epistemic process of distributed cognition, highlighting the role of non-human actors in enabling a decentralized activity of collective intelligence. In all, this case shows that software programs are used for more than enforcing policies and standards. These tools enable coordinated yet decentralized action, independent of the specific norms currently in force.},

In contrast, no significant benefits were found when mono audio was replaced by spatialized audio. The results of this work are important in that they provide strong evidence for continued exploration of spatialized video, and also suggest that the benefits of spatialized audio may have less of an impact when video is also spatialized.},

We analyze nearly 100,000 Amazon.com reviews for signs of repetition and find that roughly 10-15% of reviews substantially resemble previous ones. Using these algorithmically-identified reviews as centerpieces for discussion, we interviewed reviewers to understand their motives. An overwhelming number of reviews partially explains deja reviews, but deeper factors revolving around an individual's status in the community are also at work. The paper concludes by introducing a new idea inspired by our findings: a self-aware community that nudges members toward community-wide goals.},

Results show that textual information elicits the highest ratings of trustworthiness, and that the addition of a photograph decreases daters' perceived trustworthiness. However, the accuracy of trustworthiness impressions is low regardless of the type of information available, because of a truth bias. Results are discussed in terms of (1) hyperpersonal impression formation and the nature of truth bias; and (2) practical implications for building trustworthiness online.},

We involved 10 families in recording 'sonic souvenirs' of their holidays. They shared and discussed their collections on their return. We compared these sounds with their photo taking activities and reminiscences. Both sounds and pictures triggered active collaborative reminiscing, and attempts to capture iconic representations of events. However sounds differed from photos in that they were more varied, familial and creative. Further, they often expressed the negative or mundane in order to be 'true to life', and were harder to interpret than photos. Finally we saw little use of pure explanatory narrative. We reflect on the relations between sound and family memory and propose new designs on the basis of our findings, to better support the sharing and manipulation of social sounds.},

I report on the cultural practices of hardcore gaming that have revolved around SF4. SF4's release on both the console (which enables fighting others online) and the arcade has engendered a new set of challenges in constructing what it means to be competitive and legitimate in the world of head-to-head fighting games.

Results showed that users view notifications as a mechanism to provide passive awareness rather than a trigger to switch tasks. Turing off notifications cause some users to self interrupt more to explicitly monitor email arrival, while others appear to be able to better focus on their tasks.

In a lab study, we evaluated people's understanding of meetings they had partly missed, by asking questions about meeting content. We tested whether providing Catchup gist overcomes the potential disadvantage that people must join even later - because catching up takes time. Catchup users understood meetings 70% better than controls who simply joined late. They were more confident of their understanding and indicated a positive attitude towards the tool.

Through a 3-month study of 161 deliberations over whether a news item should appear on Wikipedia's front page, we demonstrate that elite users fulfill a unique gatekeeping role that permits them to leverage their community position to block the promotion of inappropriate items. However, these elite users are unable to promote their supported news items more effectively than other types of editors. These findings suggest that "one-sided gatekeeping" may reflect a crucial stasis in social media where the community has to balance the experience of its elite users while encouraging contributions from non-elite users.},

 abstract = {This paper considers a subset of the computer-mediated communication (CMC) that took place during the flooding of the Red River Valley in the US and Canada in March and April 2009. Focusing on the use of Twitter, a microblogging service, we identified mechanisms of information production, distribution, and organization. The Red River event resulted in a rapid generation of Twitter communications by numerous sources using a variety of communications forms, including autobiographical and mainstream media reporting, among other types. We examine the social life of microblogged information, identifying generative, synthetic, derivative and innovative properties that sustain the broader system of interaction. The landscape of Twitter is such that the production of new information is supported through derivative activities of directing, relaying, synthesizing, and redistributing, and is additionally complemented by socio-technical innovation. These activities comprise self-organization of information.},

 abstract = {Socialization of newcomers is critical both for conventional groups. It helps groups perform effectively and the newcomers develop commitment. However, little empirical research has investigated the impact of specific socialization tactics on newcomers' commitment to online groups. We examined WikiProjects, subgroups in Wikipedia organized around working on common topics or tasks. In study 1, we identified the seven socialization tactics used most frequently: invitations to join, welcome messages, requests to work on project-related tasks, offers of assistance, positive feedback on a new member's work, constructive criticism, and personal-related comments. In study 2, we examined their impact on newcomers' commitment to the project. Whereas most newcomers contributed fewer edits over time, the declines were slowed or reversed for those socialized with welcome messages, assistance, and constructive criticism. In contrast, invitations led to steeper declines in edits. These results suggest that different socialization tactics play different roles in socializing new members in online groups compared to offline ones.},

 abstract = {The success of Wikipedia as a large-scale collaborative effort has spurred researchers to examine the motivations and behaviors of Wikipedia's participants. However, this research has tended to focus on active involvement rather than more common forms of participation such as reading. In this paper we argue that Wikipedia's readers should not all be characterized as free-riders -- individuals who knowingly choose to take advantage of others' effort. Furthermore, we illustrate how readers provide a valuable service to Wikipedia. Finally, we use the notion of legitimate peripheral participation to argue that reading is a gateway activity through which newcomers learn about Wikipedia. We find support for our arguments in the results of a survey of Wikipedia usage and knowledge. Implications for future research and design are discussed.},

 abstract = {Welcome to the 2010 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work! We hope that this conference will be a place to hear exciting talks about the latest in CSCW research, an opportunity to learn new things, and a chance to connect with friends in the community. We are pleased to see such a strong and diverse program at this year's conference. We have a mix of research areas represented -- some that are traditionally part of our community, and several that have not been frequently seen at CSCW. There are sessions to suit every taste: from collaborative software development, healthcare, and groupware technologies, to studies of Wikipedia, family communications, games, and volunteering. We are particularly interested in a new kind of forum at the conference this year -- the 'CSCW Horizon' -- which will present novel and challenging ideas, and will do so in a more interactive fashion than standard paper sessions. The program is an exciting and topical mix of cutting-edge research and thought in CSCW. A major change for CSCW beginning this year is our move from being a biennial to an annual conference. This has meant a change in the time of the conference (from November to February), and subsequent changes in all of our normal deadlines and procedures. Despite these changes, the community has responded with enormous enthusiasm, and we look forward to the future of yearly meetings under the ACM CSCW banner.},

 abstract = {The defining characteristics of autism, including difficulty with nonverbal cues and need for structure, and the defining characteristics of computer-mediated communication (CMC), including reduction of extraneous cues and structured exchange, suggest the two would be an ideal match. Interviews and observations of 16 adults on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum reveal that many seek greater social connectedness and take advantage of interest-based online communities to foster successful, supportive relationships. However, CMC intensifies problems of trust, disclosure, inflexible thinking, and perspective-taking, making it difficult for some to maintain relationships. Interventions in the form of information visualization and CMC-specific social skills training are presented. Intervention considerations and participatory design opportunities are discussed.},

This difference makes them more likely than other students to be sensitive to issues of impression management and use of social network sites (SNSs). In this paper, we show how student athletes at a large university engage with the social network site Facebook compared with their fellow students, including differences in the size of their networks, reported uses of the site, and perceptions about their audience. This work shows that while student athletes have a higher anticipation of being watched, they have similar uses and concerns compared to other students.},

We use system data and message content from over 350 Twitter users, applying human coding and quantitative analysis to provide a deeper understanding of the activity of individuals on the Twitter network. In particular, we develop a content-based categorization of the type of messages posted by Twitter users, based on which we examine users' activity. Our analysis shows two common types of user behavior in terms of the content of the posted messages, and exposes differences between users in respect to these activities.},

 abstract = {We present a field study of TellTable, a new storytelling system designed to support creativity and collaboration amongst children. The application was deployed on a multi-touch interactive table in the library of a primary school, where children could use it to create characters and scenery based on elements of the physical world (captured through photography) as well as through drawing. These could then be used to record a story which could be played back. TellTable allowed children to collaborate in devising stories that mixed the physical and the digital in creative ways and that could include themselves as characters. Additionally, the field deployment illustrated how children took inspiration from one another's stories, how they planned elements of their own tales before using the technology, and how the fact that stories could be accessed in the library led some to become well-known and popular within the school community. The real story here, we argue, needs to take into account all that happens within the wider context of use of this system.},
