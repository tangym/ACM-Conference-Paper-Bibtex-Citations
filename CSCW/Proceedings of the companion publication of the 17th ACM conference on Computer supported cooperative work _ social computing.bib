@proceedings{Bruckman:2013:2441776,
 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2013 ACM Computer Supported Cooperative Work -- CSCW'13. This year's conference continues its tradition of being the premier forum for research on online collaboration, social computing, and social media studies. CSCW meets a wide range of research interests, from technical communication systems building to ethnographic studies of computer-mediated collaboration in the wild. The mission of the conference is to share novel research in these domains of interest in order to advance the state of the art in CSCW. CSCW is committed to innovation in all aspects of research. This year's conference marks the second year in which the conference used a revision cycle in the paper reviewing process. The goal of this process is to increase quality of accepted papers and grow the program to better reflect the richness of our field. 390 paper submissions were received, 139 of which were accepted for publication after going through two rigorous review cycles. This year also marks the first year in which page length limits and the Papers/Notes distinction were eliminated, resulting in an overall modest increase in the length of papers. In all, the changes to the authoring and reviewing process have generated more papers of higher quality. CSCW '13 also has tracks for posters, demos, videos, workshops, panels, and a doctoral consortium, all of which are seeing tremendous participation. The workshops alone, for instance, have attracted almost 150 participants. For the first time, CSCW this year will have an open format "unconference" track where attendees can explore ideas in greater depth. We will also have a fitness track to start each day with some collaborative healthy activity. In addition to the stellar technical program, CSCW'13 hosts two exciting keynote speakers, Ron Burt and Jascha Franklin-Hodge. Ron will open the conference with a discussion of his research on volatility and advantage in networks, while Jascha will close the conference with an in-thetrenches look at modern digital democracy. Other highlights outside the papers program include a posters and videos reception and the main conference reception, both of which should provide time to connect with your fellow CSCW researchers.},

One values lever that is often unnoticed is that of white nationalist appropriation. White Nationalists are often "othered" as extremists which obfuscates rhetoric around racism. In return, levers about race are only pulled during the design process if it is overt in its racial sensitivity. We often refer to this as political correctness or more appropriately "racism without racists [1]." This research represents one case study of the unintended white nationalist appropriation of content within The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. By building on a discussion originated by white nationalists, we hope to pull a values lever that approaches multi-cultural and multi-national content that doesn't focus on racism as an extremist activity but an unintended consequence of well-intended design.},

A body of recent works demonstrated how stress is reflected in individual's everyday behavior, and can be measured by sensors. Studies show that many of these behaviors are socially constructed. However, little has been done to find the stressors in one's social network and help one cope accordingly. We propose here a system to find the stress network around an individual that contributes to her stress status. Furthermore, we also present a strategy for coping by exploiting this stress network. We argue that our proposed design can benefit individuals by making them more stress-resilient over time by exploiting their social bonds.},

Inspired by concepts such as collective intelligence, citizen science, citizen journalism and crowdsourcing, diverse types of organisations are aiming to increase engagement with the public, collect localised knowledge, or leverage human cognition and creativity. In supporting these approaches, organisations are often provoked to make their data and processes more open, and to be inclusive of differing motivations and perspectives from inside and outside the organisation. In doing so, they raise new questions for both designers and organisations. For example how are "official" and "unofficial" information sources combined or hosted, mediated, or considered reliable? Does the role of the professional change through greater involvement of amateurs? How are the motivations of members of the public harnessed for mutual benefit? This workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to address those questions from different perspectives.},

In keeping with previous years, CSCW 2014 presents premier research on computer-mediated collaboration, social computing, and social media, from the design of technical systems for collaboration to ethnographic studies of use in the wild. The mission of the conference is to share the novel research that will advance the state of our art. The conference program embraces a variety of perspectives, reflecting how collaboration permeates different aspects of people's work, social, and civic lives. This diversity of perspectives is mirrored by geographic diversity among contributors. The CSCW 2014 program retains the richly articulated structure of previous conferences in this series including a robust program of workshops, papers, panels, demonstrations, videos, and interactive posters. This year, we also introduce CSCWhat's Next, a selection of forward-looking research-in-progress papers intended to foster discussion. Another innovation this year is the option for demos, videos and poster presenters to give short talks about their work immediately preceding Monday night's reception. Special highlights this year include our opening plenary talk, "Making a Difference In and Through Playful Design," by Mary Flanagan of Dartmouth University and our closing plenary, "Next Generation Humanitarian Computing," by Patrick Meier of Qatar Computing Research Institute. We will also present the inaugural CSCW Lasting Impact Award to Jonathan Grudin for his groundbreaking 1988 paper "Why CSCW applications fail: Problems in the design and evaluation of organizational interfaces." Interest in CSCW'14 is as high as ever, including a record number of paper submissions.

We predict the success rate of 2,344 ideas for 12 different design challenges in a collaborative Web-based innovation platform based on their cited sources' conceptual distance from the target domain (measured using probabilistic topic modeling of the ideas). Surprisingly, we find that innovators who cite conceptually near sources of inspiration achieve a higher success rate than those who prefer far sources.

In Europe, especial attention has been dedicated to informal caregivers for the past few years, due to indicators showing that more than 80% of the care for frail and old people, one of the major groups of care receivers in the region, is informally provided by family members and friends.

 abstract = {We warmly welcome you to Baltimore, Maryland, USA, for the 2014 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! In keeping with previous years, CSCW 2014 presents premier research on computer-mediated collaboration, social computing, and social media, from the design of technical systems for collaboration to ethnographic studies of use in the wild. The mission of the conference is to share the novel research that will advance the state of our art. The conference program embraces a variety of perspectives, reflecting how collaboration permeates different aspects of people's work, social, and civic lives. This diversity of perspectives is mirrored by geographic diversity among contributors. The CSCW 2014 program retains the richly articulated structure of previous conferences in this series including a robust program of workshops, papers, panels, demonstrations, videos, and interactive posters. This year, we also introduce CSCWhat's Next, a selection of forward-looking research-in-progress papers intended to foster discussion. Another innovation this year is the option for demos, videos and poster presenters to give short talks about their work immediately preceding Monday night's reception. Special highlights this year include our opening plenary talk, "Making a Difference In and Through Playful Design," by Mary Flanagan of Dartmouth University and our closing plenary, "Next Generation Humanitarian Computing," by Patrick Meier of Qatar Computing Research Institute. We will also present the inaugural CSCW Lasting Impact Award to Jonathan Grudin for his groundbreaking 1988 paper "Why CSCW applications fail: Problems in the design and evaluation of organizational interfaces." Interest in CSCW'14 is as high as ever, including a record number of paper submissions. The welcome message from our technical program chairs highlights the modifications to the review process this year as we continue to optimize our new revise and resubmit system.},

Urban social norms such as "civil inattention" --- a deliberate display of unwillingness to become more familiar with strangers --- discourage social interactions among strangers. While these norms help reduce anxiety or fear in overcrowded urban centers they hinder meaningful social interactions in public spaces (coffee shops, museums, and malls, etc.) and events (conferences, galas, etc.) where such interactions should occur. This paper describes CommonTies, a simple technological nudge that managers of interaction spaces and organizers of social events can use to leverage contextual information to encourage social interactions among strangers.},

We hypothesized that the social system of GitHub users was bound by system interactions such that contributing to similar code repositories would lead to users following one another on GitHub or vice versa. Using a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) correlation, however, only a weak correlation among followship and production activities (code, issue, and wiki contributions) was found. Survey with GitHub users revealed an ecosystem on the Internet for software developers, which includes many platforms, such as Forrst, Twitter, and Hacker News, among others. Developers make social introductions and other interactions on these platforms and engage with one anther on GitHub. Due to these preliminary findings, we describe GitHub as a part of a larger ecosystem of developer interactions.},

We include a variety of resources such as data, software, materials and specimens, workflows, technical know-how, clinical and laboratory protocols, and algorithms.

 abstract = {The evolving philosophies, methods, and products of CSCW design research are more collaborative and value-active than ever. Researchers and participants may co-construct designs, thus sharing power; they may share intimate life stories over design probes, thus pushing socio-cultural boundaries; they may seek personal fulfillment through the products or the process. How do these experiences affect researcher and co-creator identity in the moment of co-work? How do these changes reconfigure other relationships and encounters? This workshop invites discussants from across disciplines to consider phenomenological aspects of identity-making and to unpack ethical dilemmas that arise when we appreciate the potential for design research itself to significantly harm or help participants. At stake are CSCW policies, best practices, and collective understandings of what it means to be a design researcher.},

Teens tend to follow more users and increase friendships over time. They tend to friend individuals online who they already know offline. Teenagers also use Twitter as a news media and form supportive and dense communities. These results shed new light on the attributes of teenage communities. We can then utilize these ideas to find solutions to emerging problems involving the massive use of social media. For example, Twitter can be used as a positive tool for the prevention of bad habits among teens.},

We developed a simple goal achievement application, Achieve, to examine the effects of progress logging and social feedback on goal completion. Results of an in-progress study suggest that both progress logging and social feedback had positive effects on goal completion. However, surprisingly, social feedback has no significant advantage over progress logging. Further, participants who gave and received social feedback had a higher level of annoyance toward the study. We discuss possible reasons for this and propose insights for adding social components to goal achievement systems.},
