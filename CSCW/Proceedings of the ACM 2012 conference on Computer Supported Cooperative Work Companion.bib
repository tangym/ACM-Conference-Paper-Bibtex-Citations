In an attempt to address hidden profiles problem in computer-mediated communication, this paper presents a work-in-progress tool, Rationale Flower that visualizes the rationales exchanged through instant messaging in an online group decision making activity. In this study, a rationale is a member's explanation of why a piece of information should be brought to the group discussion.

Several studies have already pointed out that micro-blogging systems have shown potential advantages in emergency situations, but it remains unclear how people use them. This paper presents a case study of how people used Twitter after the Great East Japan Earthquake. First, we gathered tweets immediately after the earthquake and analyzed various factors, including locations. The results revealed two findings: (1) people in the disaster area tend to directly communicate with each other (reply-based tweet). On the other hand,(2) people in the other area prefer spread the information from the disaster area by using Re-tweet.},

In this workshop, we will explore: 1) the role that other people play in an individual's PIM in a variety of collaborative and sharing contexts, and 2) the effects that web and cloud-based services are having on PIM practices. We focus on the challenges users face in an evolving communication ecology when sharing and exposing personal information in a variety of situations.},

We model collaboration as driven by individual-centered and group-centered rules. Context sharing is core to this process, but reveals difficult in the case of distant tangible communication. We propose to model collaboration as a trace-based process in which tangible object traces are stored, analyzed, enriched and shared. We draw on a normative multi-agent approach in which explicit norms are meant to operate at various levels, from the physical to the social level. These norms do not act as a prerequisite, or as a way to place a priori constraints on action. Rather, they result in a set of signs situating the activity. Such design offers novel ways for embedding activity theory in the current trend of socio-physical computing.},

 abstract = {Emotion expression in text-based instant messaging (IM) has received little empirical scrutiny. The emotional message cues people use to express their different emotions in IM communication and how their personality traits affect those cues are the main focus of this study. Results of a preliminary study in IM suggest that in stressful situations people apply significantly fewer vocal spelling emotional cues than in non-stressful situations. There is also a significant relationship between conscientiousness as a personality trait and use of lexical surrogate emotional cues in this type of communication. Our proposed study expands upon preliminary data to uncover more significant differences among the emotional message cues people use to express different emotions in IM, including the role of relevant personality traits. Identifying how users express emotions in IM assists researchers and designers in focusing on the users' emotional needs and results in the improvement of emotional communication strategies in IM.},

@proceedings{Poltrock:2012:2141512,
 abstract = {Constraint can spur creativity. Approaching the 26th anniversary of the CSCW conference, we were asked to move the submission deadline two months earlier to reduce the reviewing conflict with CHI 2012. In response, we used the additional time to innovate and to increase participation while maintaining or increasing quality, by allowing authors to revise and resubmit their papers and notes. Conference attendees and proceedings readers will ultimately assess the outcome, but overall the feedback from associate chairs, reviewers and authors has been very positive. Submissions increased 57% from CSCW 2011 to a record 290 papers and 125 notes. We increased the program committee to 67 associate chairs (ACs) to handle them; 21 were women and 20 were from outside North America. They comprised representatives from computer science, social media and social networks, psychology, anthropology, software engineering, management, and design. Fifty were from universities. Our process most resembled a journal special issue, with a submission deadline, a team of four reviewers, and one revision cycle under a firm time constraint (in this case five weeks). Each submission was assigned to two committee members, designated AC-Coordinator and ACReviewer. Each AC assigned one external reviewer. In the first round, each paper or note was blind-reviewed by the AC-Reviewer and the two external reviewers. Reviewers assessed the likelihood that it could be revised within one month to be acceptable. Based on the outcomes, submissions were considered 'conditional accept' (CA, 8.7%), 'revise=resubmit' (RR, 46.5%) or 'reject' (44.8%). In general, papers that received one or more positive assessments were offered the opportunity to revise. Papers that had no positive assessment in the first round were rejected. We based this decision on an analysis of CSCW 2011 data, which revealed that submissions that did not get an advocate in the initial reviewing had 0% chance of acceptance. Sixty percent of CSCW 2011 submissions had no advocate, compared to 45% of CSCW 2012 submissions. The difference is that the CSCW 2012 submissions had a month in which they could be improved. By immediately rejecting the 45% that had no chance, we streamlined and focused the process, and reduced the number of reviews per submission despite the revision cycle. The AC Coordinator relied on the reviews in providing written guidance to authors on how to revise RRs. Authors of RR and CA submissions had five weeks to prepare a revision and an explanation of how they had addressed reviewer concerns. Resubmissions of RRs underwent a full second review from the same four-reviewer team; most CAs were checked by just one AC. Reviewing teams were strongly encouraged to resolve decisions prior to the program committee meeting and indeed, only 6% of initial submissions had to be discussed in the meeting. The program committee split into two subgroups followed by a plenary session to make the final decisions. 127 papers and 37 notes, 39.5% of initial submissions, reached acceptable quality through revision. This is almost twice the number presented in any previous CSCW, in part due to record submissions. ACs and reviewers nominated papers and notes for consideration for Best Paper awards; 4 were selected, with 17 awarded Honorable Mention. The accepted work represents diverse topics. Relatively new topics for CSCW include crowdsourcing, civic engagement, and social media; more traditional CSCW topics include distributed work, coordination, ethnography, and collaborative software development. This collaborative effort was an example of computer supported cooperative work. The entire CSCW community provided input throughout the process-many ideas and changes came from outside of the committee. Committee members had to adapt to new ways of working. Our analysis indicates that the work required of reviewers and associate chairs did not exceed that of past years, and authors benefited from two rounds of feedback from committed ACs and reviewers. Our goal was to maintain a high quality threshold while enabling more papers to reach that threshold. We believe there are many benefits to a review process with more opportunity for constructive interaction between reviewers and authors. Authors benefit by learning more about the CSCW culture, and by producing papers that are better than they could have produced on their own. Reviewers benefit by seeing their work lead to improved papers. The community benefits, because more of its members are successful at producing high quality research each year. As a community, we must consider new ways to assess conference quality-when a larger volume of high quality work is produced, older metrics no longer hold. Considering the fraction of submitted work that is of low quality to be a measure of conference quality is backwards. We need new measures of process quality and the resulting quality of accepted work. Through continued innovation, CSCW will remain the top venue for leading edge research on collaboration and technology. As with any new process, mistakes were made and much was learned. We look forward to participating as community members in ongoing innovation. The other technical tracks contribute immeasurably to the program. A record number of interactive posters will be presented. The 14 workshops drew a remarkable number of submissions. With demos, horizon, panels, videos, special sessions, and three plenary keynotes, CSCW 2012 is a great start to the second quarter-century of the CSCW conference.},

Above that User Experience (UX) factors such as trust and perceived safety have a main influence on the type of front-seat passenger assistance and level of collaboration. Based on these observations we present a design approach for collaborative navigation devices that can be used to inform future research and practical applications in automobile collaboration.},

 abstract = {Collaborative technologies increasingly permeate our everyday lives. Mixed reality games use these technologies to entertain, motivate, educate, and inspire. We understand mixed reality games as goal-directed, structured play experiences that are not fully contained by virtual or physical worlds. They transform existing technologies, relationships, and places into platforms for gameplay. While the design of mixed reality games has received increasing attention across multiple disciplines, a focus on the collaborative potential of mixed reality formats, such as augmented and alternate reality games, has been lacking. We believe the CSCW community can play an essential and unique role in examining and designing the next generation of mixed reality games and technologies that support them. To this end, we seek to bring together researchers, designers, and players to advance an integrated mixed reality games' research canon and outline key opportunities and challenges for future research and development.},

We suggest that when patient trajectories progress according to plan, information needs of staff is minimal and when variations occur, the information need increases dramatically. In order to provide better support for such variations, awareness-support systems need to inform colleagues and other stakeholders about the deviations from the plan. Additionally, end-users should have the option to switch between information-sparse and information-rich computer support.},

@proceedings{Poltrock:2012:2145204,
 abstract = {Constraint can spur creativity. Approaching the 26th anniversary of the CSCW conference, we were asked to move the submission deadline two months earlier to reduce the reviewing conflict with CHI 2012. In response, we used the additional time to innovate and to increase participation while maintaining or increasing quality, by allowing authors to revise and resubmit their papers and notes. Conference attendees and proceedings readers will ultimately assess the outcome, but overall the feedback from associate chairs, reviewers and authors has been very positive. Submissions increased 57% from CSCW 2011 to a record 290 papers and 125 notes. We increased the program committee to 67 associate chairs (ACs) to handle them; 21 were women and 20 were from outside North America. They comprised representatives from computer science, social media and social networks, psychology, anthropology, software engineering, management, and design. Fifty were from universities. Our process most resembled a journal special issue, with a submission deadline, a team of four reviewers, and one revision cycle under a firm time constraint (in this case five weeks). Each submission was assigned to two committee members, designated AC-Coordinator and ACReviewer. Each AC assigned one external reviewer. In the first round, each paper or note was blind-reviewed by the AC-Reviewer and the two external reviewers. Reviewers assessed the likelihood that it could be revised within one month to be acceptable. Based on the outcomes, submissions were considered 'conditional accept' (CA, 8.7%), 'revise=resubmit' (RR, 46.5%) or 'reject' (44.8%). In general, papers that received one or more positive assessments were offered the opportunity to revise. Papers that had no positive assessment in the first round were rejected. We based this decision on an analysis of CSCW 2011 data, which revealed that submissions that did not get an advocate in the initial reviewing had 0% chance of acceptance. Sixty percent of CSCW 2011 submissions had no advocate, compared to 45% of CSCW 2012 submissions. The difference is that the CSCW 2012 submissions had a month in which they could be improved. By immediately rejecting the 45% that had no chance, we streamlined and focused the process, and reduced the number of reviews per submission despite the revision cycle. The AC Coordinator relied on the reviews in providing written guidance to authors on how to revise RRs. Authors of RR and CA submissions had five weeks to prepare a revision and an explanation of how they had addressed reviewer concerns. Resubmissions of RRs underwent a full second review from the same four-reviewer team; most CAs were checked by just one AC. Reviewing teams were strongly encouraged to resolve decisions prior to the program committee meeting and indeed, only 6% of initial submissions had to be discussed in the meeting. The program committee split into two subgroups followed by a plenary session to make the final decisions. 127 papers and 37 notes, 39.5% of initial submissions, reached acceptable quality through revision. This is almost twice the number presented in any previous CSCW, in part due to record submissions. ACs and reviewers nominated papers and notes for consideration for Best Paper awards; 4 were selected, with 17 awarded Honorable Mention. The accepted work represents diverse topics. Relatively new topics for CSCW include crowdsourcing, civic engagement, and social media; more traditional CSCW topics include distributed work, coordination, ethnography, and collaborative software development. This collaborative effort was an example of computer supported cooperative work. The entire CSCW community provided input throughout the process-many ideas and changes came from outside of the committee. Committee members had to adapt to new ways of working. Our analysis indicates that the work required of reviewers and associate chairs did not exceed that of past years, and authors benefited from two rounds of feedback from committed ACs and reviewers. Our goal was to maintain a high quality threshold while enabling more papers to reach that threshold. We believe there are many benefits to a review process with more opportunity for constructive interaction between reviewers and authors. Authors benefit by learning more about the CSCW culture, and by producing papers that are better than they could have produced on their own. Reviewers benefit by seeing their work lead to improved papers. The community benefits, because more of its members are successful at producing high quality research each year. As a community, we must consider new ways to assess conference quality-when a larger volume of high quality work is produced, older metrics no longer hold. Considering the fraction of submitted work that is of low quality to be a measure of conference quality is backwards. We need new measures of process quality and the resulting quality of accepted work. Through continued innovation, CSCW will remain the top venue for leading edge research on collaboration and technology. As with any new process, mistakes were made and much was learned. We look forward to participating as community members in ongoing innovation. The other technical tracks contribute immeasurably to the program. A record number of interactive posters will be presented. The 14 workshops drew a remarkable number of submissions. With demos, horizon, panels, videos, special sessions, and three plenary keynotes, CSCW 2012 is a great start to the second quarter-century of the CSCW conference.},

@proceedings{Hinds:2011:1958824,
 abstract = {CSCW is now an annual conference and, for the first time ever, it is taking place outside of North America -- this year in China. Despite this change in timing and location, we are pleased to report that the number of submissions for 2011 was in the same range as last year. Moreover, following the United States, China was the second largest contributing nation with 22 submissions. In total, we received 264 papers and notes. These ranged across many different areas, including: designs for new communication and collaboration applications; new interaction techniques for novel hardware like tabletops and public displays; studies of groupware deployment and use, especially in the realm of new social media like micro-blogging and social networking sites; and methods for analyzing social interaction. These submissions addressed a wide range of applications domains, including: healthcare, rural areas, online gaming, mobile computing, preschool, colleges, community workers, and global software development. We think you will be impressed with the final line-up of 58 submissions that made it into CSCW 2011. Full Papers (10 pages) and Notes (4 pages) submissions were reviewed using the same process by the same Program Committee (PC). Much of our work is multidisciplinary and a wide range of expertise is needed in the overseeing program committee to ensure all submissions are fairly reviewed. Therefore, our committee consisted of established and rising researchers as well as practitioners from academia, corporate research laboratories, and consultancies. It included computer scientists, psychologists, designers, engineers, sociologists and linguists. Among them, they had deep knowledge of various domains ranging from game design to science and technology studies, applied to the critical analysis and design of technologies for work and for leisure, used on the move with mobile devices or at a desk on personal computers. We had 40 Associate Chairs (ACs) as the CSCW 2011 PC evaluating the 264 submissions -- 188 full papers and 76 notes. In order to simultaneously front-load some of the PC meeting work and increase the diversity of reviews for each submission, we modified the traditional AC allocation process: each submission was assigned a primary AC (1AC) as well as a secondary AC (2AC) up front. The 1AC and 2AC were allowed to consider desk rejection if there were technical problems with a submission (e.g. formatting) or if it was completely out of scope for the conference. Desk rejection had to be based on agreement between the two ACs and the PC chairs -- otherwise, the submission went into the review process. The 1AC and 2AC worked together to find a minimum of three external reviewers. Following submission of the external reviews, the ACs initiated a discussion among the reviewers, if needed, to resolve conflicting views. The 1ACs and 2ACs then completed a metareview summarizing the reviews and provided detailed comments with a recommendation for acceptance, rejection, and/or a request for additional input from the authors, which the authors were encouraged to provide through a rebuttal procedure. Following this, the reviewers and ACs were asked to consider the authors rebuttal and change their review and/or score if the rebuttal gave reasons to do so. In early November 2010, the PC met for 2 days in Mountain View, California. Submissions without a single positive review were flagged for automatic rejection, leaving 133 submissions to discuss. All had to be presented by their ACs: we did not auto-accept submissions. While the ACs who read the submission made the final recommendation, the decision process was highly visible so that all of the 40 program committee attendees could apply the same standards to their own decisions. ACs were encouraged to discuss at the committee meeting any submission that they thought had merit including those not originally assigned to them or for which they had acted as a 2AC. As a result, many more submissions were discussed than were finally accepted. In total, the PC and 1,021 external reviewers spent countless hours providing feedback to the authors. After this rigorous process, a total of 58 submissions - 45 full papers and 13 notes -- were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 22%. A subcommittee discussed and selected 21 of the 58 accepted submissions to be considered for special recognition in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. SIGCHI rules require that only 5% of submissions be nominated for best paper, with only 1% eventually getting the award. The aforementioned list of 21 accepted submissions was therefore reduced to 10 papers and 4 notes for consideration. Of these, 2 papers and 1 note were recognized as Best of CSCW 2011, while the remaining were awarded an honorable mention. These submissions are marked with small icons in the table of contents.},

By testing innovations in diverse settings and coordinating what is learned from the tests, a NIC builds an infrastructure for addressing educational problems. To gain a deeper understanding of coordination and collaboration in a NIC, I take a case-based approach to build a theory of coordinated collaborative action in a NIC. Drawing upon qualitative and social network data from an operating NIC, I seek to understand the nature of the NIC's coordinated collaborative action and uncover mechanisms that facilitate consequential joint work.},

Individuals were formed into groups and used a mobile health application, VERA, to perform 'health behaviors' (such as indicating what they were eating or their exercise behaviors) for other group members via mobile posts. Initial results indicate that these performances tended to be more normatively descriptive than judgmental. In addition, in both cases comparisons between judgmental and descriptive performances showed more negative emotion with judgmental performances. Further analysis will involve determining normative performance patterns over time in the groups, as well as whether the performer's self report of emotion was similar to or different from the performed normative emotion. These findings will better our understanding of how norms are developed and used in group contexts, which could lead to more effective normative health interventions.},

We perform a quantitative analysis of project success of over 5,000 open source software projects hosted on GitHub, a website that provides extensive social media functionality. Adapted from the open source literature, we develop two measures of project success, Developer Attention and Work Contribution. We find that projects with highly socially connected developers are not necessarily the most active or popular projects. Oddly, projects with a high level of developer multitasking, i.e., splitting effort equally across multiple projects, tend to receive less Developer Attention, but greater Work Contribution. Success on both measures is strongly positively associated with greater concentration of work among a small number of developers.

It is essential, however, that changes to curriculum be data driven and evidence-based. We employed behavioral observation with shadowing and structured interviews to gather the data reported here. Audiotapes were transcribed and content analyzed. Results reveal three primary areas of iPad use: patient focused, professional focused, and education focused. Within each area residents commented on the iPad's current use, limitations, and future (potential) uses. Chi-square tests revealed significant differences within areas and across usage type. The present findings are the first from a multiyear study examining factors related to enhancing medical education and training.},

While social media benefits have been examined in the literature, relatively little attention has been paid to the relationship of privacy to these benefits. Privacy has traditionally been framed as a way for individuals to protect themselves from the consequences of too much information disclosure. However, privacy can be a means to enhance social media outcomes and is essential for coordinating cooperative relationships. In this workshop we seek to: a) broaden the lens of social media privacy research to examine the benefits and outcomes of interactional privacy as they relate to social media goals; and b) discuss the design of social media interfaces that are responsive to both relational and privacy needs.},
