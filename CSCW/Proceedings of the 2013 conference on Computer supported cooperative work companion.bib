 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2013 ACM Computer Supported Cooperative Work -- CSCW'13. This year's conference continues its tradition of being the premier forum for research on online collaboration, social computing, and social media studies. CSCW meets a wide range of research interests, from technical communication systems building to ethnographic studies of computer-mediated collaboration in the wild. The mission of the conference is to share novel research in these domains of interest in order to advance the state of the art in CSCW. CSCW is committed to innovation in all aspects of research. This year's conference marks the second year in which the conference used a revision cycle in the paper reviewing process. The goal of this process is to increase quality of accepted papers and grow the program to better reflect the richness of our field. 390 paper submissions were received, 139 of which were accepted for publication after going through two rigorous review cycles. This year also marks the first year in which page length limits and the Papers/Notes distinction were eliminated, resulting in an overall modest increase in the length of papers. In all, the changes to the authoring and reviewing process have generated more papers of higher quality. CSCW '13 also has tracks for posters, demos, videos, workshops, panels, and a doctoral consortium, all of which are seeing tremendous participation. The workshops alone, for instance, have attracted almost 150 participants. For the first time, CSCW this year will have an open format "unconference" track where attendees can explore ideas in greater depth. We will also have a fitness track to start each day with some collaborative healthy activity. In addition to the stellar technical program, CSCW'13 hosts two exciting keynote speakers, Ron Burt and Jascha Franklin-Hodge. Ron will open the conference with a discussion of his research on volatility and advantage in networks, while Jascha will close the conference with an in-thetrenches look at modern digital democracy. Other highlights outside the papers program include a posters and videos reception and the main conference reception, both of which should provide time to connect with your fellow CSCW researchers.},
