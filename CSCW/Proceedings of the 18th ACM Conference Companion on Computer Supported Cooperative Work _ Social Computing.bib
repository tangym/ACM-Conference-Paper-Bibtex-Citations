Gamifying the underlying incentive mechanism can be a solution to elicit and sustain the desired user behavior. In this paper, we develop a theory of gamification and study the impact of a hierarchical badges system, a reward mechanism based on gamification principles, on user participation and engagement at Stack Overflow Q&A site. Specifically, we assess the extent to which users are incentivized by earned badges in their contributions to the answering activity. Our initial results present strong empirical evidence that confirms the value of the badges and the effectiveness of gamification in stimulating voluntary participation.},

As a way to study and react to this trend, we demo TWITTERTRAILS, an interactive, web-based tool (twittertrails.com) that allows users to investigate the origin and propagation characteristics of a rumor and its refutation, if any, on Twitter. Visualizations of burst activity, propagation timeline, retweet and co-retweeted networks help its users trace the spread of a story. Within minutes TWITTERTRAILS will collect relevant tweets and automatically answer several important questions regarding a rumor: its originator, burst characteristics, propagators and main actors according to the audience. In addition, it will compute and report the rumor's level of visibility and, as an example of the power of crowdsourcing, the audience's skepticism towards it which correlates with the rumor's credibility. We envision TWITTERTRAILS as valuable tool for individual use, and especially for amateur and professional journalists investigating recent and breaking stories.},

It is critical to acknowledge this history and collectively understand how the CSCW community can learn from CSCW in LA and how LA researchers can be better represented in and integrated into international CSCW. The goal of this workshop is twofold. First, to provide a forum for researchers working in LA to present their work for the international CSCW community, and second, to allow the international CSCW community to understand the issues around doing CSCW research in LA. Senior discussants will be invited to discuss the work of LA researchers and introduce key issues from their regions, therefore facilitating the cross-region conversations among participants.},

The relative positions are then used for identifying the recipient of transferred data by performing a swipe on the screen of the sending device towards the physical direction of the recipient. Shuriken is built upon the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) framework and only uses built-in sensors of typical smart devices. Users link their devices by pointing them towards each other to form a group and to create a BLE connection. The received radio signal strength and the digital compass readings are obtained and then distributed to estimate the relative positions of the devices. Additional devices can be included in an existing group by performing the same action with any device in the group. Devices in the group can perform data transfer and the data is passed through linked devices in a multi-hop approach. We envision practical uses of Shuriken in collaborative shopping in a café, data transfer in business meetings and localisation of multiple smart devices that are in close proximity. To the best of our knowledge, Shuriken is the first approach that performs user grouping and data transfer based on the inter-device relative positions calculated from sensor readings available in off-the-shelf smart devices.},

 abstract = {Affinity diagrams are a popular method for creating and organizing ideas. While there are many digital solutions for collaborative affinity diagram, they have not been widely adopted due to usability challenges, so may teams still revert back to traditional method of sticky notes for their affinity diagramming activities. We proposed Distributed Affinity Diagram System (DADS) to solve the existing usability problems and present a more usable solution compared with the traditional method. DADS proposes a dual-screen terminal that divides private input screen from common interactive screen in each user's setup. While private input encourages users to create and nurture ideas, common interactive spaces are designed to sync all users' actions across all terminals, allowing users to collaborate interactively through a distributed multi-touch system. The separation of input space and the distributed synchronized interactive space can improve usability, efficiency, and user satisfaction.},

In spite of the increasing research effort in recent years, the beneficial effects of CQA systems have not been fully discovered in organizational and educational environments yet. We present a novel concept of an organization-wide educational CQA system that fills the gap between open and too restricted class communities of learners. In order to evaluate its feasibility, we designed CQA system Askalot. Askalot was experimentally evaluated during a summer term at our university with more than 600 users. The results of the experiment provide an insight into employment of CQA systems as nontraditional learning environments that utilize a diversity of students' knowledge in a whole organization.},

This experimental study examines, whether computer-supported awareness about the preferences of all team members (i.e. Preference Awareness) can foster accurate joint priorities within a team. 150 participants were randomly assigned to teams of three members with different preferences in either a condition with or without Preference Awareness. The team members had to prepare jointly for an upcoming negotiation via audio conference and afterwards were asked for their priorities for the negotiation. The stated priorities in the condition with preference awareness covered the preferences of all team members significantly better than in the condition without awareness.},

However, small mobile displays and network unreliability make the critical element of visual identification between users difficult, particularly within a possibly crowded environment. A human-in-the-loop handshaking protocol can bypass technical limitations but may introduce complexities arising from human errors and inconsistencies. This paper describes a demonstration that showcases the unique capabilities and challenges of cooperative photography. The demonstration will allow users to provide valuable data for creating more effective and efficient systems for collaborating users in mobile CSCW activities.},

In this study we investigate ways to motivate local crowds to serve as the world's sensors and provide geographical data about their surroundings. We conduct interviews and a pilot study to understand whether we can motivate people to contribute data about their neighborhoods via games or for the greater social good of helping the neighborhood. Our results provide a glimpse of how people feel about donating neighborhood data given different motivators; they also provide insight into the amount of data people are willing to contribute. We conclude by discussing possible design implications of our findings.},

Using the lenses of gender, recovery, and performance, our proposed panel explores the tensions that emerge when the richness and complexity of individual personalities and subjectivities run up against design norms that imagine identity as simplistic or one-dimensional. These models of identity not only limit the ways individuals can express their own identities, but also establish norms for other users about what to expect, causing further issues when the inevitable dislocations do occur. We discuss the challenges in translating identity into these systems, and how this is further marred by technical requirements and normative logics that structure cultures and practices of databases, algorithms and computer programming.},

It is scalable in that it allows a single helper to resolve the difficulties of a large number of people in difficulty.

Besides the well-recognized room features like price, minimum stay, and amenities, our result shows that social features such as responsiveness of host, count of Wish List, number of reviews, and membership seniority are significantly associated with room sales. On the other hand, some of the conventional social features such as overall rating and number of references turned out to be not so critical for room sales.},

In keeping with previous years, CSCW 2014 presents premier research on computer-mediated collaboration, social computing, and social media, from the design of technical systems for collaboration to ethnographic studies of use in the wild. The mission of the conference is to share the novel research that will advance the state of our art. The conference program embraces a variety of perspectives, reflecting how collaboration permeates different aspects of people's work, social, and civic lives. This diversity of perspectives is mirrored by geographic diversity among contributors. The CSCW 2014 program retains the richly articulated structure of previous conferences in this series including a robust program of workshops, papers, panels, demonstrations, videos, and interactive posters. This year, we also introduce CSCWhat's Next, a selection of forward-looking research-in-progress papers intended to foster discussion. Another innovation this year is the option for demos, videos and poster presenters to give short talks about their work immediately preceding Monday night's reception. Special highlights this year include our opening plenary talk, "Making a Difference In and Through Playful Design," by Mary Flanagan of Dartmouth University and our closing plenary, "Next Generation Humanitarian Computing," by Patrick Meier of Qatar Computing Research Institute. We will also present the inaugural CSCW Lasting Impact Award to Jonathan Grudin for his groundbreaking 1988 paper "Why CSCW applications fail: Problems in the design and evaluation of organizational interfaces." Interest in CSCW'14 is as high as ever, including a record number of paper submissions.

We describe a method -- based on Gutwin and Greenberg's mechanics of collaboration (MoC) framework -- for evaluating prototype groupware systems that have not yet been deployed with the minimum number of users needed to be truly functional. We believe this is a valuable method for evaluating early prototype groupware.},

Although they have many possible uses, casual and sexual encounters remain an important part of their draw. For CSCW, these apps are interesting to study: they offer a context to explore issues of identity and self-presentation, geography and locality, privacy and security, as well as motivation and usage habits. In this one-day workshop, we invite researchers, students, and practitioners from a diverse range of backgrounds, including CSCW, computer science, sociology, and public health, to discuss these issues and more, as well as to explore the difficulties and challenges inherent in this research. In addition to exploring the issues around apps for sex and dating, participants will also help to bring some of these sensitive, yet important topics into the mainstream of CSCW research.},

Over the last four years the CSCW conference community has been conducting the review process in two rounds. In the first round reviewers are encouraged to review papers with an eye to improving the intellectual strength and contributions of the paper, making it clear which changes would be helpful and which are likely required to make the paper acceptable. In the second round, the same reviewers see the same paper and review to understand whether or not the revised paper now meets the standards of the CSCW community as acceptable. This two-round review model, with encouraging and intellectual give-andtake, is designed to improve papers of good quality but in need of work that might otherwise slip just below the bar in the more common one-shot reviewing conferences. As the Papers Co-Chairs we received numerous email commenting on the high quality of the reviewing, even from some authors whose work was not accepted. Of all the submissions, 262 were offered the opportunity to R&R, representing a little over 45% of the original submissions. A very small number of authors either withdrew their papers or otherwise declined to resubmit their papers. The Program Committee accepted 161 papers for an acceptance rate of 28% of the total.},

It is used not only for cooking, but also to heat houses, and to provide lighting. Most Mexican villagers use wood via stoves, however these appliances usually bring health hazards and are harmful for the environment. Due to these problems new technologies, such as efficient stoves, have been implemented to bring better combustion, reduce amount of smoke, and overall make the transfer of heat more efficient. However, the social adoption of efficient stoves is non-trivial. Our study shows how making efficient stoves follow the guidelines of appropriate technology, we can: 1) successfully understand the cultural and social aspects of how villagers use renewable energy; 2) design technology that by considering a region's traditions, is used long term.},

 abstract = {Co-located environments have long been considered ideal for many types of group work, such as planning, decision-making, and design, since they provide a rich communication environment (e.g. delay-free voice communication, face-to-face interaction, eye gaze, and non-verbal communication), as well as promote awareness and coordination through the use of shared artifacts. However, the recent move towards multi-device ecologies in co-located settings, such as the use of multiple personal devices (e.g., laptops, tablets) or multiple personal devices in conjunction with larger, shared displays, such as digital walls or tabletops, can interfere with these common co-located communication and collaboration strategies, as various group members mentally and/or physical shift their focus to their personal devices rather than to their collaborators or to any physically shared artifacts. Group communications and coordination can easily breakdown in these scenarios as the lack of a physically shared group focus of attention can limit awareness of other's activities and task progress. In this workshop, researchers and practitioners will explore design techniques that can be used to address this issue, and improve group awareness in these co-located multi-device ecologies. This will be accomplished through group presentations, brainstorming sessions, and small-group breakout sessions.},

The play environment attempts to mimic the real world ball-passing exercise (or rehabilitation sessions) except that the players can be miles away from each other, and they interact without a physical ball. Moreover, our system allows each player to see the other two and their physical environment respectively, which is a combination of the physical world where players are situated and the virtual world where they play with each other. Kinect sensors are used to map players' action into a virtual world including the passing of the virtual ball.},

 abstract = {Socializing new users into a community that has a complicated set of norms and practices often presents a large challenge for peer production projects such as Wikipedia. Failure to do so successfully leads to confusion and alienation amongst newcomers. The authors present The Wikipedia Adventure, an interactive game that orients new users on Wikipedia in the basics of editing. We estimate the effect that inviting new users to play this game has on their subsequent contribution levels in Wikipedia, and find that overall, users invited to play The Wikipedia Adventure contributed more edits to talk pages.},

@proceedings{Cosley:2015:2675133,
 abstract = {The CSCW community continues to grow. This year we received 575 papers which represents a 13% increase over the total submissions for the prior year. We had submissions from 24 countries covering all continents. This year was the fourth year of the "Revise and Resubmit" (R&R) process. Over the last four years the CSCW conference community has been conducting the review process in two rounds. In the first round reviewers are encouraged to review papers with an eye to improving the intellectual strength and contributions of the paper, making it clear which changes would be helpful and which are likely required to make the paper acceptable. In the second round, the same reviewers see the same paper and review to understand whether or not the revised paper now meets the standards of the CSCW community as acceptable. This two-round review model, with encouraging and intellectual give-andtake, is designed to improve papers of good quality but in need of work that might otherwise slip just below the bar in the more common one-shot reviewing conferences. As the Papers Co-Chairs we received numerous email commenting on the high quality of the reviewing, even from some authors whose work was not accepted. Of all the submissions, 262 were offered the opportunity to R&R, representing a little over 45% of the original submissions. A very small number of authors either withdrew their papers or otherwise declined to resubmit their papers. The Program Committee accepted 161 papers for an acceptance rate of 28% of the total.},

We begin to fill this gap by performing an in depth case study of a global scientific data hub -- the Encyclopedia of Life -- in which we analyzed the organizational-level identities of 259 data providers and developing a typology of the identities, including: Venerable organizations, Repositories, Citizen science initiatives, Social media platforms, Education communities, and Subsidiaries. This study will provide data aggregation and integration technology designers with background information on data collections.},

 abstract = {Affordable mobile handsets and easier access to mobile internet has popularized the usage of existing social networking systems (SNSes) in the developing world. Most of these (E.g. Facebook, Twitter etc.) are text-heavy and do not work well for low-literate populations in resource constrained settings. We designed and deployed KrishiPustak, an audio-visual SN mobile application for low-literate farming populations in rural India. KrishiPustak has a text-free design, with all functionality represented by graphical icons. To support poor internet connectivity it also works in an offline mode. In this demo paper we discuss the motivations behind KrishiPustak, the design decisions we took and the development of the actual application. This demo is an abbreviated companion for a separate CSCW paper published in this conference[4].},
