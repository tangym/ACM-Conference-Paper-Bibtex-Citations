 abstract = {This year the CSCW conference received 571 submitted papers from 1507 unique authors located in 45 different countries covering six continents. CSCW uses a two-phase review process designed to help authors improve promising papers by revising them in response to reviews. Papers are initially reviewed by three or more expert reviewers, including both members of our program committee and outside reviewers selected for each paper. Those that are judged as having high potential are asked to revise their papers and resubmit them for a second round of review. At least two program committee members review each revised submission (along with the external reviewers in all cases requesting major revisions) to make a final recommendation to the entire program committee. This year, we had a program committee of 81 expert CSCW researchers from all over the world, who managed the process of recruiting reviewers, writing reviews and meta-reviews, and making decisions about papers. We are particularly excited that we this year managed to have the program committee meeting in Europe for the first time. We met in August in Copenhagen, Denmark organized in collaboration with Computer Science Department (DIKU) at University of Copenhagen and the IT University of Copenhagen (ITU). Of the 571 papers submitted, 242 papers (43%) were invited to revise and undergo a second round of review. 228 revised papers were actually submitted, and we accepted 142 papers. This means that the acceptance rate for CSCW 2016 is 25% overall (and 62% of those which were re-submitted).},

 abstract = {New technologies continuously challenge people's information privacy, while privacy protection practices, such as Privacy-by-Design, did not become widespread engineering practices. The difficulty of designing privacy-preserving information systems highlights the need for studying developers' privacy decision-making processes, as the developers' communities are well coordinated and they are the ones who can promote or hinder privacy in the systems they design. We conducted an online survey (n=101), to understand the effectors on developers' professional privacy attitudes and practices. We investigate whether developer's privacy decision-making is shaped by several factors, including organizational (organizational privacy climate, business and legal contexts), professional (privacy knowledge) and personal (personal perceived privacy).},

Nevertheless, we argued that the existing measurement of OCBs does not cover unique aspects generating in the virtual context and thus the OCBs of virtual members indeed broadly exist. Through conducting an inductive research of 123 virtual employees and 428 office employees of one high-technology company, we eventually identified a few unique virtual-featured OCBs and compared the OCBs in globally distributed teams and on-site teams respectively. Surprisingly, we also found the behaviors of virtual members generally have larger impacts on the team, than on-site colleagues do. The ongoing research is currently developing a scale of OCBs in virtual context, which would serve for future explorations.},

In this workshop, we take an intentional pause to unpack the potential ethical questions and concerns this agenda might raise. Rather than strictly focusing on privacy as a state that is always desired--where more privacy is viewed unequivocally as "better"--we consider situations where privacy may not be optimal for researchers, end users, or society. We discuss the current research landscape, including the recent updates to the ACM's Code of Ethics, and how researchers and designers can make more informed decisions regarding ethics, privacy, and other competing values in privacy-related research and designs.

Specifically, we show that learners desire connecting affinity space learning to place by using finely-detailed, context-sensitive connections so that they can reflect place back to their affinity space visibly and possibly tangibly. Interestingly, social interactions serve to strengthen the bonds between people and interest in the physical places and learners do not require an extensive technological social feature.},

Recent improvements in speech recognition and computing power has led to conversational interfaces being introduced to many of the devices we use every day, such as smartphones, watches, and even televisions. These interfaces allow us to get things done, often by just speaking commands, relying on a reasonably well understood single-user model. While research on speech recognition is well established, the social implications of these interfaces remain underexplored, such as how we socialise, work, and play around such technologies, and how these might be better designed to support collaborative collocated talk-in-action. Moreover, the advent of new products such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home, which are positioned as supporting multi-user interaction in collocated environments such as the home, makes exploring the social and collaborative challenges around these products, a timely topic. In the workshop, we will review current practices and reflect upon prior work on studying talk-in-action and collocated interaction.

 abstract = {Recently, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have provided support to human decision-making, and there has been some controversy regarding whether AI can be used to support judges in court. This study investigates the influence of data that is presented by a robotic system on human judgment in a sentence estimation situation in court. The study includes an experiment in which participants played the role of a juror in a sentence estimation task. Participants were presented with scripts of the case, reference materials regarding similar cases, and sentences given by the expert robotic system and human, and then, determined an adequate sentence based on this information. Results show that participants interacting with the robotic system tend to agree with the presented material (in the same way as with human experts) when it is adequate. This result shows that robotic systems are treated the same way as humans, and that intelligent systems can be a reliable source of information for human decision-making in court. Moreover, the results show that robotic systems may, in some cases, be considered more trustworthy than humans.},

 abstract = {E-petitioning is a prominent form of Internet-based collective action. We apply theories from organizational population ecology to investigate whether similar petitions compete for signatures. We use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify topical niches. Using these niches, we test two theories from population ecology on 442,109 Change.org petitions. First, we find evidence for density dependence, an inverse-U-shaped relationship between the density of a petition's niche and the number of signatures the petition obtains. This suggests e-petitioning is competitive and that e-petitions draw on overlapping resource pools. Second, although resource partitioning theory predicts that topically specialized petitions will obtain more signatures in concentrated populations, we find no evidence of this. This suggests that specialists struggle to avoid competition with generalists.},

Finally, remixing provides the opportunity to practice the real-world skill of elaborating upon the work of others.

In current marketplaces, workers and requesters are often unable to trust each other's quality, and their mental models of tasks are misaligned due to ambiguous instructions or confusing edge cases. This breakdown of trust typically arises from (1) flawed reputation systems which do not accurately reflect worker and requester quality, and from (2) poorly designed tasks. In this demo, we present how Boomerang and Prototype Tasks, the fundamental building blocks of the Daemo crowdsourcing marketplace, help restore trust between workers and requesters. Daemo's Boomerang reputation system incentivizes alignment between opinion and ratings by determining the likelihood that workers and requesters will work together in the future based on how they rate each other. Daemo's Prototype tasks require that new tasks go through a feedback iteration phase with a small number of workers so that requesters can revise their instructions and task designs before launch.},

We propose a new model where workers earn ownership of trained AI systems, allowing them to draw a long-term royalty from a tool that replaces their labor. This concept offers benefits for workers and requesters alike, reducing the upfront costs of model training while increasing longer-term rewards to workers. We identify design and technical problems associated with this new concept, including finding market opportunities for trained models, financing model training, and compensating workers fairly for training contributions. A survey of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk about this idea finds that workers are willing to give up 25% of their earnings in exchange for an investment in the future performance of a machine learning system.},

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference. CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors. As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels. Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI & Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

 abstract = {Building communities for online learners may ameliorate pervasive issues relating to learner retention and satisfaction. To move in this direction, we propose that educational technology infrastructures should make personal information about students more visible, so as to invite and encourage social interaction. We are exploring this "visibility proposition" through a design research project. In this paper we report part of our quantitative empirical work carried out to support the collection and visualization of student information (what we call online personae). This work points to an information framework for online personae for distance learners. We also discuss the design implications for helping distance learners to uncover meaningful but hidden connections within virtual learning communities.},

However, the annotation tools extant do not usually support sensemaking of those annotations. Using existing research as a foundation, we define a conceptual model for collaborative sensemaking that is based on human-machine collaboration.

With an aim to building a new community of practice, the workshop will provide an open forum for scholars and practitioners to probing the merits and limitations of social theory for CSCW research. We welcome participants with diverse theoretical interests, ranging from organizational theory to intersectionality, social materiality to pragmatism, practice theory, and beyond.},

This study examines how automated attribution can alleviate attribution apprehension and thus facilitate creative integration in open communities. Attribution apprehension, i.e., a user's anxiety over proper attribution of reused artifacts, adversely impacts the tendencies to engage in the integration process. Because open communities thrive on the basis of fairness, automated attribution features are essential in fostering creative integration. This study draws upon task-technology fit to craft a theoretical framework for explaining this phenomenon, reviews current tools for automated attribution in different communities and describes findings of a pilot survey on how those tools can encourage creative integration.},

Many of these events are not strictly pharmacological, but rather are related to practical challenges in the coordination of care,prescribing, dispensing, and medication use, and may be preventable with new modes of documentation and communication for medication management. Action ADE is a CSCW intervention that aims to enable communication of patient ADE information across healthcare settings in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Implementing Action ADE requires negotiations of political agendas and policy change, evolving medical information system infrastructures, and the needs and practices of clinicians and patients. As the initial design phase for Action ADE comes to a close and we enter into our first phase of piloting and implementation, this poster provides a snapshot of five domains in which our project intervenes and highlights findings from our extensive qualitative work.},

Considerable time will be devoted to discussing work in post-colonial feminism, queer theory, Women of Color feminism, and feminist critical disability studies. Through generative conversation with participants, feedback on works-in-progress, and the initiation of outlets for new feminist CSCW work, we aim to 1) build on existing research and practice and 2) identify concerns and approaches for both designing and assessing research oriented toward intersectional and feminist futures in the context of CSCW and social computing.},

Here, resources are typically pooled via common e-infrastructures for data access and processing, a set-up requiring additional layers of coordination. Such a focus largely foregrounds the sciences and other fields that rely on highly structured (or structure-able) data and the routinized processes of analysis. In contrast, in this one-day workshop we discuss the conditions and challenges characteristic of research collaboration in the qualitative social sciences and humanities (SSH). In particular, we examine the sociotechnical infrastructures that enable and support research practices that--in comparison with the collaborative paradigm of the natural sciences--tend to be less structured, compartmentalized, and routinized, but more fluid, flexible, and open-ended. The workshop seeks to collect empirical insights and design experiences, preparing the grounds for a comprehensive understanding of the role of e-infrastructures for collaborative research practices in SSH.},

Because patients' priorities often reflect their values-things important and meaningful in their lives-it is important to incorporate values into patient-provider conversations. However, patients often withhold values from providers when they do not perceive them to be pertinent. In a field study with 24 patients with multiple chronic conditions, we sought to understand how participants perceived relationships among their values and their health concerns. We found that participants felt overwhelmed by multiple concerns, but were able to surmount these feelings when they pursued values that were linked to self-care. We discuss implications for patient-provider communication to help patients link values with self-care practices.},

Moreover, note taking can be seen as distracting to all of the participants involved and disrupt the flow of conversation. Nonetheless, note taking is a significant method for people to augment their own memory by selectively categorizing information as valuable and storing it through text or audio for future reference.

We propose that interactive playgrounds are vehicles for playful cooperation when robots are integrated into the system as cooperative co-players. We developed the Hatch 'em all game, wherein children are encouraged to hatch eggs cooperatively with a robot, and tested the effect of the robot's cooperative behavior on the children. We found that when the robot played cooperatively, children cooperated and helped the robot more than when the robot played selfishly. Our findings suggest that the social affordances of the playground, together with the social interactions between the children and the robot, enabled instances of team cooperation and prosocial behavior. Our work contributes to the CSCW community by opening a novel avenue for supporting children's cooperation, which could serve as a future testbed to investigate the role of robots in cooperative interaction},

The goal for the workshop is therefore to advance research in computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human robot interaction (HRI) by raising awareness for the social and technical challenges that surround the placement of robots within work-groups and teams. The workshop will be organized around three central questions: (1) How do robots shape the dynamics of groups and teams in existing settings? (2) How does a robot's behavior shape how humans interact with each other in dyads and in larger groups and teams? (3) How can robots improve the performance of work groups and teams by acting on social processes? These core issues will be covered across a set of presentations that initiate in- depth discussions around each question to improve the quality of and support the growth of research in the CSCW community that focuses on the intersection of robots, groups, and teams.},

Preliminary analysis of 609 qualitative responses reveals that people perceive concomitantly negative, positive and/or neutral impacts of not having Internet access and often are able to articulate various offline methods they will use to cope should such an event occur. However most concerns of impact are about quality of career/work, knowledge/awareness of the world, and quality of social ties and less about basics such as food, water and electricity. These findings provide implications for educators, emergency management professionals, and designers as they plan for such alternatives.},

Today, nothing could be further from the truth. Users are increasingly more connected and are creating more and more content online, on mobile devices, and in cloud based applications. Users are increasingly expecting collaborative editing functionalities in all of their applications. The focus of this year's workshop is: 1) to explore recent advances in the technologies that enable collaborative editing systems, 2) to evaluate the adoption of these technologies by commercial industry and the open source communities, and 3) to foster an exchange of ideas between CE researchers and end-user CE systems builders. The goal is to increase the adoption of recent technological advancements in CE research by practitioners and to have practitioners identify real-world challenges for future research.},

 abstract = {Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference. CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors. As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels. Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI & Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

 abstract = {Within the context of a program focused on learning concepts and practices for keeping watersheds healthy and then completing community-based projects, we explore ways that NatureNet, a prototype mobile and web-based technology, can support volunteer watershed stewards. Using a mixed methods approach, our analysis of the experiences of 50 volunteers over a 16-month study period revealed that two of their strongest needs are: (1) place-based information about the location in which they are stewards, and (2) support for navigating resource challenges, including information about watersheds, tools (both digital and physical), introductions to others, and financial support in order to complete their projects. Using a combination of theory and iterative design thinking, we describe design strategies to address these needs. This study informs research beyond our specific context by providing an approach to technology design that supports development of community-driven nature projects.},

Providing healthcare staff with training, however, is difficult because of several organizational and social challenges. E-learning can potentially provide the means to tackle these challenges, but the benefits of e-learning have not yet been fully capitalized. In this paper, we describe our requirements analysis and a paper-based evaluation of a future training process. The main elements of the training include computer-supported communication and coordination, more hands-on training, and shorter trainee-trainer meetings. The next step will be the implementation of a prototype and the evaluation of variables, such as time spent on the training process and clinical skill gain, and also the effects of the organizational and social changes caused by the new training process.},

InCircle was introduced in a language and culture class at university in Japan in order to boost up out-of-class interaction among students and to enhance learning opportunities out-of-class. The result of the pilot evaluation showed that the number of the students' posting dramatically increased, while its out-of-class use was not active as expected.},

 abstract = {Recently, electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) communication has been included in various online recommender systems. However, the type of information that effectively recommends a product is not clearly understood. To allow consumers to select an optimal product, it is necessary to understand the human purchasing model and discover an interface design that can effectively present information. It has been predicted that pages that include negative eWOM facilitate trust toward the system, although cognitive resources are required to process the information. The results of a controlled experiment show that participants who encountered negative eWOM and have less cognitive load could developed higher trust toward the product and were motivated to purchase it. This study implies that cognitive factors such as access to negative eWOM are important for developing trust and motivating product buying behavior. It contributes to determining when negative eWOM can be effective and provides new knowledge about developing consumer buying models on the web.},

In recent years, a number of initiatives across the world have applied crowdsourcing to contexts including constitutional reform, drafting federal bills, and generating local policies. However, crowd-civic systems also come with challenges and risks such as socio-technical barriers, marginalization of specific groups, silencing of interests, etc. Using a design-thinking approach, this workshop will address both opportunities and challenges of crowd-civic systems to develop best practices for increasing public engagement with law and policy. The workshop organizers will suggest an initial framework explicitly intended to be criticized by participants and reconfigured through a series of iterative cooperative small-group activities focusing on ``diagnosing'' the failures of past crowd-civic system efforts and the successes of online action around social issues. While the ultimate objective of the workshop is to develop a best practices guide, we see iterations on the guide as a mechanism for fostering community and collaboration among policymakers, technologists, and researchers around crowd-civic systems for law and policy.},
