 abstract = {We present three studies that compare adoption and appropriation between China and the United States of BlogCentral, an internal blogging tool employed by a large global enterprise. We first analyzed 23 months of usage logs for users in both countries and found that compared to the U.S., Chinese users were much less active, with less activity and sparser user interaction. We then conducted 25 interviews and surveyed 213 bloggers in both countries to understand user motivations and behaviors of corporate blogging in more detail. The results show that Chinese employees use internal blogs for organizing personal work and short term team formation, unlike U.S. users who are driven more by the goal of sharing information to a broad community. The Chinese users were seeking (and not finding) greater social interaction and felt instead a sense of alienation from the global blogging community. We further identify a gap between Chinese users' requirement for local community and the existing global aspect of enterprise blogging tools. Lastly we discuss implications from the data analysis.},

We investigated whether the aggregated privacy choices of one's social circle might guide users in making informed privacy decisions. We conducted an experiment in which users specified preferences for six privacy-relevant settings in Instant Messaging. In one condition, users were provided with information indicating the privacy preferences of the majority of their ``buddies." Our results suggest that while this information did influence user choices, the effect was secondary to that of the ``privacy-sensitivity" of the system feature controlled by the particular setting. Frequency of IM usage was also associated with privacy choices. The experiment data coupled with user comments suggest several usability improvements in interfaces for specifying privacy preferences.},

@article{Gallardo:2013:MCP:2428826.2428937,
 abstract = {Over the last two decades, Collaborative Systems have become increasingly popular thanks to the many advances made in networks, communications and software tools. Within this field, Collaborative Modeling Systems apply the collaborative paradigm to the construction of (often visual) models, where users build diagrams from building blocks and the relationships between them. In these kinds of applications, the work is usually arranged into sessions, with the definition of some kind of time organization between those sessions. This organization is known as a collaboration protocol. Unfortunately, it is not usually easy to define these protocols, and many applications do not allow users to make any use of them. In an effort to overcome these difficulties, in this paper we propose a visual language for defining collaboration protocols for these systems. As such, in our language, sessions, artifacts and the transformations between them can be specified visually, and different coordination relationships (such as fork and join) can be defined. The visual language is included in a development method for collaborative systems that take advantage of the Eclipse platform in order to develop model-driven graphical editors that are enhanced with collaboration capabilities.},

While there are several potential technical solutions to this difficulty, we know little about social solutions, such as one user telling a peer about a tool. To explore these social solutions in one particular domain, we describe a series of interviews with 18 programmers in industry that explore how tool discovery takes place. These interviews provide a rich set of qualitative data that give us detailed insights into how programmers discover tools. One finding was that, while programmers believe that discovery from peers is effective, they actually discover tools from peers relatively infrequently. Another finding was that programmers can effectively discover tools from their peers both in a co-located and remote settings. We describe several implications of our findings, such as that discovery from peers can be enhanced by improving programmers' ability to communicate openly and concisely about tools.},

We interviewed 65 Iraqi citizens who experienced the current Gulf War beginning in March 2003. In the context of a disrupted environment, trust in people and institutions can erode. We find that trust is contextual-as aspects of the physical world change, conceptions of trust can also change. We show how people were able to create a context of trust in the environment by using ICTs to manage their public identity, to conduct background checks, and to develop collaborative practices that relied on those with whom interpersonal trust previously existed. These new practices, in turn, enabled people to maintain work collaborations, to determine whether or not to continue interacting with others in public, to be able to travel safely, and to find trustworthy jobs. In developing these new practices we argue that technology enabled people to restore a sense of normalcy in an environment that had radically changed.},

The output of this will enhance communication by enabling a remote actor to be realistically projected into another person's local space, projected into an extension of the local space, or projected into a shared virtual space.

 abstract = {Welcome to the 2010 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work! We hope that this conference will be a place to hear exciting talks about the latest in CSCW research, an opportunity to learn new things, and a chance to connect with friends in the community. We are pleased to see such a strong and diverse program at this year's conference. We have a mix of research areas represented -- some that are traditionally part of our community, and several that have not been frequently seen at CSCW. There are sessions to suit every taste: from collaborative software development, healthcare, and groupware technologies, to studies of Wikipedia, family communications, games, and volunteering. We are particularly interested in a new kind of forum at the conference this year -- the 'CSCW Horizon' -- which will present novel and challenging ideas, and will do so in a more interactive fashion than standard paper sessions. The program is an exciting and topical mix of cutting-edge research and thought in CSCW. A major change for CSCW beginning this year is our move from being a biennial to an annual conference. This has meant a change in the time of the conference (from November to February), and subsequent changes in all of our normal deadlines and procedures. Despite these changes, the community has responded with enormous enthusiasm, and we look forward to the future of yearly meetings under the ACM CSCW banner.},

If potential troubles with search queries emerge, either the user or the search engine may initiate repair on the query in ways that resemble repair in human conversation as described in conversation analysis. Users can repair their own queries in first or third position, while search engines can initiate repair from second position. However search-engine interactions currently contain no fourth-position repair. Finally search engines may also complete queries collaboratively with users in ways that are similar to but distinct from repair. In this study we examine interactions between users and search engines using a novel approach we call "computer interaction analysis," which utilizes eye-tracking screen video and a novel notation scheme for transcribing it.},

This paper develops a heuristic of collaborative rhythms and points to the work of temporal alignment as a neglected but crucial element underpinning distributed collective practice in the sciences (and other spheres of collective activity). Specifically, we argue that joint scientific work is organized around four separate registers, or 'rhythms' - organizational, infrastructural, biographical, and phenomenal - and that efforts to align such rhythms constitute an important and under-recognized aspect of collaborative work. The ideas and examples are drawn from our own field studies around IT infrastructure and collaborative practice across a range of scientific fields.},

Yet we do not have a clear picture of how software development for science fits into the day-to-day practice of science, or how well the methods and incentives of its production facilitate realization of this potential. We report the results of a multiple-case study of software development in three fields: high energy physics, structural biology, and microbiology. In each case, we identify a typical publication, and use qualitative methods to explore the production of the software used in the science represented by the publication. We identify several different production systems, characterized primarily by differences in incentive structures. We identify ways in which incentives are matched and mismatched with the needs of the science fields, especially with respect to collaboration.},

The bug-fixing process inher-ently has strong inter-personal dynamics at play, especially in how to find the optimal person to handle a bug report. Bug report reassignments, which are a common part of the bug-fixing process, have rarely been studied. In this paper, we present a large-scale quantitative and qualitative analysis of the bug reassignment process in the Microsoft Windows Vista operating system project. We quantify social interactions in terms of both useful and harmful reassignments. For instance, we found that reassignments are useful to determine the best person to fix a bug, contrary to the popular opinion that reassignments are always harmful. We categorized five primary reasons for reassignments: finding the root cause, determining ownership, poor bug report quality, hard to determine proper fix, and workload balancing. We then use these findings to make recommendations for the design of more socially-aware bug tracking systems that can overcome some of the inefficiencies we observed in our study.},

Using a Web browser, people can participate in cooperative work anytime, anywhere from any computing device as long as there is an Internet connection. Lying in the heart of some well-known services is an optimistic consistency control technique called operational transformation (OT). This paper proposes TIPS, a novel sync protocol that adapts OT for Web 2.0 applications. Based on a recent theoretical framework called ABT, it ensures not only convergence but also the right object order for linear documents. Designed to address the HTTP style of communication, TIPS allows clients to sync with the server by independent time intervals and dynamically join and leave at any time. When processing do operations, its time complexity is linear in the total number of operations generated by all clients during one server interval and independent of the size of history. TIPS is efficient for supporting a spectrum of (near-)realtime to asynchronous collaboration editing tasks.},

We use this in situ experiment with a paper prototype to investigate the role-driven nature of coordination and to identify system requirements for computerized support of role-based coordination in time-critical work. While role information is useful in coordinating time-critical work, our findings show that the current low-tech solution did not provide significant improvement in team coordination. The situations that were most in need of role-identification were the least likely to achieve it because role-tags required work by trauma team members. Similarly, because role-tags allowed workarounds and misuse, they proved ineffective in controlling the number of people in the room. We suggest technological ways of identifying roles to help coordination in the trauma bay.},

 abstract = {Social network games (SNGs) are among the most popular games recently. Different from the asynchronous and online based SNGs, we present Surprise Grabber to see how tangible gesture interface could benefit the synchronous co-located social game. In Surprise Grabber, users control a virtual grabber's moving in 3D game to catch the gifts by using their camera phone. An efficient code running on the phone detects hand motion, delivers results to Serve PC and provides feedbacks in real time. Distinguished from online SNGS, all players stand together in front of a public display. The results of the pilot user studies showed that: 1) Gesture interface was easy to catch up and made the game more immersive; 2) Occasionally inaccuracy in hand motion detection made the game more competitive instead of frustrating players; 3) Players' performances were obviously influenced by the social atmosphere; 4) In most cases, players' performances became better or worse at the same time.},

 abstract = {Multi-user chat (MUC) applications raise serious challenges to developers concerning scalability and efficient use of network bandwidth, due to a large number of users exchanging lots of messages in real-time. We propose a new approach to MUC message propagation based on an adaptable consistency model bounded by three metrics: Filter, Time and Volume. In this model, the server propagates some messages as soon as possible while others are postponed until certain conditions are met, according to each client consistency requirements. These requirements can change during the session lifetime, constantly adapting to each client's current context. We developed a prototype called ReConMUC (Relaxed Consistency MUC) as an extension to a well-known MUC protocol, which, by attaching a special component to the server, filters messages before they are broadcast, according to client consistency requirements. The performance results obtained show that ReConMUC effectively reduces the server outbound bandwidth, without significant increase in memory and CPU usage, thus improving scalability.},

 abstract = {Standard web browsers are becoming a common platform for delivering groupware applications, but until recently, the only way to support real-time collaboration was with browser plug-ins. New networking approaches have recently been introduced - based on re-purposed techniques for delivering web pages (Comet), or integration of real-time communication directly into the browser (HTML5 WebSockets). Little is currently known, however, about whether these new approaches can support real-time groupware. We carried out a study to assess the performance of the three different networking approaches, based on a framework of groupware requirements, in several network settings. We found that web-based networking performs well - better than plug-in approaches in some cases - and can support the communication requirements of many types of real-time groupware. We also developed two groupware applications using Comet and WebSockets, and showed that they provided fast and consistent performance on the real-world Internet. Our studies show that web-based networking can support real-time collaboration, and suggest that groupware developers should consider the browser as a legitimate vehicle for real-time multi-user systems.},

 abstract = {Collaborative distributed tabletop activities involving real objects are complicated by invisibility factors introduced into the workspace. In this paper, we propose a technique called "remote lag" to alleviate the problems caused by the invisibility of remote gestures. The technique provides people with instant playback of remote gestures to recover from the missed context of coordination. To examine the effects of the proposed technique, we studied four-person groups who engaged in two mentoring tasks using physical objects with and without remote lags. Our results show that remote lags effectively alleviated the invisibility problems, resulting in fewer questions/confirmations and redundant instructions during collaboration. The technique also decreased the overall workload of workers as well as the temporal demands for both helpers and workers.},

Using a normalized term frequency, we demonstrate how an effective table of contents can be extracted by finding localized "peaky topics". Second, we find "persistent conversations" which have a lower general salience but sustain and persist over the tweet corpus, in effect the whispering conversation that lingers in the background. These methods are demonstrated on a Twitter corpus of 53,000 tweets and a second Twitter corpus of 1.1 million tweets; the methods are generalizable to apply to any normalized scoring metric across a temporal corpus. We propose our method's implications on social media research and systems from a textual and social network analysis perpective.},

To compare these policies, we have a developed a formal analytical model that predicts their performance.

A key CSCW topic is how remotely situated people can collaborate around physical objects which are not mutually shared, without introducing new interactional problems. Our approach, grounded in an ethnographic study of a troubleshooting call centre, was to create a MR system centred on a shared 3D problem representation, rather than to use video or Augmented Reality (AR)-based systems. The key drivers for this choice were that given the devices are sensor equipped and networked, such a representation can create reciprocal viewpoints onto the current state of this particular machine without requiring additional hardware. Testing showed that troubleshooters and customers could mutually orient around the problem representation and found it a useful troubleshooting resource.},

We found family was an extremely important context for sharing online, and that email was still a preferred form of communication for private sharing across facets of life. Single, working men had the highest level of incompatible facets, and a higher level of facet incompatibility was correlated with increased email usage and worry about sharing in the context of social networks.},

@proceedings{Hinds:2011:1958824,
 abstract = {CSCW is now an annual conference and, for the first time ever, it is taking place outside of North America -- this year in China. Despite this change in timing and location, we are pleased to report that the number of submissions for 2011 was in the same range as last year. Moreover, following the United States, China was the second largest contributing nation with 22 submissions. In total, we received 264 papers and notes. These ranged across many different areas, including: designs for new communication and collaboration applications; new interaction techniques for novel hardware like tabletops and public displays; studies of groupware deployment and use, especially in the realm of new social media like micro-blogging and social networking sites; and methods for analyzing social interaction. These submissions addressed a wide range of applications domains, including: healthcare, rural areas, online gaming, mobile computing, preschool, colleges, community workers, and global software development. We think you will be impressed with the final line-up of 58 submissions that made it into CSCW 2011. Full Papers (10 pages) and Notes (4 pages) submissions were reviewed using the same process by the same Program Committee (PC). Much of our work is multidisciplinary and a wide range of expertise is needed in the overseeing program committee to ensure all submissions are fairly reviewed. Therefore, our committee consisted of established and rising researchers as well as practitioners from academia, corporate research laboratories, and consultancies. It included computer scientists, psychologists, designers, engineers, sociologists and linguists. Among them, they had deep knowledge of various domains ranging from game design to science and technology studies, applied to the critical analysis and design of technologies for work and for leisure, used on the move with mobile devices or at a desk on personal computers. We had 40 Associate Chairs (ACs) as the CSCW 2011 PC evaluating the 264 submissions -- 188 full papers and 76 notes. In order to simultaneously front-load some of the PC meeting work and increase the diversity of reviews for each submission, we modified the traditional AC allocation process: each submission was assigned a primary AC (1AC) as well as a secondary AC (2AC) up front. The 1AC and 2AC were allowed to consider desk rejection if there were technical problems with a submission (e.g. formatting) or if it was completely out of scope for the conference. Desk rejection had to be based on agreement between the two ACs and the PC chairs -- otherwise, the submission went into the review process. The 1AC and 2AC worked together to find a minimum of three external reviewers. Following submission of the external reviews, the ACs initiated a discussion among the reviewers, if needed, to resolve conflicting views. The 1ACs and 2ACs then completed a metareview summarizing the reviews and provided detailed comments with a recommendation for acceptance, rejection, and/or a request for additional input from the authors, which the authors were encouraged to provide through a rebuttal procedure. Following this, the reviewers and ACs were asked to consider the authors rebuttal and change their review and/or score if the rebuttal gave reasons to do so. In early November 2010, the PC met for 2 days in Mountain View, California. Submissions without a single positive review were flagged for automatic rejection, leaving 133 submissions to discuss. All had to be presented by their ACs: we did not auto-accept submissions. While the ACs who read the submission made the final recommendation, the decision process was highly visible so that all of the 40 program committee attendees could apply the same standards to their own decisions. ACs were encouraged to discuss at the committee meeting any submission that they thought had merit including those not originally assigned to them or for which they had acted as a 2AC. As a result, many more submissions were discussed than were finally accepted. In total, the PC and 1,021 external reviewers spent countless hours providing feedback to the authors. After this rigorous process, a total of 58 submissions - 45 full papers and 13 notes -- were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 22%. A subcommittee discussed and selected 21 of the 58 accepted submissions to be considered for special recognition in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. SIGCHI rules require that only 5% of submissions be nominated for best paper, with only 1% eventually getting the award. The aforementioned list of 21 accepted submissions was therefore reduced to 10 papers and 4 notes for consideration. Of these, 2 papers and 1 note were recognized as Best of CSCW 2011, while the remaining were awarded an honorable mention. These submissions are marked with small icons in the table of contents.},

 abstract = {Long-distance couples face considerable communication challenges in their relationships. Unlike collocated couples, long-distance couples lack awareness cues associated with physical proximity and must use technologies such as SMS or telephony to stay in sync. We posit that long-distance couples have needs that are not met by prevailing communication technologies, which require explicit action from the sender as well as the receiver. We built CoupleVIBE to explore the properties of an implicit messaging channel and observe how couples would use such a technology. CoupleVIBE is a mobile application that automatically pushes a user's location-information to her partner's mobile phone via vibrotactile cues. We present qualitative results of a four-week user study, studying how seven couples used CoupleVIBE. A key result is that CoupleVIBE's implicit communication modality operated as a foundation that helps keep couples in sync, with other modalities being brought into play when further interaction was needed.},

We explore how expanding a system's understanding of spatially calibrated depth and audio alongside a live video stream can generate semantically rich three-dimensional pixels containing information regarding their material properties and location. We discuss specific scenarios that explore features such as synthetic refocusing, gesture activated privacy, and spatiotemporal graphic augmentation.},

Legacy paper-based systems enable seamless and non-verbal collaboration, but trends in new software and hardware for ATC tend to separate controllers more and more, which hinders collaboration. This paper presents a new interactive system designed to support collaboration in ATC. We ran a series of interviews and workshops to identify collaborative situations in ATC. From this analysis, we derived a set of requirements to support collaboration: support mutual awareness, communication and coordination, dynamic task allocation and simultaneous use with more than two people. We designed a set of new interactive tools to fulfill the requirements, by using a multi-user tabletop surface, appropriate feedthrough, and reified and partially-accomplishable actions. Preliminary evaluation shows that feedthrough is important, users benefit from a number of tools to communicate and coordinate their actions, and the tabletop is actually usable by three people both in tightly coupled tasks and parallel, individual activities. At a higher level, we also found that co-location is not enough to generate mutual awareness if users are not engaged in meaningful collaboration.},

Driven by curiosity, initiative and interdisciplinary exchange, the Urban Informatics Research Lab at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Australia, is an emerging cluster of people interested in research and development at the intersection of people, place and technology with a focus on cities, locative media and mobile technology. This paper seeks to define, for the first time, what we mean by 'urban informatics' and outline its significance as a field of study today. It describes the relevant background and trends in each of the areas of people, place and technology, and highlights the relevance of urban informatics to the concerns and evolving challenges of CSCW. We then position our work in academia juxtaposed with related research concentrations and labels, followed by a discussion of disciplinary influences. The paper concludes with an exposé of the three current research themes of the lab around augmented urban spaces, urban narratives, and environmental sustainability in order to illustrate specific cases and methods, and to draw out distinctions that our affiliation with the Creative Industries Faculty affords.},

Our system has attracted two million registered players since it was launched in late 2008. As the system went beyond a research prototype and reached a large number of real users, we observed performance issues that were mainly caused by unpredicted networking latencies over the public Internet and opportunistic distinction of roles such as active players and passive observers. To address these issues, we propose a novel hybrid consistency control approach that combines the merits of optimistic methods, which help achieve interactivity, and pessimistic methods, which guarantee consistency. As a result, the system can tolerate network round-trip time up to 230 ms, improving the latest work by 43.7%. In addition, the system can support over 1,000 simultaneous observers when a video game is played over the Internet.},

In this paper we describe preliminary results of a small, innovative, student research study, which is yet to be validated with subsequent user studies. Its aim is to identify requirements for the task of brain tumour surgery, toward a wider project considering the development of a tumour removing robot. 5 brain tumour operations are observed using the ethnographic approach of work-practice observation informed by an ethnomethodological orientation. 4 observations are noted and corroborated with examples in evidence. We conclude that this study has identified potential requirements for a surgical robot, which would not have been highlighted using traditional approaches employed in the field of surgical robotics. These requirements may need to be validated with user-studies before being added to a requirements specification for a surgical robot.},

 abstract = {Awareness of other people's activity is an important part of shared-workspace collaboration, and is typically supported using visual awareness displays such as radar views. These visual presentations are limited in that the user must be able to see and attend to the view in order to gather awareness information. Using audio to convey awareness information does not suffer from these limitations, and previous research has shown that audio can provide valuable awareness in distributed settings. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of synthesized dynamic audio information, both on its own and as an adjunct to a visual radar view. We developed a granular-synthesis engine that produces realistic chalk sounds for off-screen activity in a groupware workspace, and tested the audio awareness in two ways. First, we measured people's ability to identify off-screen activities using only sound, and found that people are almost as accurate with synthesized sounds as with real sounds. Second, we tested dynamic audio awareness in a realistic groupware scenario, and found that adding audio to a radar view significantly improved awareness of off-screen activities in situations where it was difficult to see or attend to the visual display. Our work provides new empirical evidence about the value of dynamic synthesized audio in distributed groupware.},

Our study suggests that success in these goals depends on how well they develop their social networks and how effectively they communicate within those networks. Effective communication is made more challenging by the need to strike a balance between sharing information related to specific needs and the desire to manage self-presentation. Based on these observations, we outline a set of design opportunities for future systems to support health-oriented social interactions online, including tools to help users shape their social networks and communicate effectively within those.},

Social navigation is further supported through pivot browsing from a consolidated history of user actions on an individual's files. Through usage log analysis over an 8-month period, we found that Cattail's novel network inference and social navigation features enabled a net gain of clickthroughs. Interviews with users revealed that this led to increased discovery of relevant people and content. We conclude with a discussion of several possible enhancements to the system.

Calling attention to class differences in technology use challenges the prevailing practice in human-computer interaction of designing for those similar to oneself, which often privileges middle-class values and practices.

 abstract = {This paper describes results from a large-scale survey to explore users' comfort with different styles of avatars for workplace communication. Thirty-one avatars were evaluated based on users' ratings along several dimensions and grouped into five different clusters. The highest rated cluster was the set of formal, realistic avatars that users did not feel were creepy. These avatars were ranked comparatively with webcam photos, and users felt that they would be appropriate for work. Our results also revealed that realism is nuanced, as avatars in another cluster were also rated high on realism, but were felt to be inappropriate for work. Finally, this work also demonstrates that people are more particular concerning which type of avatar they are represented by, compared to ones they interact with.},

 abstract = {The emergence of social networking services on the Internet has facilitated communication between people located far away from each other. Through a variety of Web services, people can get together on a virtual platform to video chat, edit documents, and engage in other activities; however, neighboring residents do not always have a chance to meet each other face-to-face. In our research, we focus on people living close to each other and try to encourage them to get together. We have attempted to encourage people to bring along their own ingredients to a get-together for cooking and eating according to "Osusowake," a traditional Japanese ritual. We propose a menu-planning support system that utilizes the shared information of cooking ingredients owned by individuals.},

 abstract = {Constraint can spur creativity. Approaching the 26th anniversary of the CSCW conference, we were asked to move the submission deadline two months earlier to reduce the reviewing conflict with CHI 2012. In response, we used the additional time to innovate and to increase participation while maintaining or increasing quality, by allowing authors to revise and resubmit their papers and notes. Conference attendees and proceedings readers will ultimately assess the outcome, but overall the feedback from associate chairs, reviewers and authors has been very positive. Submissions increased 57% from CSCW 2011 to a record 290 papers and 125 notes. We increased the program committee to 67 associate chairs (ACs) to handle them; 21 were women and 20 were from outside North America. They comprised representatives from computer science, social media and social networks, psychology, anthropology, software engineering, management, and design. Fifty were from universities. Our process most resembled a journal special issue, with a submission deadline, a team of four reviewers, and one revision cycle under a firm time constraint (in this case five weeks). Each submission was assigned to two committee members, designated AC-Coordinator and ACReviewer. Each AC assigned one external reviewer. In the first round, each paper or note was blind-reviewed by the AC-Reviewer and the two external reviewers. Reviewers assessed the likelihood that it could be revised within one month to be acceptable. Based on the outcomes, submissions were considered 'conditional accept' (CA, 8.7%), 'revise=resubmit' (RR, 46.5%) or 'reject' (44.8%). In general, papers that received one or more positive assessments were offered the opportunity to revise. Papers that had no positive assessment in the first round were rejected. We based this decision on an analysis of CSCW 2011 data, which revealed that submissions that did not get an advocate in the initial reviewing had 0% chance of acceptance. Sixty percent of CSCW 2011 submissions had no advocate, compared to 45% of CSCW 2012 submissions. The difference is that the CSCW 2012 submissions had a month in which they could be improved. By immediately rejecting the 45% that had no chance, we streamlined and focused the process, and reduced the number of reviews per submission despite the revision cycle. The AC Coordinator relied on the reviews in providing written guidance to authors on how to revise RRs. Authors of RR and CA submissions had five weeks to prepare a revision and an explanation of how they had addressed reviewer concerns. Resubmissions of RRs underwent a full second review from the same four-reviewer team; most CAs were checked by just one AC. Reviewing teams were strongly encouraged to resolve decisions prior to the program committee meeting and indeed, only 6% of initial submissions had to be discussed in the meeting. The program committee split into two subgroups followed by a plenary session to make the final decisions. 127 papers and 37 notes, 39.5% of initial submissions, reached acceptable quality through revision. This is almost twice the number presented in any previous CSCW, in part due to record submissions. ACs and reviewers nominated papers and notes for consideration for Best Paper awards; 4 were selected, with 17 awarded Honorable Mention. The accepted work represents diverse topics. Relatively new topics for CSCW include crowdsourcing, civic engagement, and social media; more traditional CSCW topics include distributed work, coordination, ethnography, and collaborative software development. This collaborative effort was an example of computer supported cooperative work. The entire CSCW community provided input throughout the process-many ideas and changes came from outside of the committee. Committee members had to adapt to new ways of working. Our analysis indicates that the work required of reviewers and associate chairs did not exceed that of past years, and authors benefited from two rounds of feedback from committed ACs and reviewers. Our goal was to maintain a high quality threshold while enabling more papers to reach that threshold. We believe there are many benefits to a review process with more opportunity for constructive interaction between reviewers and authors. Authors benefit by learning more about the CSCW culture, and by producing papers that are better than they could have produced on their own. Reviewers benefit by seeing their work lead to improved papers. The community benefits, because more of its members are successful at producing high quality research each year. As a community, we must consider new ways to assess conference quality-when a larger volume of high quality work is produced, older metrics no longer hold. Considering the fraction of submitted work that is of low quality to be a measure of conference quality is backwards. We need new measures of process quality and the resulting quality of accepted work. Through continued innovation, CSCW will remain the top venue for leading edge research on collaboration and technology. As with any new process, mistakes were made and much was learned. We look forward to participating as community members in ongoing innovation. The other technical tracks contribute immeasurably to the program. A record number of interactive posters will be presented. The 14 workshops drew a remarkable number of submissions. With demos, horizon, panels, videos, special sessions, and three plenary keynotes, CSCW 2012 is a great start to the second quarter-century of the CSCW conference.},
