Preliminary work has revealed that automation reduces workload; however, it also increases the potential for confusion, restricts flexibility, and may negatively impact the gaming experience. Through a series of laboratory studies, my dissertation research will investigate the impact on awareness and decision making processes of following three factors: 1) persistent display of automation results, 2) animation of automated actions, and 3) user control of automated actions. Finally, a field study is planned to deploy and validate the design concepts explored in the laboratory studies.},

We present an empirical evaluation consisting of three experiments aimed at investigating a few important issues of pen and touch interaction on horizontal surfaces. Specifically, we examine the compromise between speed and accuracy for the two input modalities in positioning and tracing contexts, the influence of palm-resting on pen precision and bimanual coordination for pen mode-switching via postures. We report on quantitative and qualitative results obtained from these trials and discuss their potential impact on the design of pen and touch systems.},

 abstract = {The increasing number of digital devices in our environment enriches how we interact with digital content. Yet, cross-device information transfer -- which should be a common operation -- is surprisingly difficult. One has to know which devices can communicate, what information they contain, and how information can be exchanged. To mitigate this problem, we formulate the gradual engagement design pattern that generalizes prior work in proxemic interactions and informs future system designs. The pattern describes how we can design device interfaces to gradually engage the user by disclosing connectivity and information exchange capabilities as a function of inter-device proximity. These capabilities flow across three stages: (1) awareness of device presence/connectivity, (2) reveal of exchangeable content, and (3) interaction methods for transferring content between devices tuned to particular distances and device capabilities. We illustrate how we can apply this pattern to design, and show how existing and novel interaction techniques for cross-device transfers can be integrated to flow across its various stages. We explore how techniques differ between personal and semi-public devices, and how the pattern supports interaction of multiple users.},

Participants used the interfaces to complete a series of tasks in which they interacted with a digital map of a fictitious city and then attempted to navigate through a corresponding virtual world. However, based on participant performance, we find no evidence that interface type affects navigation ability. We discuss map navigation strategies across the two conditions and analyze multi-touch gestures used by participants in the tabletop condition. Finally, based on these analyses, we consider implications for the design of interactive map interfaces.},

@proceedings{Shaer:2012:2396636,
 abstract = {We are pleased to welcome you to the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces (ITS) 2012, held from November 11-14th, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ITS 2012 marks the 7th anniversary of a series of annual research workshops and conferences that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia. In this short amount of time, the field of Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces has rapidly evolved. Hardware prices are falling, core sensing technology is improving, software toolkits are maturing, and interaction paradigms are beginning to solidify. As a result, interactive tabletops and surfaces are increasingly making their way beyond laboratories and appearing in a wide variety of private and public spaces including museums, offices, schools, airports, hotels, medical centers, and homes. Such surfaces employ a variety of technologies including capacitive sensing, computer vision, motion sensors, and appear in a variety of formfactors such as large walls and tabletops, tablets and slates, flexible materials, and on-demand projection. Sponsored by ACM and generously supported by National Science Foundation and industry, the ACM conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces brings together researchers and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds and interest areas. The intimate size of this singletrack symposium provides an ideal venue for leading researchers, practitioners, and students to exchange research results and experiences. This year we received 103 paper and note submissions (63 papers and 40 notes) of which we accepted 24 papers and 6 notes for an overall acceptance rate of 29%. We also introduced a new review process modeled after the 2012 ACM CSCW conference, in which papers and notes underwent two review cycles. After the first review by two external reviewers and one program committee member, submissions received either a "Revise" or "Reject" decision. Authors of papers in the "Revise" pool then participated in a second phase of the submission process, in which they had 31/2 weeks to revise and resubmit their work based on the initial reviews (and also received an additional meta-review from a second program committee member). Revised submissions were then re-reviewed as the basis for final decisions. This is similar to a journal review process, except that it is limited to one revision with a strict deadline. We believe that this process has resulted in an extremely high quality papers and notes program, which we hope that you find enlightening and exciting! In addition to the papers and notes program, the conference hosts several other programs. The Doctoral Symposium (DS) accepted seven doctoral students to discuss their research with peers and with a panel of experienced ITS researchers in an informal setting. The conference also includes an interactive hands-on reception that presents a juried selection of 21 posters and 18 demos. This year, ITS brings the theme of Beyond Flat Displays in our pre-conference venues with a tutorial and a workshop: four tutorials that offer novel practical experiences to conference attendees with diverse skills and backgrounds, and a pre-conference workshop that will challenge attendees to explore the realm Beyond Flat Displays. The National Science Foundation extends generous support for DS attendees and for student travel awards; this support will result in more opportunities for students to engage in this diverse and growing community. The titles of the papers, notes, posters, and demos, reflect the diversity of ideas and perspectives that comprise the ITS community, ranging from large tabletop surfaces to non-flat displays, from pen and paper to free-space interaction, from education to surfaces "in the wild". What brings it all together is a commitment to innovation that expands our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications.},

We characterize such enticement from the system interface as the system's discoverability. A particular challenge to modern surface interfaces is the discoverability of system functionality: does the system require gestures? are there system menus? if so, how are they invoked? This research focuses on the discoverability of system menus on digital tabletops designed for public settings. An observational study of menu invocation methods in a museum setting is reported. Study findings suggest that discernible and recognizable interface elements, such as buttons, supported by the use of animation, can effectively attract and guide the discovery of menus. Design recommendations for improving menu discoverability are also presented.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in touch and display technologies are supporting a wide-spread use of touch-based direct manipulation techniques as well as 3D displays that give a perspectively correct view. Both techniques have consistency constraints including the following: With direct manipulation, a dragged object should stick to the finger tip. With viewer centered projection, head movement should update the scene's projection to preserve a sound 3D impression, e.g., leaning around a house should reveal its backyard. Unfortunately, these two contradict each other, making a combination, e.g., moving the head while touching or dragging an object, non-trivial. We introduce a design space of perspectively adjusted methods for direct manipulation to cope with this limitation, select nine different strategies from it, and evaluate six of them in depth. Participants dragged a box through a 3D maze with multiple, partially occluded levels. We identified one method to be among the fastest while yielding up to 32% less collisions than the other fast methods.},

Sometimes smart phones can be carried into a bathroom but it is unnatural to be holding a device at during bathing, so a suitable technique for information browsing in a bathing environment is required. We propose an interactive water surface display system, which uses image-recognition techniques. By using water, the system can perform an intuitive interaction peculiar to water such as poking a finger up from under the water surface, stroking the water surface and scooping up water. In this paper, we discuss interaction design in a bathroom, describing an implementation of our system and its applications.},

This year ITS received a total of 121 valid submissions including 86 papers and 35 notes; this represents an increase of 16% over last year. Of these submissions, 27 papers and 8 notes were accepted, resulting in an overall acceptance rate of 29%--close to last year's, but with an increase in the number of accepted submissions (5 more than last year, or a 17% increase). The number and quality of this year's submissions cement ITS's reputation as the leading venue for work on interactive surfaces and highlight the increasing relevance of this area within Human-Computer Interaction. In response to feedback from the community, this is the first time that the conference has included application papers as a distinct type of paper or note. The response has been outstanding. We received an abundance of high quality application paper submissions from industry and academia that bridge research and practice and provide valuable insights from real-world deployments. Application papers accepted this year are part of the regular program and are distinguishable by an indication on the first page. The peer review process for both application and academic papers was rigorous: all papers received at least two reviews by external experts and one review by a member of the committee. A large number of papers received also additional reviews, meta-reviews, and full reviews by a second member of the committee. The application paper review process differed from the academic review process in two respects. First, application reviews were guided by a set of five questions that brought attention to the domain of the application, the design process, the integration of multiple existing technologies, and practical issues derived from the implementation and deployment of surfaces in a real-world context. Second, application papers received more reviews from members of the ITS community outside of academia.},

However, applying traditional WIMP interfaces to tabletops causes problems where users cannot reach GUI elements, such as icons or buttons, on the opposite side with their hands, and they sometimes have difficulty in reading the content of GUI elements because their view does not match the orientation of the content. To solve these problems, we present HandyWidgets that are widgets localized around users' hands. The widgets are quickly invoked by a bimanual multi-touch gesture which we call "pull-out". This gesture also allows users to adjust the position, orientation, and size of the widgets, in a continuous manner after invocation.},

Although this combination has the potential to provide more intuitive and natural interaction setups for a wide range of applications, until now interaction with such systems is mainly constrained to simple navigation, whereas manipulation of the stereoscopically displayed objects is supported only rather rudimentarily. In this paper we investigate the users' ability to discriminate depth or depth motion of stereoscopically rendered objects while she is performing touch gestures and discuss implications for object selection and manipulation. Our results show that there is a usable range of imperceptible manipulation, which - if properly applied - could support interaction with objects floating in the vicinity around the display surface without noticeable impact on a user's visual or touch performance.},

The potential of combining the mobile and the projected display and further the potential of the mid-air space between them have yet to be explored. In this paper we assess these potentials by reporting two user studies: First, an experimental comparison of four techniques for target selection on the projection, including interaction on the touchscreen of the projector phone as well as performing pointing gestures in mid-air around the phone. Our results indicate that interacting behind the phone yields the highest performance, albeit showing a twice as high error rate. Second, a follow-up experiment where we analyzed the performance of the two best tech-niques of the first study within realistic mobile application scenarios such as browsing and gaming. The results show that mobile applications benefit from the projection, e.g., by overcoming the fat-finger problem on touchscreens and increasing the visibility of small objects. Our findings speak for the integration of a tracking camera at the bottom of the projector phone to enable mid-air pointing interaction.},

We present a study of children and adults performing touch and surface gesture interaction tasks on mobile devices. We identify challenges related to (a) intentional and unintentional touches outside of onscreen targets and (b) recognition of drawn gestures, that both indicate a need to design tailored interaction for children to accommodate and overcome these challenges.},

Towards achieving such transitions for collaborative exploration and search, we propose a protocol based on managing revisions for each collaborator exploring a dataset. The protocol allows participants to diverge from the shared analysis path (branch), study the data independently (explore), and then contribute back their findings onto the shared display (merge). We apply this concept to collaborative search in multidimensional data, and propose an implementation where the public view is a tabletop display and the private views are embedded in handheld tablets. We then use this implementation to perform a qualitative user study involving a real estate dataset. Results show that participants leverage the BEM protocol, spend \ significant time using their private views (40% to 80% of total task time), and apply public view changes for consultation with collaborators.},

One important feature of Tangible Windows is that the use of obtrusive hardware, such as HMDs, is strictly avoided. Instead, lightweight paper-based displays are used.

Examples include joint planning of events (e.g., holidays) or deciding on a shared purchase (e.g., a present for a common friend). However, this usually implies that all interactions with information happen on the common display. This is in contrast to the current practices to use personal devices and further, most people's behavior to constantly switch between individual and group phases because people have differing search strategies, preferences, etc. We therefore investigated how the combination of personal devices and a simple way of exchanging information between these devices and an interactive surface changes the way people solve collaborative tasks compared to an existing approach of using personal devices. Our study results clearly indicate that the combination of personal and a shared device allows users to fluently switch between individual and group work phases and users take advantage of both device classes.},

The paper details our current prototype implementation and discusses results of a design critique conducted with domain experts using our system, helping us assess the potential of tabletop interfaces as aids in the process of collision reconstruction, as well as delineate and discuss relevant design implications.},

In this study, we analyzed perceived intensity levels of tactile sensation that can be utilized in clicking or tapping gesture on touchscreen. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the number of perceived intensity levels. The first was to find the range of accelerations for our new haptic device. The second experiment was to measure the number of intensity levels that can be reliably identified in the acceleration ranges. Four stimuli were used in this experiment. The result showed average information transfer of 1.34 bits for intensity identification, or equivalently, 2.53 correctly identifiable intensity levels.},

The primary tasks identified from the participants in the study were collaboration, visualization and data analysis. This research will further analyze the tasks, with respect to urban planners and consider the properties of various multi-touch displays to explore the role of multi-touch displays in the GIS context.},

Because the touch panel has a space over which a finger and a corresponding cursor moves, certain actions become intuitive compared to force input-type devices such as a pointing stick. If we could add an illusory feeling of finger motion with the force input interface, it would become more intuitive. We have found a new haptic illusion of "motion", which occurs when an electrical tactile flow is presented on the fingertip while experiencing a shearing force. We have also investigated occurrence conditions, focusing on the relation between shear force and movement speed of the electrical tactile stimulation. In our study, we investigated directional characteristic focusing on the illusory position of the finger perceived using a new electrocutaneous display mounted on a six-axis force sensor.},

Such techniques allow people to control these devices by performing hand gestures in the air. In this paper, we present a method of extending interactions into the space above a multitouch surface using only a standard diffused surface illumination (DSI) device, without any additional sensors. Then we focus on interaction techniques for activating graphical widgets located in this above-surface space. We have conducted a study to elicit gestures for above-table widget activation. A follow-up study was conducted to evaluate and compare these gestures based on their performance. Our results showed that there was no clear agreement on what gestures should be used to select objects in mid-air, and that performance was better when using gestures that were chosen less frequently, but predicted to be better by the designers, as opposed to those most frequently suggested by participants.},

By placing hands or arms on the surface, visitors can add environmental barriers, thus interrupting the genetic flow between the separated populations. This results in sub-populations that accumulate genetic differences independently over time, sometimes leading to the formation of new species.

 abstract = {Typing on a touchscreen display usually lacks haptic feedback which is crucial for maintaining finger to key assignment, especially for touch typists who are not looking at their keyboard. This leads to typing being substantially more error prone on these devices. We present a soft keyboard model which we developed from typing data collected from users with diverging typing behavior. For data acquisition, we used a simulated perfect classifier we refer to as The Keyboard of Oz. In order to draw near to this classifier we used the complete sensor data of each keystroke and applied supervised machine learning techniques to learn and evaluate an individual keyboard model. The model not only accounts for individual keystroke distributions but also incorporates a classifier based on the images obtained from an optical touch sensor. The resulting highly individual classifier has remarkable classification accuracy. Additionally, we present an approach to compensate for hand drift during typing utilizing a Kalman filter. We show that this filter performs significantly better with the keyboard model which takes raw sensor data into account.},

 abstract = {We propose a new approach for touch detection on optical multi-touch devices that exploits the fact that the camera images reveal not only the actual touch points, but also objects above the screen such as the hand or arm of a user. Our touch processing relies on the Maximally Stable Extremal Regions algorithm for finding the users' fingertips in the camera image. The hierarchical structure of the generated extremal regions serves as a starting point for agglomerative clustering of the fingertips into hands. Furthermore, we suggest a heuristic supporting the identification of individual fingers as well as the distinction between left hands and right hands if all five fingers of a hand are in contact with the touch surface. Our evaluation confirmed that the system is robust against detection errors resulting from non-uniform illumination and reliably assigns touch points to individual hands based on the implicitly tracked context information. The efficient multithreaded implementation handles two-handed input from multiple users in real-time.},

Our protocol depends on high-resolution measurements of finger motions. This was achieved by the means of two optical finger trackers specially developed for this study. The trackers provide stable and precise measurements of finger translations and rotations. We used them in two user experiments that revealed that (a) user's precision for linear pointing is about 150dpi or 0.17mm, and (b) user can reliably point at sectors as narrow as 2.76 degrees in 2s in rotational pointing. Our results provide new information for the optimization of interactions and sensing devices that involve finger pointing on a surface.},

ITS 2011 is the 6th event in a series of annual research workshops and conferences that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia as "Table-top", and has subsequently traveled around the world (Tabletop 2007 in Newport, RI, USA; Tabletop and Interactive Surfaces (TIS) 2008 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, the ACM International Conference ITS 2009 in Banff, Canada, and the ACM International Conference ITS 2010 in Saarbrücken, Germany). ITS has also broadened in scope beyond its original focus on horizontal computer systems and it becomes a premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of new and emerging tabletop and interactive surface technologies. As a still young and very active community, we embrace the growth of the discipline in a wide variety of areas, including innovations in ITS hardware, software, interaction design, and studies expanding our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications in modern society. ITS 2011 will bring together top researchers and practitioners who are interested in both the technical and human aspects of interactive tabletop and surface technologies. As in the last year, ITS 2011 has added a separate day for a doctoral symposium and tutorials before the main conference. We also have co-located workshop Dexis 2011 on November 13th, focusing on the use of interactive surfaces for visual data exploration. We received 96 full paper and note submissions (56 papers and 40 notes) this year. After a thorough review process, the program committee accepted 32 submissions (acceptance rate of 33.3% in total), which include 19 papers (33.9%) and 13 notes (32.5%). Each anonymous submission was assigned primary and secondary program committee members. The primary committee member assigned at least two external reviewers for each submission, and the secondary at least one. After receiving the reviews, both program committee members wrote a meta-review for every submission. The program committee then met in Redmond, WA, USA on August 25 and 26, 2011, to examine each submission and select the top papers. At that moment all acceptances were conditional and they were finally accepted only after the authors provided a final revision addressing the committee's comments.},

This weight offers a supplemental channel to provide information about graphical objects without cluttering the visual display. To create such a pseudo-weight illusion on a passive device, the pressure applied with the fingers during the interaction has to be captured. We show that this pressure can be estimated without hardware modification on some touch sensitive tabletop setups (e.g., MERL's DiamondTouch). Two controlled experiments show that pseudo-weight is perceived effectively. The first one demonstrates that users, without training and without previous knowledge of the system, can accurately rank virtual objects according to their pseudo-weights, provided they are sufficiently distinct. The second controlled experiment investigates more formally the relation between the pseudo-weight and the actual perception of the users.},

 abstract = {Multi-display environments (MDEs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, incorporating multi-touch tabletops, tablets, wall displays and even position tracking systems. Designers have proposed a variety of interesting gestures for use in an MDE, some of which involve a user moving their hands, arms, body or even a device itself. These gestures are often used as part of interactions to move data between the various components of an MDE, which is a longstanding research problem. But designers, not users, have created most of these gestures and concerns over implementation issues such as recognition may have influenced their design. We performed a user study to elicit these gestures directly from users, but found a low level of convergence among the gestures produced. This lack of agreement is important and we discuss its possible causes and the implication it has for designers. To assist designers, we present the most prevalent gestures and some of the underlying conceptual themes behind them. We also provide analysis of how certain factors such as distance and device type impact the choice of gestures and discuss how to apply them to real-world systems.},

One continuing challenge is to support fluid interaction with both paper and digital media, while taking advantage of established practices with each. Today researchers are exploiting depth cameras and computer vision to capture activity on and above the desktop and enable direct interaction with digitally projected and physical media. One important prerequisite to augmenting desktop activity is understanding human behavior in particular contexts and tasks. Here we study active reading on the desktop. To better understand active reading practices and identify patterns that might serve as signatures for different types of related activity, we conducted a microanalysis of single users reading on and above the desktop workspace. We describe the relationship between multimodal body-based contextual cues and the interactions they signify in a physical desktop workspace. Detailed analysis of coordinated interactions with paper documents provides an empirical basis for designing digitally augmented desktop workspaces. We conclude with prototype design interactions for hybrid paper-digital desktop workspaces.},
