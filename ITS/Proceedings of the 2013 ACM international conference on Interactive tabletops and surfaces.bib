 abstract = {The process of oil and gas exploration and its result, the decision to drill for oil in a specific location, relies on a number of distinct but related domains. These domains require effective collaboration to come to a decision that is both cost effective and maintains the integrity of the environment. As we show in this paper, many of the existing technologies and practices that support the oil and gas exploration process overlook fundamental user issues such as collaboration, interaction and visualization. The work presented in this paper is based upon a design process that involved expert users from an oil and gas exploration firm in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. We briefly present knowledge of the domain and how it informed the design of SkyHunter, a prototype multi-surface environment to support oil and gas exploration. This paper highlights our current prototype and we conclude with a reflection on multi-surface interactions and environments in this domain.},

 abstract = {Acquired brain injury, mostly caused by stroke, is one main cause for adult disability, often involving cognitive impairment. Neuro-rehabilitation aims at treating these impairments by maximizing the effect of brain plasticity and functional reorganization. Specific exercises help patients to regain skills that have temporarily been lost. Yet, conventional training can involve disadvantages, e.g., the setup of an individual training environment causes a lot of effort, the computation of statistics is time-consuming and must be done by therapists manually, and it is usually not possible to discreetly adapt the level of difficulty of an exercise. Further, software solutions for desktop PCs often do not lead to the desirable results because they are too distinct from the conventional therapy setting. The fun.tast.tisch.~project introduces a tabletop-based training system for the application in neuro-rehabilitation. This system should not only come close to the conventional setting but also overcome problems involved in existing solutions. The paper introduces the project, describes its first module Tangram, and summarizes the results of a small-scale study conducted to evaluate the module with the help of therapists and patients at an early stage of development.},

 abstract = {We are pleased to welcome you to the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces (ITS) 2012, held from November 11-14th, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ITS 2012 marks the 7th anniversary of a series of annual research workshops and conferences that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia. In this short amount of time, the field of Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces has rapidly evolved. Hardware prices are falling, core sensing technology is improving, software toolkits are maturing, and interaction paradigms are beginning to solidify. As a result, interactive tabletops and surfaces are increasingly making their way beyond laboratories and appearing in a wide variety of private and public spaces including museums, offices, schools, airports, hotels, medical centers, and homes. Such surfaces employ a variety of technologies including capacitive sensing, computer vision, motion sensors, and appear in a variety of formfactors such as large walls and tabletops, tablets and slates, flexible materials, and on-demand projection. Sponsored by ACM and generously supported by National Science Foundation and industry, the ACM conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces brings together researchers and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds and interest areas. The intimate size of this singletrack symposium provides an ideal venue for leading researchers, practitioners, and students to exchange research results and experiences. This year we received 103 paper and note submissions (63 papers and 40 notes) of which we accepted 24 papers and 6 notes for an overall acceptance rate of 29%. We also introduced a new review process modeled after the 2012 ACM CSCW conference, in which papers and notes underwent two review cycles. After the first review by two external reviewers and one program committee member, submissions received either a "Revise" or "Reject" decision. Authors of papers in the "Revise" pool then participated in a second phase of the submission process, in which they had 31/2 weeks to revise and resubmit their work based on the initial reviews (and also received an additional meta-review from a second program committee member). Revised submissions were then re-reviewed as the basis for final decisions. This is similar to a journal review process, except that it is limited to one revision with a strict deadline. We believe that this process has resulted in an extremely high quality papers and notes program, which we hope that you find enlightening and exciting! In addition to the papers and notes program, the conference hosts several other programs. The Doctoral Symposium (DS) accepted seven doctoral students to discuss their research with peers and with a panel of experienced ITS researchers in an informal setting. The conference also includes an interactive hands-on reception that presents a juried selection of 21 posters and 18 demos. This year, ITS brings the theme of Beyond Flat Displays in our pre-conference venues with a tutorial and a workshop: four tutorials that offer novel practical experiences to conference attendees with diverse skills and backgrounds, and a pre-conference workshop that will challenge attendees to explore the realm Beyond Flat Displays. The National Science Foundation extends generous support for DS attendees and for student travel awards; this support will result in more opportunities for students to engage in this diverse and growing community. The titles of the papers, notes, posters, and demos, reflect the diversity of ideas and perspectives that comprise the ITS community, ranging from large tabletop surfaces to non-flat displays, from pen and paper to free-space interaction, from education to surfaces "in the wild". What brings it all together is a commitment to innovation that expands our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications.},

@proceedings{Dachselt:2014:2669485,
 abstract = {We are very happy to welcome you to the ninth ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces, held November 16-19, 2014 in Dresden, Germany. Since its inauguration as the Tabletop Workshop in 2006, the conference series has been devoted to an exploration of new approaches for the design, development and use of emerging tabletop and interactive surface technologies. The nine years over which the conference has been held have seen a tremendous evolution in technologies supporting surface-based interaction, leading this year's program to include a range of novel topics around the use of both horizontal and vertical surfaces, mobile surfaces in various sizes, mixed-surface interaction, and embodied interaction around the many displays that surround us. The city of Dresden, also described as 'Florence on the river Elbe', serves as an appropriate location for the study of interactive surfaces. Dresden is a historic city of culture and beautiful architecture, hosting stunning art treasures and one of the world's finest symphony orchestras. This cultural and musical heritage represents the tradition of interacting with our world around us, while at the same time Dresden is a thriving modern city on the forefront of technological advances. It is the home of Europe's largest micro-electronics cluster, of the Technische Universität Dresden as one of Germany's elite universities and a city densely populated by numerous research institutions in key areas such as information and communication technology, new-generation materials and biotechnology. Therefore, held in a city of science and culture, ITS 2014 will focus on the culture of interaction, thereby reflecting that interactive surfaces have become part of our everyday life and culture. Since its earliest days ITS has involved partnership between industry and academia, and this is as true as ever in 2014, which features a strong selection of papers devoted both to pure research and to concrete application of surface technologies. This year, the conference received 112 paper and note submissions from all over the world, of which 31 were selected, for an acceptance rate of 27.7%. The peer-review process was rigorous, with a remarkable team of 35 research and industry leaders ensuring that each submission was reviewed fairly and by the most appropriate reviewers. Papers submitted to ITS received this year a total of 435 reviews and meta-reviews. Acting on the community's feedback, we have kept the "review and resubmit" system for those papers which offered excellent contributions but needed some further work and feedback to get to the high quality and originality level expected of ITS work. The application review process has also matured; this process allows contributions that have a practical relevance for practitioners and have been explored in real settings to be fully represented. A traditional highlight of ITS is its demonstration session, held on the first night of the main conference. The demo session serves to showcase novel technologies, an enormous range of inspiring ideas of the use of interactive surfaces, and provides lively opportunity for exchange of ideas, techniques and experience. This year's session includes 14 demonstrations from academic presenters plus several industrial exhibits. In addition, the ITS poster session will allow early access to work in progress, with 23 posters presented. Six students are presenting their work in the Doctoral Symposium. We are especially grateful to Sheelagh Carpendale, James D. Hollan and Andy Wilson, who will give invaluable advice to the students in the panel of experts. A collection of studios, tutorials and workshops allow focused work on cutting-edge topics such as personal fabrication, collaboration or tactile interaction prior to the main conference. We welcome two distinguished keynotes. The opening plenary will be presented by Professor Jun Rekimoto of the University of Tokyo and Sony Computer Science Laboratories, on "A New You: From Augmented Reality to the Augmented Human". The closing keynote will be delivered by Professor Joachim Sauter of the University of the Arts in Berlin and co-founder of ART+COM, on "Sensitive Skins in Media Art and Design". We are highly grateful to our sponsor ACM SIGCHI and the corporate supporters, without whom the conference would not have been possible. The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) provided a highly-generous platinum level of sponsorship. Our lead industrial partners are Multitouch at the Gold level, SMART Technologies and WACOM at the Silver level, Microsoft and SurfNet at the Bronze level, and GRAND Network of Centres of Excellence as a Friend of ITS.},

Touch systems exhibit notable amount of latencies, but it is seldom characterized, probably because latency estimation is a difficult and time consuming undertaking. In this paper, we introduce two novel approaches to estimate the latency of touch systems. Both approaches require an operator to slide a finger on the touch surface, and provide automatic processing of the recorded data. The High Accuracy (HA) approach requires an external camera and careful calibration, but provides a large sample set of accurate latency estimations. The Low Overhead (LO) approach, while not offering as much accuracy as the HA approach, does not require any additional equipment and is implemented in a few lines of code. In a set of experiments, we show that the HA approach can generate a highly detailed picture of the latency distribution of the system, and that the LO approach provides average latency estimates no further than 4 ms from the HA estimate.},

There are multiple uses for this gesture--zooming and scaling being the most common--but little is known about the factors affecting performance and ergonomics of the gesture motion itself. In this note, we present the results from a study where we manipulated angle, direction, distance, and position of two-finger pinch gestures. The study provides insight into how variables interact with each other to affect performance and how certain combinations of pinch gesture characteristics can result in uncomfortable or difficult pinch gestures. Our results can help designers select faster pinch gestures and avoid difficult pinch tasks.},

We compile design requirements for occlusion-aware tabletop systems and conduct the first in-depth user study comparing ObjecTop with conventional tabletop interfaces in search and layout tasks. The empirical results show that occlusion-aware techniques outperform the conventional tabletop interface. Furthermore, our findings indicate that physical properties of occluders dramatically influence which strategy users employ to cope with occlusion.

Accordingly, a number of these guidelines for single-tabletop settings need to be extended to take account of both the distinctive qualities of the classroom and the particular challenges of having various groups using the same application on multiple tables simultaneously. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of designs for small-group multi-tabletop collaborative learning activities in the wild. We use distributed cognition as a framework to analyze the small number of authentic multi-tabletop deployments and help characterize the technological and educational ecology of these classroom settings. Based on previous research on single-tabletop collaboration, the concept of orchestration, and both first-hand experience and second-hand accounts of the few existing multiple-tabletop deployments to date, we develop a three-dimensional framework of design recommendations for multi-tabletop learning settings.},

 abstract = {We propose a tabletop keyboard that assists stroke patients in using computers. Using computers for purposes such as paying bills, managing bank accounts, sending emails, etc., which all include typing, is part of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) that stroke patients wish to recover. To date, stroke rehabilitation research has greatly focused on using computer-assisted technology for rehabilitation. However, working with computers as a skill that patients need to recover has been neglected. The conventional human computer interfaces are mouse and keyboard. Using keyboard stays the main challenge for hemiplegic stroke patients because typing is usually a bimanual task. Therefore, we propose an assistive tabletop keyboard which is not only a novel computer interface that is specially designed to facilitate patient-computer interaction but also a rehab medium through which patients practice the desired arm/hand functions.},

In addition, our user evaluations to observe the robustness and the performance of the system indicate that the system is detects touch at acceptably high speeds.

Important information such as operating units or hazards is usually shown on these maps. Arranging the huge amount of in-formation can be challenging for operators, as this information should always be visible while not occluding im-portant regions of the underlying geographic map. As large interactive whiteboards are increasingly replacing tradition-al analog maps, new ways to assist with arranging information can be provided. In this paper, we present a new approach for placing annotations automatically on top of a map. For finding the optimal placement, our metrics are based on geographic features, on the users' sketched input, and on the annotations geometry itself. Moreover, we also added additional features to minimize occlusions for multiple annotations. First results were highly promising and showed that our approach improves input performance while keeping an optimal view of the map.},

In the present embodied trans-surface interaction technique, a peripheral NFC tag array provides tangible affordances for connecting mobile devices to positions on a collaborative surface. Touching a tag initiates a trans-surface portal. Each portal visually associates a mobile device and its user with a place on the collaborative surface. The portal's manifestation at the top of the mobile device supports 'flicking over' interaction, like playing cards. The technique is simple, inexpensive, reliable, scalable, and generally applicable for co-located collaboration.

 abstract = {This paper presents the design and development of a novel visual+haptic device that co-locates 3D stereo visualization, direct touch and touch force sensing with a robotically actuated display. Our actuated immersive 3D display, called TouchMover, is capable of providing 1D movement (up to 36cm) and force feedback (up to 230N) in a single dimension, perpendicular to the screen plane. In addition to describing the details of our design, we showcase how TouchMover allows the user to: 1) interact with 3D objects by pushing them on the screen with realistic force feedback, 2) touch and feel the contour of a 3D object, 3) explore and annotate volumetric medical images (e.g., MRI brain scans) and 4) experience different activation forces and stiffness when interacting with common 2D on-screen elements (e.g., buttons). We also contribute the results of an experiment which demonstrates the effectiveness of the haptic output of our device. Our results show that people are capable of disambiguating between 10 different 3D shapes with the same 2D footprint by touching alone and without any visual feedback (85% recognition rate, 12 participants).},

 abstract = {Acquired brain injury, mostly caused by stroke, is one main cause for adult disability, often involving cognitive impairment. Neuro-rehabilitation aims at treating these impairments by maximizing the effect of brain plasticity and functional reorganization. Specific exercises help patients to regain skills that have temporarily been lost. Yet, conventional training can involve disadvantages, e.g., the setup of an individual training environment causes a lot of effort, the computation of statistics is time-consuming and must be done by therapists manually, and it is usually not possible to discreetly adapt the level of difficulty of an exercise. Further, software solutions for desktop PCs often do not lead to the desirable results because they are too distinct from the conventional therapy setting. The fun.tast.tisch.~project introduces a tabletop-based training system for the application in neuro-rehabilitation. This system should not only come close to the conventional setting but also overcome problems involved in existing solutions.},

We present the design of an interactive event timeline that aims to improve situation awareness in tabletop systems that use automation. Our timeline enables exploration and analysis of automated system actions in a collaborative environment. We discuss two factors in the design of the timeline: the ownership of the timeline in multi-user situations and the location of the detailed visual feedback resulting from interaction with the timeline.

Despite many advantages compared to projector-based floor interaction systems, LED-based systems could be criticized for lacking the resolution for a worthwhile interactive experience. User studies of both simulated and real hardware are reported on. This includes a comparison of tiles of different resolution that suggests that pixel density, over the range of tests, is less important than visual artifacts introduced by carpet tile edges. Contrary to initial expectations, denser LED spacing did not improve legibility or raise user preferences. Overall our studies suggest that LED-based floor interaction can be legible and effective in a walk-up and use situation.},

Each of the Cube's launch applications was designed and delivered by an independent team, while the overall vision of the Cube was shepherded by a small executive team. The diversity of design, implementation and integration approaches pursued by these five teams provides some insight into the challenges, and opportunities, presented when working with large distributed interaction technologies.

Of these submissions, 27 papers and 8 notes were accepted, resulting in an overall acceptance rate of 29%--close to last year's, but with an increase in the number of accepted submissions (5 more than last year, or a 17% increase). The number and quality of this year's submissions cement ITS's reputation as the leading venue for work on interactive surfaces and highlight the increasing relevance of this area within Human-Computer Interaction. In response to feedback from the community, this is the first time that the conference has included application papers as a distinct type of paper or note. The response has been outstanding. We received an abundance of high quality application paper submissions from industry and academia that bridge research and practice and provide valuable insights from real-world deployments. Application papers accepted this year are part of the regular program and are distinguishable by an indication on the first page. The peer review process for both application and academic papers was rigorous: all papers received at least two reviews by external experts and one review by a member of the committee. A large number of papers received also additional reviews, meta-reviews, and full reviews by a second member of the committee. The application paper review process differed from the academic review process in two respects. First, application reviews were guided by a set of five questions that brought attention to the domain of the application, the design process, the integration of multiple existing technologies, and practical issues derived from the implementation and deployment of surfaces in a real-world context. Second, application papers received more reviews from members of the ITS community outside of academia.},

PointPose is a prototype that performs finger pose estimation at the location of touch using a short-range depth sensor viewing the touch screen of a mobile device. We present an algorithm that extracts finger rotation and tilt from a point cloud generated by a depth sensor oriented towards the device's touchscreen. The results of two user studies we conducted show that finger pose information can be extracted reliably using our proposed method. We show this for controlling rotation and tilt axes separately and also for combined input tasks using both axes. With the exception of the depth sensor, which is mounted directly on the mobile device, our approach does not require complex external tracking hardware, and, furthermore, external computation is unnecessary as the finger pose extraction algorithm can run directly on the mobile device. This makes PointPose ideal for prototyping and developing novel mobile user interfaces that use finger pose estimation.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the performance and experience differences between direct touch and mouse input on horizontal and vertical surfaces using a simple application and several validated scales. We find that, not only are both speed and accuracy improved when using the multi-touch display over a mouse, but that participants were happier and more engaged. They also felt more competent, in control, related to other people, and immersed. Surprisingly, these results cannot be explained by the intuitiveness of the controller, and the benefits of touch did not come at the expense of perceived workload. Our work shows the added value of considering experience in addition to traditional measures of performance, and demonstrates an effective and efficient method for gathering experience during inter-action with surface applications. We conclude by discussing how an understanding of this experience can help in designing touch applications.},

In this paper, we illustrate how pen and touch interaction techniques can be leveraged for editing and authoring of presentational documents on digital tabletops. Our system exploits the rich interactional vocabulary afforded by the simultaneous availability of the two modalities to provide gesture-driven document editing functionality as an expert alternative to widgets. For our bimanual gestures, we make use of non-dominant hand postures to set pen modes in which the dominant hand articulates a variety of transactions. We draw an analogy between such modifier postures and modifier keys on a keyboard to construct command shortcuts. Based on this model, we implement a number of common document editing operations, including several page and element manipulations, shape and text input with styling, clipart retrieval and insertion as well as undo/redo. The results of a lab study provide in-sights as to the strengths and limitations of our approach.},

It has been shown that geographic information systems can improve the efficiency of disaster management operations. However, workstation-based solutions fail to offer the same ease of collaboration as the large analog maps currently in use. Recent research prototypes, which use interactive tabletops for this purpose, often do not consider individual roles and the need for accountability of actions. In this paper, we present coMAP, a system built for interactive tabletops that facilitates collaborative situation analysis and planning in crisis management teams. Users can interact with coMAP using multi-touch as well as pen input. The latter is realized by new methods for the use of Anoto digital pens without the Anoto microdot pattern. A pen-optimized pie menu provides access to role-specific information and system functions. A combination of role-based access control and indoor tracking via Bluetooth is used to support accountability of actions while still allowing collaboration and information sharing. Initial user feedback for our system shows promising results.},

This paper introduces an asymmetric bimanual interaction technique that makes browser-based multi-touch gestures more expressive. In the proposed TouchModifier technique, a semi-transparent panel with modifier controls is docked to the side of the screen. The non-dominant hand operates the side panel, while the dominant hand interacts with the application content as usual. The controls on the side panel operate as fluid mode selectors that enrich and override the semantics of the dominant hand gestures. This opens novel interaction possibilities in browser applications, while remaining interoperable with existing web pages.

 abstract = {After the Fukushima nuclear accident, means to mitigate the severe situation have been proposed in many countries. One of those means is the mobile control room in which operators can monitor and control the damaged facilities from remote locations. The mobile control room is different from usual main control rooms of nuclear power plants in aspects of the quantity of transmitted information and the size of room space. A new type of operator interface for the mobile control room is required as operator tasks are reduced but more critical. A prototype of operator interface which aims to provide direct perception and manipulation function is shown in this presentation. The operator interface runs on 3D environment and is being developed on a touch device-SUR40. Currently, navigation from a site to a unit, zooming in/out for monitoring the overall status of facilities and diagnosing faulty components and controlling active components can be carried out through this prototype.},

On this basis a user can pan through a spatial user interface by adjusting her position at the table. As a natural form of interaction, this technique is convenient and applicable to many existing use cases and applic's navigational and spatial memory performance. We conducted an experiment between a common touch panning and a body panning interface to find out about differences in these performances. For the body panning condition, we observed an increased spatial memory performance and an invariant navigation performance.

Results showed that physical controls were the fastest and required the least eye fixation time on the controls, while the overlay improved performance when compared to touch alone. Speed and accuracy differences were seen primarily for dial controls; there was little difference between input conditions for sliders. These results confirm the value of physical input devices for parameter control tasks. They also reveal that overlays can provide some of the same benefits, making them a suitable input approach for certain applications where physical controls are impractical.},

In the present embodied trans-surface interaction technique, a peripheral NFC tag array provides tangible affordances for connecting mobile devices to positions on a collaborative surface. Touching a tag initiates a trans-surface portal. Each portal visually associates a mobile device and its user with a place on the collaborative surface. The portal's manifestation at the top of the mobile device supports 'flicking over' interaction, like playing cards. The technique is simple, inexpensive, reliable, scalable, and generally applicable for co-located collaboration.

 abstract = {Integrating digital tabletops into homes or desktop environments will give rise to a set of problems emerging from placing everyday objects on interactive tabletops. Chief among them is the arbitrary placement of physical objects that considerably limits the digital working space on the surface of tabletops. In this paper we contribute PeriTop, an interactive back-projected tabletop system which exploit the surface of physical objects and tabletop rims as additional interactive displays to represent and interact with digital objects. This is realized by augmenting the tabletop system with an inexpensive pico projector-depth camera pair. We support the PeriTop approach by depicting several salient use case scenarios aiding users in performing activities on hybrid physical-digital tabletop settings.},
