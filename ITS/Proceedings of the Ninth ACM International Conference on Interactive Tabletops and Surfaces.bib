 abstract = {Annotating documents is one of the indispensable interaction between human and documents. The annotation system of electronic documents enables to implement effective functions, such as information retrieval and annotation-based navigation, by using the annotation information; however, traditional systems require users to perform gestures in addition to common gestures for paper-based documents. This can reduce "learnability" of the system. We propose an intelligent ink annotation framework that helps the system to increase the learnability of annotation systems by detecting recognizable intentions from natural annotation behavior on paper-based documents. Our framework recognizes "Targeting Content" and "Commenting," which are related to extraction of annotation information. We have developed a prototype annotation system using our proposed framework and conducted a user study to identify future direction.},

 abstract = {A significant amount of research on digital tables has traditionally investigated the use of hands and fingers to control 2D and 3D artifacts, has even investigated people's expectations when interacting with these devices. However, people often use their hands and body to communicate and express ideas to others. In this work, we explore narrative gestures on a digital table for the purpose of telling stories. We present the results of an observational study of people illustrating stories on a digital table with virtual figurines, and in both a physical sandbox and water with physical figurines. Our results show that the narrative gestures people use to tell stories with objects are highly varied and, in some cases, fundamentally different from the gestures designers and researchers have suggested for controlling digital con-tent. In contrast to smooth, predetermined drags for movement and rotation, people use jiggling, repeated lifting, and bimanual actions to express rich, simultaneous, and independent actions by multiple characters in a story. Based on these results, we suggest that future storytelling designs consider the importance of touch actions for narra-tion, in-place manipulations, the (possibly non-linear) path of a drag, allowing expression through manipulations, and two-handed simultaneous manipulation of multiple objects.},

The floor projection hardware is used for true to scale assembly station layout visualizations. The advantages and drawbacks of a low-cost, true to scale visualization will be discussed. A preliminary evaluation of the proposed system during a production planning workshop has shown that the low-cost implementation is suitable for reaching the production planning goals. Additionally true to scale visualizations support users to estimate distances, speeds and spatial relationships within the digital layout. In future work, motion capture and tracking systems will be integrated and registered to the augmented floor surface area, the projection area will be extended and efficiency improvements will be showed up.},

When a user tries to hold a virtual object, fingers do not stop on the surface of the object and thrust into the object since virtual objects cannot give reaction force. We therefore try to prevent fingers from thrusting into a virtual object by letting the object deform or glide through the fingers. A virtual object is deformed by using a spring-based model and solving the equation of equilibrium. Whether the object glides through the fingers or not is determined by calculating resultant force added to the object and resultant force of static friction when the fingers touch the object. Based on these methods, we constructed a 3D tabletop interface that enables interaction with virtual objects with a greater sense of reality.},

Even though automation can help manage complex tasks and rapidly update information, it may create confusion that negatively impacts operators' situation awareness, and result in sub-optimal decisions. To improve situation awareness in co-located environments on digital tabletop computers, we developed an interactive event timeline that enables exploration of historical system events, using a collaborative digital board game as a case study. We conducted a user study to examine two factors, placement of timelines for multiple users and location of awareness feedback, to understand their impact on situation awareness. The study revealed that interaction with the timeline was correlated with improved situation awareness, and that displaying feedback both on the game board and timeline was the most preferred.},

The combination with an arm-mounted, interactive display allows complex personalized interactions. In contrast to hand-held devices, both hands remain free for interacting with the wall. We discuss different levels of coupling between wearable and wall and propose novel user interface techniques that support user-specific interfaces, data transfer, and arbitrary personal views. In an iterative development process, we built a mock-up using a bendable e-Ink display and a fully functional prototype based on an arm-mounted smartphone. In addition, we developed several applications that showcase the techniques presented. An observational study we conducted demonstrates the high potential of our concepts.},

The motivation is to enable convincing interactive projection mapping on tangibles on the table, which requires a high precision tracking of the location of tangibles. We propose a new fiducial design optimized for GPU based tracking, a technique for calibrating light that allows for computation on a greyscale image rather than a binarized black and white image, an automated technique for compensating for optical distortions in the camera lenses, and a tracking algorithm implemented primarily in shaders on the GPU. The techniques are realized in the BullsEye computer vision software. We demonstrate experimentally that BullsEye provides sub-pixel accuracy down to a tenth of a pixel, which is a significant improvement compared to the commonly used reacTIVision software.},

 abstract = {Querying geographical data on map applications running on touch devices is mainly performed by typing queries using virtual keyboards. Some of those devices are additionally equipped with styli to facilitate freehand sketching and an-notating. As shown by prior work, such hand-drawn sketches can also be used for intuitive and effective spatial querying of geographical data. Building on that groundwork, we present a set of pen-based techniques to selectively convert map annotations into spatial queries with implicitly or explicitly specified scopes. We show how those techniques can be used for trip-planning tasks involving route-finding and searching of points of interest. In a controlled user study comparing the usability and efficiency of the techniques for different querying patterns, we establish participants' general preference for explicit input scopes and obtain indications that, provided handwriting is correctly recognised, input times are comparable to that of a standard (soft) keyboard-based interface. Based on those results and participant feedback, we propose a number of enhancements and extensions to inform the design of future pen-based map applications.},

 abstract = {Welcome to the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces (ITS 2013) in St Andrews, Scotland. This year ITS received a total of 121 valid submissions including 86 papers and 35 notes; this represents an increase of 16% over last year. Of these submissions, 27 papers and 8 notes were accepted, resulting in an overall acceptance rate of 29%--close to last year's, but with an increase in the number of accepted submissions (5 more than last year, or a 17% increase). The number and quality of this year's submissions cement ITS's reputation as the leading venue for work on interactive surfaces and highlight the increasing relevance of this area within Human-Computer Interaction. In response to feedback from the community, this is the first time that the conference has included application papers as a distinct type of paper or note. The response has been outstanding. We received an abundance of high quality application paper submissions from industry and academia that bridge research and practice and provide valuable insights from real-world deployments. Application papers accepted this year are part of the regular program and are distinguishable by an indication on the first page. The peer review process for both application and academic papers was rigorous: all papers received at least two reviews by external experts and one review by a member of the committee. A large number of papers received also additional reviews, meta-reviews, and full reviews by a second member of the committee. The application paper review process differed from the academic review process in two respects. First, application reviews were guided by a set of five questions that brought attention to the domain of the application, the design process, the integration of multiple existing technologies, and practical issues derived from the implementation and deployment of surfaces in a real-world context. Second, application papers received more reviews from members of the ITS community outside of academia.},

@proceedings{Dachselt:2014:2669485,
 abstract = {We are very happy to welcome you to the ninth ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces, held November 16-19, 2014 in Dresden, Germany. Since its inauguration as the Tabletop Workshop in 2006, the conference series has been devoted to an exploration of new approaches for the design, development and use of emerging tabletop and interactive surface technologies. The nine years over which the conference has been held have seen a tremendous evolution in technologies supporting surface-based interaction, leading this year's program to include a range of novel topics around the use of both horizontal and vertical surfaces, mobile surfaces in various sizes, mixed-surface interaction, and embodied interaction around the many displays that surround us. The city of Dresden, also described as 'Florence on the river Elbe', serves as an appropriate location for the study of interactive surfaces. Dresden is a historic city of culture and beautiful architecture, hosting stunning art treasures and one of the world's finest symphony orchestras. This cultural and musical heritage represents the tradition of interacting with our world around us, while at the same time Dresden is a thriving modern city on the forefront of technological advances. It is the home of Europe's largest micro-electronics cluster, of the Technische Universität Dresden as one of Germany's elite universities and a city densely populated by numerous research institutions in key areas such as information and communication technology, new-generation materials and biotechnology. Therefore, held in a city of science and culture, ITS 2014 will focus on the culture of interaction, thereby reflecting that interactive surfaces have become part of our everyday life and culture. Since its earliest days ITS has involved partnership between industry and academia, and this is as true as ever in 2014, which features a strong selection of papers devoted both to pure research and to concrete application of surface technologies. This year, the conference received 112 paper and note submissions from all over the world, of which 31 were selected, for an acceptance rate of 27.7%. The peer-review process was rigorous, with a remarkable team of 35 research and industry leaders ensuring that each submission was reviewed fairly and by the most appropriate reviewers. Papers submitted to ITS received this year a total of 435 reviews and meta-reviews. Acting on the community's feedback, we have kept the "review and resubmit" system for those papers which offered excellent contributions but needed some further work and feedback to get to the high quality and originality level expected of ITS work. The application review process has also matured; this process allows contributions that have a practical relevance for practitioners and have been explored in real settings to be fully represented. A traditional highlight of ITS is its demonstration session, held on the first night of the main conference. The demo session serves to showcase novel technologies, an enormous range of inspiring ideas of the use of interactive surfaces, and provides lively opportunity for exchange of ideas, techniques and experience. This year's session includes 14 demonstrations from academic presenters plus several industrial exhibits. In addition, the ITS poster session will allow early access to work in progress, with 23 posters presented. Six students are presenting their work in the Doctoral Symposium. We are especially grateful to Sheelagh Carpendale, James D. Hollan and Andy Wilson, who will give invaluable advice to the students in the panel of experts. A collection of studios, tutorials and workshops allow focused work on cutting-edge topics such as personal fabrication, collaboration or tactile interaction prior to the main conference. We welcome two distinguished keynotes. The opening plenary will be presented by Professor Jun Rekimoto of the University of Tokyo and Sony Computer Science Laboratories, on "A New You: From Augmented Reality to the Augmented Human". The closing keynote will be delivered by Professor Joachim Sauter of the University of the Arts in Berlin and co-founder of ART+COM, on "Sensitive Skins in Media Art and Design". We are highly grateful to our sponsor ACM SIGCHI and the corporate supporters, without whom the conference would not have been possible. The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) provided a highly-generous platinum level of sponsorship. Our lead industrial partners are Multitouch at the Gold level, SMART Technologies and WACOM at the Silver level, Microsoft and SurfNet at the Bronze level, and GRAND Network of Centres of Excellence as a Friend of ITS.},

We conducted two user studies with 14 and 24 participants respectively and report: (1) force profile graphs that depict the force variations of common touch gestures, (2) the effect of the different conditions on force exerted and gesture completion time, (3) the most common forces that users apply, and the time taken to complete the gestures.

 abstract = {Traditionally, the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) was primarily concerned with designing and investigating interfaces between humans and machines. The primary concern of Surface Computing is also still about designing better interfaces to information. However, with recent technological advances, the concept of "enhancing", "augmenting" or even "re-designing" humans themselves is becoming a very feasible and serious topic of scientific research as well as engineering development. "Augmented Human" is a term that I use to refer to this overall research direction. Augmented Human introduces a fundamental paradigm shift in HCI: from human-computer-interaction to human-computer-integration. In this talk, I will discuss rich possibilities and distinct challenges in enhancing human abilities. I will introduce recent projects conducted by our group including design and applications of wearable eye sensing for augmenting our perception and memory abilities, design of flying cameras as our external eyes, a home appliance that can increase your happiness, an organic physical wall/window that dynamically mediates the environment, and an immersive human-human communication called "JackIn".},

 abstract = {This study designed and developed a novel tactile display that provides a multi-push sensation by using a 6-axis motion platform. The display mechanically controls the position and orientation of a surface panel. A user touching an on-screen button with one finger can push the button vertically. When the user subsequently touches the display with a second finger, the surface panel declines and the position of the first finger remains unchanged. Thus, the user can push at two positions on the surface panel. We also developed a prototype system with six servomotors and a touch panel based on the principle of frustrated total internal reflection.},

The planning typically occurs in an emergency operations centre (EOC) and involves personnel both in the room and also in the field. The EOC provides an interesting context for examining the use of tablets, tabletops and high resolution wall displays, and their role in facilitating information and communication exchange in an emergency response planning scenario. In collaboration with a military and emergency response simulation software company in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, we developed ePlan Multi-Surface, a multi-surface environment for communication and collaboration for emergency response planning exercises.

 abstract = {Learning to play the piano is a prolonged challenge for novices. It requires them to learn sheet music notation and its mapping to respective piano keys, together with articulation details. Smooth playing further requires correct finger postures. The result is a slow learning progress, often causing frustration and strain. To overcome these issues, we propose P.I.A.N.O., a piano learning system with interactive projection that facilitates a fast learning process. Note information in form of an enhanced piano roll notation is directly projected onto the instrument and allows mapping of notes to piano keys without prior sight-reading skills. Three learning modes support the natural learning process with live feedback and performance evaluation. We report the results of two user studies, which show that P.I.A.N.O. supports faster learning, requires significantly less cognitive load, provides better user experience, and increases perceived musical quality compared to sheet music notation and non-projected piano roll notation.},

@proceedings{Nunes:2015:2817721,
 abstract = {We are pleased to welcome you to the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces (ITS) 2015, held from 15-18 November 2015 in Funchal on the wonderful island of Madeira in Portugal, and organized with the support of the Madeira Interactive Technologies Institute (M-ITI). The island of Madeira is an autonomous region of Portugal located 310 miles from the African coast and 620 miles from continental Europe. Madeira is one of Europe's most longstanding holiday island destinations. Historical figures from Sisi (Empress Elisabeth of Austria) to Winston Churchill have enjoyed its mild climate. ACM ITS takes place in Portugal for the first time and is hosted by M-ITI, a research and innovation institute of the University of Madeira. M-ITI was established as an independent non-profit R&D organization founded by the University of Madeira, the Regional Government and Carnegie Mellon University. The institute operates in the interdisciplinary field of human-computer interaction and its vision is to become a world leading center of excellence in design for global change. ITS 2015 marks the 10th anniversary of this series of annual research workshops and conferences that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia. Over the last ten years, the field of interactive tabletops and surfaces has seen significant change with low-cost touch-enabled surfaces in a wide range of form factors and sizes, that are now available off-the-shelf. Ideas from the community have gone from research prototypes to global consumer products and can be found in a wide variety of private and public spaces from museums, offices, schools and airports to hotels, medical centers and homes. To celebrate this, we are introducing a "10-year impact" award this year to recognise the research that was presented at the inaugural meeting of our community and has shown to be the most influential. Sponsored by ACM SIGCHI and generously supported by SMART and Microsoft, the ACM Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces brings together researchers and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds and interest areas. The intimate size of this single-track symposium provides an ideal venue for leading researchers, practitioners, and students to share research results and experiences. As ever, our main goal has been to provide an engaging and high quality program. We have retained the successful format of previous years: a three-day conference event preceded by one day of workshops, tutorials and a doctoral symposium. This year we were delighted to receive 122 paper and note submissions of which we accepted 18 papers and 11 notes (resulting in a highly competitive overall acceptance rate of 24%). Submissions were assessed over the summer by a committee of program committee members, their reviewers, and finally at a remote PC meeting. The topics of this year's papers, notes, posters, and demos reflect the diversity of ideas and perspectives that comprise the ITS community, ranging from wall-sized surfaces to shape changing displays, from pen-and-paper to free-space interaction, and from education to projection systems for bike riding. What brings this all together is a commitment to innovation that expands our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications. The Doctoral Symposium (DS) accepted 7 doctoral students to present and discuss their research with both peers and a panel of experienced ITS researchers. The conference also includes an interactive hands-on reception that presents a juried selection of 26 posters and 12 demos. Finally, we have accepted 7 workshops that bring together researchers and practitioners in a focused setting to advance the state-of-the-art in specific areas related to interactive surfaces. We are especially pleased to have two exciting keynote speakers this year. Charles Spence, head of the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at the University of Oxford, will open the conference with his talk "In Touch with the Future". Charles is interested in how we perceive the world around us, in particular how our brains manage to process the information from each of our difficult senses (such as smell, taste, sight. hearing, and touch) to form the extraordinarily rich multisensory experences that fill our daily lives. His research focuses on how a better understanding of the human mind will lead to the better design of multisensory foods, products, interfaces, and environments in the future. The conference will close with Jinha Lee's talk on "From Surface to Space". Jinha is a designer and engineer working at the boundary of the physical and digital world. He is exploring ways to weave digital information into physical space and material. Lee is currently on leave from his Ph.D. studies at MIT Media Lab directing the Interaction Group at Samsung Electronics. Jinha was named on MIT Technology Review's list of 35 young innovators and Fast Company's list of 32 greatest living designers.},

 abstract = {Improvements in Body Area Network (BAN) technical feasibility have encouraged research, which propose applications exploring data transferring touch interaction. In this work, we aim to provide tactile feedback for these applications to improve user experience. We propose Corona, a wearable tactile feedback device that uses electrostatic force to provide physical stimuli when a user touches objects that are electrically grounded, or of opposite polarity. Unlike previous approach, we neither physically actuate objects nor use any hand-worn tactile feedback devices. We introduce a mechanism to artificially build up electrostatic charge within the human body, and further leverage effects of electrostatic discharge to create novel physical stimuli. In this paper, we report underlying theory of operation as well as details of our prototype implementation. We illustrate our results using two applications: a) SandStorm: visualization of actuated force field using sand, and b) CheckMate: future vision of a touch-based transaction checkout system equipped with Corona to provide haptic sensation for more reassuring feedbacks.},

We have developed an understanding of the deployment environment and every-day noticeboard practices using an ethnographic study which guided system design. Users can write messages or sketch drawings on their NetBoard, as well as post images and other web-based media. NetBoards can be accessed over the internet, allowing remote viewing and modification.

 abstract = {After the spread of personal computers in the mid 1980ies, media art and design focussed primarily on the screen as an interface for nearly two decades. In order to overcome the limitation of the screen as a small rectangular, flat, single-user device, ART+COM developed touch-sensitive surfaces applicable to objects of almost any size and form in the early years of the new century. When encountering these new interfaces in exhibitions and in the museum, the audience accepted them emphatically. Instead of being faced with some wall projection with a classic single-user input interface as usual, visitors were enabled to explore content together and interact with each other. The first touch-sensitive tables Behind The Lines (2003) and floating.numbers (2004) for the Jewish Museum in Berlin turned users into interactive participants who could jointly explore the data surface and discuss what they had discovered. The installations' implicit form of a table encouraged users to interact with each other - after all, tables have served as places of communication and exchange throughout human history. Driven by the success of this multi-user, face-to-face experience ART+COM developed dozens of content and context specific installations ranging from large, rectangular tables to amorphous touch-sensitive sculptures. The talk will discuss the history of installations and spaces using dynamic sensitive surfaces including sensitive tables, sculptures, floors, costumes and architecture and spanning from ART+COMs pre- to post-sensitive-surface era.},

This is particularly the case of the double tap and long pressed gestures, which have some issues related to spurious entry events and time-constrained interactions, respectively. In this paper, we empirically test specific strategies to deal with these issues by evaluating off-the-shelf implementations of these gestures against alternative implementations that follow these guidelines. The study shows that the implementation of these design guidelines has a positive effect on success rates of these two gestures, being feasible their inclusion in future multi-touch applications targeted at pre-kindergarten children.},

However, recent technologies such as 3D printers allow to autonomously print individual tactile maps which can be linked with interactive applications. Besides geographical depictions, textual annotation of maps is crucial. However, this often adds much complexity to tactile maps. To limit tactile complexity, interactive approaches may help to complement maps by the auditive modality. The presented approach integrates barcodes into tactile maps to allow their detection by standard smartphones' cameras. Automatically, more detailed map data is obtained to auditively support the exploration of the tactile map. Our experimental implementation shows the principal feasibility and provides the basis of ongoing comprehensive user studies.},

Unlike static viewports, where the information space is moved (e.g. by panning), dynamic viewports -- so-called dynamic peepholes -- allow the user to move the viewport in physical space and thereby enable egocentric navigation in digital information spaces. In my research I investigate how information spaces and the navigation with peepholes need to be designed in order to exploit spatial memory and navigation performance. In particular I focus on the interplay between the physical and the digital aspects and how they affect user performance. For study purposes I use a tablet as a dynamic peephole.

Current multi-surface implementations of P&D provide little to no feedback during transfer, causing confusion for the person performing the action as well as others in the environment. To address this issue, we investigated the use of virtual embodiments to improve awareness of transferred objects, in the context of a real-world group task that relied heavily on cross-device transfer. An iterative design process led to the design of Surface Ghosts virtual embodiments, which take the form of semi-transparent 'ghosts' of the transferred objects displayed under the "owner's" hand on the tabletop during transfer. A user study that compared two Surface Ghosts designs-varied by how explicitly the "owner" was indicated-showed that both designs improved awareness of transferred objects when compared to a no-feedback control condition, especially for tabletop-to-tablet transfers.},

Second, we developed custom experiment software for recording and analysing multimodal interactions using Kinect. Third, we conducted a study based on Morris's design. However, after first using Wizard of Oz, Kinect Browser was used in a second elicitation task, allowing us to analyse and compare the differences between the two methods.Our study demonstrates the effects of using mixed-initiative elicitation with significant differences to user-driven elicitation without system dialogue.

Both target groups are involved in the development process; different studies are conducted to ensure the therapeutic adequateness and the system's usability. The latter is especially important for therapists as they are responsible for navigating through the modules and configuring them for the patients individually. This paper describes two fun.tast.tisch. modules that have been evaluated regarding usability for therapists in a longer-term study in summer 2013 in a rehabilitation hospital, and presents the study's results.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces a system to assign and visualize tasks of projects for tabletop computers and smartphone devices. In general, task assignment is a highly collaborative process and requires intensive discussions among project participants. Therefore, face-to-face communication is recommended for this process because it promises better results than network-based communication. It is faster in reaching a consensus, richer in terms of quality of communication and tends to be more satisfying for the group (compared to computer-mediated communication). The use of a tabletop system promises to deliver benefits of both worlds: the productivity and availability of computer-mediated systems and the social benefits of face-to-face communication. To this end, we introduce MultiTask, a digital tool to plan projects and assign related tasks. MultiTask consists of two components: a tabletop application for table discussions and an Android companion application with limited interaction possibilities in order to provide better availability while on the move. An explorative evaluation involving qualitative methodologies was conducted in order to improve the system and identify participants' preferences regarding this approach.},

However, creating 3D user interfaces (3D UIs) is a difficult endeavor, especially in fully immersive virtual environments (IVEs), such as head-mounted displays, because problems like distance underestimation and the lack of haptic feedback complicate the design and require new innovative solutions. Our research aims to identify the problems during the design of 3D UIs and the interaction with virtual objects in 3D space, and find ways to solve or avoid those problems, both for fully immersive environments and stereoscopic multi-touch displays. Furthermore, we aim to investigate new ways to utilize 3D UIs and improve on the available input devices.},

This enables a new breed of spatially-aware multi-user and multi-device applications for around-the-table collaboration without an interactive tabletop. At any time, users can add or remove displays and reconfigure them in space in an ad-hoc manner without the need of installing any software or attaching markers. Additionally, hands are tracked to detect interactions above and between displays, enabling fluent cross-device interactions. We contribute a novel hybrid sensing approach that uses RGB and depth data to increase tracking quality and a technical evaluation of its capabilities and limitations. For enabling installation-free ad-hoc collaboration, we also introduce a web-based architecture and JavaScript API for future HuddleLamp applications. Finally, we demonstrate the resulting design space using five examples of cross-device interaction techniques.},

However, there is a tension between the efficiency given by simultaneous manipulation and the need to coordinate and reflect in group activity. We implemented a central point of control to synchronize the group work and afford opportunities for equal participation in a tabletop application. In this study, we analyzed log and video data of seven groups of primary school students using a tabletop application. The results show that log data about this central control's position and rotation can be a predictor of equal participation, also helping interpret group performance. Finally, we discuss the implications of such findings, e.g., to provide teachers with useful information about group collaborative processes.},

However, unlike other recent interactive technologies such as smartphones, they have not yet found their way into people's everyday lives. Possible reasons include high cost as well as a lack of suitable applications. In this paper, we present our prototypical implementation of a low-cost, unobtrusive interactive surface, integrated with the dining table in a real-world living room. To motivate our approach, we explore three scenarios highlighting potential applications for our system and present their prototypical implementations. In the first scenario, we extend regular board games with interactive components without sacrificing their unique haptic experience. In the second scenario, we investigate ambient notifications which provide a method for delivering information to the users subconsciously. Finally, we explore the concept of augmented dining in which the appearance of food placed on the table is augmented or modified by the system.},

With this system, virtual objects are stereoscopically-presented, and the objects respond to the finger movement that is obtained using the stereo camera. We conducted an experiment to evaluate visual and haptic synchronization and the result showed that visual and haptic feedback was the most synchronized with latencies around 150 ms, while finger and button movements were more synchronized with smaller latencies. We also conducted a comparison experiment to explore which synchronization is more important and the result showed that the visual synchronization of finger and button movements is more important than visual and haptic synchronization.},
