Our system does not only convey global confirmative feedback on user input but allows the UI designer to enrich the entire interface with a tactile layer conveying local semantic information.

The two main design goals for the digital version are supporting externalization of thinking and higher-level thinking skills. The evaluation of the final version provided evidence that use of the application increases the probability that effective learning mechanisms will occur and encourages higher-level thinking through reflection.

From portable hand held devices like smart phones to tabletops, large displays and even devices that project on arbitrary surfaces support touch interface. However, at the end, it is the applications that bring meaning for these technologies to people. Incorporating a touch interface in application requires translating meaningful touches into system recognizable events. This process often involves complex implementations that are sometimes hard to fine tune. Due to the lack of higher-level frameworks, developers often end up writing code from scratch to implement touch interactions in their application. To address this, we present a domain-specific language to define multi-touch interaction that hides the low level implementation complexities from application developers. This allows them to focus on designing touch interactions that are natural and meaningful to the application context without worrying about implementation complexities.},

 abstract = {Horizontal displays are emerging as a standard platform for engaging participants in collaborative tasks. Little is known about how groups of people view visualizations in these collaborative settings. Several techniques have been proposed to assist, such as duplicating or reorienting the visual displays. However, when visualizations compete for pixels on the display, prior solutions do not work effectively. We first ran an experiment to identify whether orientation on horizontal displays impacts the legibility of simple visualizations such as charts. The results reveal that users are best at reading a chart when it is the right side up, taking them 20% less time to read than when it is upside down. This insight led us to develop the Orientation Agnostic Graph (OA-Graph), making use of a radial layout designed to be legible regardless of orientation. In a second experiment we found that users can read OA-Graphs better than when the graphs are upside down but less well than traditional graphs in the right side up. The design of our novel visualization, informed by radial visualization methods will assist designers in developing charts that are not easily affected by user orientation, an issue that is prevalent in collaborative table-top systems. Certain tasks such as observing relative differences can benefit from OA-Graphs.},

Furthermore, it focuses on how users compensate for conflicts between non-interactivity and interactivity created by unintended touch interaction when using a multi-touch enabled tabletop.

We observed whether and how they used gestures to do so on a touch sensitive Microsoft Surface tabletop and on a sheet of paper. Our results suggest that touching is an essential part of such an activity and that the compensation strategies people adapt to avoid conflicts may reduce precision of communication and increase the physical strain on the user.},

Tangible views facilitate making multiple - previously virtual - views physically "graspable". In addition, by tracking the 3D movement of tangible views, we can control various visualization parameters with more degrees of freedom. In the second demo, we showcase tangible user interface palettes (TUIP) by means of a simple graphics editor application written for a pen-supported tabletop environment. TUIPs provide a novel way of making traditional graphical user interfaces (GUI) tangible and thus more flexible. We demonstrate how users can arrange GUI palettes more easily by physically moving them on or above the table surface. Hereby, image content is dynamically projected onto paper-like mobile displays. Users can adjust palette sizes by physically un-folding them. We also show how the height above the tabletop can be used for interaction, e.g., for browsing file content and navigating through image details.},

 abstract = {In all but the purest appliance interfaces, users need some of the fundamental core facilities for general computing interface elements: to change applications; change the files the application uses; and control which interface elements are present on the table. While these facilities have been refined for desktops, the particular affordances and limitations of tabletops call for a rethink of the interfaces for these actions. We describe the design process for Switch, which supports the core functions of application and configuration switching at an interactive tabletop. We began with several low-fidelity prototypes, evaluating these to a refined set of four. We then evaluated each of these using Heuristic Evaluation with 4 experts and Cognitive Walkthrough by 5 experts. From this, we created the final Switch design which we evaluated for usability with a think-aloud study by 8 users. We conclude that Switch is easy to learn and use for the core facilities for general computing. We reflect on lessons learnt and directions for the future. Our key contributions are the exploration of user interface support for a set of the most fundamental core facilities for general computing at tabletops, our use of these to design the Switch tool and our usability evaluation of Switch, providing a foundation for the design of the core user interface elements that will enable people to make flexible use of tabletops.},

 abstract = {In information visualization, interaction is commonly carried out by using traditional input devices, and visual feedback is usually given on desktop displays. By contrast, recent advances in interactive surface technology suggest combining interaction and display functionality in a single device for a more direct interaction. With our work, we contribute to the seamless integration of interaction and display devices and introduce new ways of visualizing and directly interacting with information. Rather than restricting the interaction to the display surface alone, we explicitly use the physical three-dimensional space above it for natural interaction with multiple displays. For this purpose, we introduce tangible views as spatially aware lightweight displays that can be interacted with by moving them through the physical space on or above a tabletop display's surface. Tracking the 3D movement of tangible views allows us to control various parameters of a visualization with more degrees of freedom. Tangible views also facilitate making multiple -- previously virtual -- views physically "graspable". In this paper, we introduce a number of interaction and visualization patterns for tangible views that constitute the vocabulary for performing a variety of common visualization tasks. Several implemented case studies demonstrate the usefulness of tangible views for widely used information visualization approaches and suggest the high potential of this novel approach to support interaction with complex visualizations.},

What is surprising is how little proxemics are used to mediate people's interactions with surrounding digital devices. We imagine proxemic interaction as devices with fine-grained knowledge of nearby people and other devices -- their position, identity, movement, and orientation -- and how such knowledge can be exploited to design interaction techniques. In particular, we show how proxemics can: regulate implicit and explicit interaction; trigger such interactions by continuous movement or by movement of people and devices in and out of discrete proxemic regions; mediate simultaneous interaction of multiple people; and interpret and exploit people's directed attention to other people and objects. We illustrate these concepts through an interactive media player running on a vertical surface that reacts to the approach, identity, movement and orientation of people and their personal devices.},

Motivated by findings from this study, we propose refactoring the working environment of our target audience to improve the integration of digital material into established paper-centric processes. This is largely facilitated through the use of hybrid documents, i.e., cross-modal compound documents that employ a printed book for rich, tangible interaction in tandem with a digital component for matching interactive augmentation on a digital workbench. The results from two user studies in which we evaluated increasingly detailed prototypes demonstrate that this design offers better support for central workflows in literary studies than currently prevalent approaches.},

Analysis and creation of node-link diagrams is an important activity, and one that can benefit greatly from the enhanced interaction bandwidth and collaborative affordances of interactive tabletops. The applications that we will demonstrate implement a broad set of novel interaction techniques for editing and manipulating node-link diagrams. Some techniques have been implemented with hybrid input (pens + touch). They allow flexible creation and manipulation of diagram elements by sketching and structural editing. This includes connecting and copying nodes by bimanual input and changing types of edges by gestures. Other techniques are meant to support users in analyzing diagrams. For example, by strumming or bundling edges, it is easy to see what nodes are connected by the edges.},

The display edges opposite the cameras are illuminated and fingers are detected since they block the light in the camera images. The approach is scalable and can be used in a wide variety of displays. Due to self-occlusion of the touchpoints, it is challenging to relate camera measurements to tracked points. In this paper, we present our approach for tracking and managing multiple touchpoints in such camera set-ups. We describe the mathematical background for modeling and calibrating the cameras, the design of the extended Kalman filter for point tracking, and the logic for adding, updating and removing the touchpoints.

 abstract = {We present luminos, tangible building blocks that allow users to assemble physical 3D structures on a tabletop computer. All luminos are tracked using the table's built-in camera, including those luminos located on top of other luminos. To enable this, each lumino contains a glass fiber bundle that allows the camera to "see through it". Luminos thereby extend the concept of fiducial markers commonly used with tabletop computers to the third dimension. Yet they preserve many of the benefits of regular tabletop markers: luminos are unpowered, self-contained objects that require no calibration, making it easy to maintain a large number of them. The Construction Kit demo allows attendees to slip into the role of a (very simple) architect, while the table takes on the role of a "civil engineer". Attendees can try out different 3D constructions; at the same time, the table tracks what is being constructed. This allows the table to critique constructions, displays piece lists and running totals of construction cost. To round things up, we will bring prototyping materials, such as plastic fibers, aluminum blocks, and tools, so that ITS attendees can get a sense of how to make their own luminos.},

ITS 2009 is the 4th event in a series of annual research workshops that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia as "Tabletop", and has subsequently traveled around the world (Tabletop 2007 in Newport, RI, USA; Tabletop and Interactive Surfaces (TIS) 2008 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and has also broadened in scope beyond its original focus on horizontal computer systems. Based on the overwhelming success of the previous workshops, ITS 2009 has moved to a conference status under the sponsorship of the Academic Computing Machinery (ACM) professional association, and will now have its proceedings archived in the ACM digital library. ITS is a premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of new and emerging tabletop and interactive surface technologies. As a new community, we embrace the growth of the discipline in a wide variety of areas, including innovations in ITS hardware, software, interaction design, and studies expanding our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications in modern society. We believe this year's technical program reflects this broad scope. In these proceedings you will find contributions from both academia and industry from across the world, including 22 full papers and 7 notes. This year's program reflects both continued innovation of interactive surface technologies and a maturation of the technology toward support real-world individual and collaborative activities. The program features topics that expand the limits of current interactive surface capabilities, including exciting new hardware platforms that enable more sophisticated and nuanced user input, innovative interaction techniques that enable more complex interaction with application data and functionality, and use case examples of interactive tabletop and surface applications developed to support different usage scenarios.},

 abstract = {Sensing the depth (distance from the surface) of fingers/hands near a tabletop is very important. It allows us to use three-dimensional (3D) gesture interaction in multi-touch applications as we do in the real world. We introduce Z-touch, a multi-touch table that can sense the approximate postures of fingers or hands in the proximity of the tabletop's surface. Z-touch uses a vision-based posture sensing system. Multilayered infrared (IR) laser planes are synchronized with shutter signals from a high-speed camera, which captures each layer of the laser images. A depth map is obtained by using the captured image. Our prototype works at ~30 fps. Z-touch not only uses with the finger/hand contact points but also the angle of the hovering fingers. The interaction with the finger angles is unique and allows users to control multiple parameters by using a single finger. In this study, we introduce the principle of the method of finger detection and its applications (e.g., drawing, map zooming viewer, Bezier curve control).},

ITS 2010 is the 5th event in a series of annual research workshops and conferences that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia as "Tabletop", and has subsequently traveled around the world (Tabletop 2007 in Newport, RI, USA; Tabletop and Interactive Surfaces (TIS) 2008 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the ACM International Conference ITS 2009 in Banff, Canada). In addition, ITS has also broadened in scope beyond its original focus on horizontal computer systems and ITS 2010 is a premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of new and emerging tabletop and interactive surface technologies. As a still young and very active community, we embrace the growth of the discipline in a wide variety of areas, including innovations in ITS hardware, software, interaction design, and studies expanding our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications in modern society. ITS 2010 will bring together top researchers and practitioners who are interested in both the technical and human aspects of interactive tabletop and surface technologies. In 2010, we have extended the conference format and added a separate day for a doctoral symposium and a larger slate of tutorials before the main conference. In addition, we established a mentor program to help those with less experience in academic publication to prepare competitive publications. Additionally, the review process was formalized, with a smaller program committee each responsible for seeking external reviews for a larger number of submissions. With this change, we intend to continue ITS growth as a premiere venue in the field. We believe this year's technical program reflects a broad scope. In these proceedings you will find contributions from both academia and industry from around the world, including 19 full papers and 13 notes (acceptance rate of 28 %). This year's program reflects both continued innovation of interactive surface technologies and a maturation of the field as it expands to include real-world individual and collaborative activities. The program contains topics that expand the limits of current interactive surface capabilities, including exciting new hardware platforms that enable more sophisticated and nuanced user input, innovative interaction techniques that enable more complex interaction with application data and functionality, and use case examples of interactive tabletop and surface applications developed to support different usage scenarios.},

This informal learning experience is based on a vertical, rear-projected screen of 2x1.5m (6.56x4.92 feet) and an IR reflection multi-touch system. The application shows simplified visuals of a cancer tumor at one end of a blood vessel. At the opposite end of the blood vessel there are ingredients to cure the tumor. Through gestures, users create a dose with one of the possible combinations of those ingredients and drag it through the blood vessel to the tumor. While dragging each dose, users can observe how it affects the body and the tumor. These observations provide clues on which ingredients should be part of the dose in order to eliminate the tumor completely. In this context, the main learning goal of the experience is achieved when users discover that such dose includes a gold nanoparticle. This experience is suited for a museum setting because it activates users while allowing them to learn at their own pace. In addition, it provides a comfortable, non-encumbered learning experience for up to four users, because they can interact with their hands while standing up.},

In this paper, we present a method for establishing a bidirectional communication channel between mobile phones and vision-based interactive surfaces utilizing the built-in flash-light and camera of mobile phones and the screen and camera of vision-based tabletops. We establish an entirely visual, secure and bidirectional communication channel at a speed superior to previous vision-based approaches, enabling users to establish connections and transfer data to and from interactive surfaces using ordinary out-of-the-box hardware.},

 abstract = {In consideration of the rapid development of displays and multi-touch technologies, many workspaces could feature integrated multi-touch displays in the near future and therefore the possibility of using them as input devices for other computers needs to be reviewed. The idea is, to get rid of many different input devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, multi-touch-pad) by using a single multi-touch display. Furthermore the display can be used as an additional monitor to show e.g. toolbars, which can be directly manipulated through multi-touch gestures. In this demo, an adaptive keyboard (different layouts, shortcut icons) and a multi-touch-pad, shown on a large-scale multi-touch device, can be used to control a standard windows laptop. The device works also as a second monitor where direct touch input can be used.},

Intuitive interfaces that allow non-experts to perform character animation with standard input devices would open up many possibilities. Therefore, we propose a novel multitouch interface for simultaneously controlling the many degrees of freedom of a human arm. We combine standard multitouch techniques and a morph map into a bimanual interface, and evaluate this interface in a three-layered user study with repeated interactions. The multitouch interface was found to be as easy to learn as the mouse interface while outperforming it in terms of coordination. For the analysis, we propose a novel quantity-based coordination measure. For the systematic exploration of the design space, we suggest using dataflow diagrams. Our results show that even complex multitouch interfaces can be easy to learn and that our interface allows non-experts to produce highly coordinated arm-hand animations with subtle timing.},

We develop 3 metaphors, button widgets, animated spring widgets, and physical props, as primitives for simple, physically-based puzzles which afford the disclosure of static and dynamic hand gestures. Using these metaphors, we implemented a gesture set representing 14 of 16 gesture types in an established hand gesture taxonomy. We present the results of a quantitative and qualitative evaluation which indicate this approach motivates gesture rehearsal more so than video demonstrations, while memory recall was equivalent overall but improved in the short-term, for controlled tasks.},

 abstract = {Suppose a user is interacting with other persons around a digital tabletop or in front of a digital wall. A user wants to launch a new graphical component or an application in the part of the screen next to him. Traditional methods such as popup menus allow him to first open the application and afterwards let him move, resize and orient the component appropriately. Meanwhile, the component may cover some objects the others users are looking at or interacting with. How to avoid this disruption of other persons' activity? This paper describes menu techniques for adding a new user's interface object on a shared device while preserving mutual awareness of the participants without disturbing them in their interaction. We present Sketched Menu, Abbreviated Sketched Menu and Iconic Gestures. These techniques let a user specify the shape, the size, the location and the orientation of the desired object before its creation. Sketched menus and iconic gestures preserve the mutual awareness. These techniques allow both adaptation of a user to the current context -the actions of the other users and the spatial arrangement of the objects on the tabletop-and the others to be aware of the foreseen action and the related space claim.},

Limits of depth estimate resolution and line of sight requirements dictate that the determination of the moment of touch will not be as precise as that of more direct sensing techniques such as capacitive touch screens. However, using a depth-sensing camera to detect touch has significant advantages: first, the interactive surface need not be instrumented. Secondly, this approach allows touch sensing on non-flat surfaces. Finally, information about the shape of the users and their arms and hands above the surface may be exploited in useful ways, such as determining hover state, or that multiple touches are from same hand or from the same user.
