 abstract = {Smartphones provide large amounts of personal data, functionalities, and apps and make a substantial part of our daily communication. But during phone calls the phone cannot be used much beyond voice communication and does not offer support for synchronous collaboration. This is owed to the fact that first, despite the availability of alternatives, the phone is typically held at one's ear; and second that the small mobile screen is less suited to be used with existing collaboration software. This paper presents a novel in-call collaboration system that leverages projector phones as they provide a large display that can be used while holding the phone to the ear to project an interactive interface anytime and anywhere. The system uses a desktop metaphor user interface and provides a private and a shared space, live mirroring of the shared space and user defined access rights to shared content. We evaluated the system in a comparative user study. The results of the user study highlight the general benefits of synchronous in-call collaboration and in particular the advantages of the projected display and our developed concepts. Our findings inform future designers of synchronous remote collaboration software for interactive surfaces.},

We examine different ways of performing interactions in this multi-device ecology. We conducted a study into the use of a phone as a controller for a dial manipulation task, comparing three different forms of interaction: direct touch, using the phone as a general-purpose tangible controller on a tabletop computer and manipulating the dial directly on the phone's screen. We also examined user performance for these interactions both with and without tactile feedback from the phone. We found interacting on the phone itself fastest overall, with tactile feedback improving performance. We also show a range of concerns that users have about using their phone as a controller. The results suggest that using a phone and table together can sometimes be better than using the table alone.},

@proceedings{Shaer:2012:2396636,
 abstract = {We are pleased to welcome you to the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces (ITS) 2012, held from November 11-14th, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ITS 2012 marks the 7th anniversary of a series of annual research workshops and conferences that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia. In this short amount of time, the field of Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces has rapidly evolved. Hardware prices are falling, core sensing technology is improving, software toolkits are maturing, and interaction paradigms are beginning to solidify. As a result, interactive tabletops and surfaces are increasingly making their way beyond laboratories and appearing in a wide variety of private and public spaces including museums, offices, schools, airports, hotels, medical centers, and homes. Such surfaces employ a variety of technologies including capacitive sensing, computer vision, motion sensors, and appear in a variety of formfactors such as large walls and tabletops, tablets and slates, flexible materials, and on-demand projection. Sponsored by ACM and generously supported by National Science Foundation and industry, the ACM conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces brings together researchers and practitioners from a variety of backgrounds and interest areas. The intimate size of this singletrack symposium provides an ideal venue for leading researchers, practitioners, and students to exchange research results and experiences. This year we received 103 paper and note submissions (63 papers and 40 notes) of which we accepted 24 papers and 6 notes for an overall acceptance rate of 29%. We also introduced a new review process modeled after the 2012 ACM CSCW conference, in which papers and notes underwent two review cycles. After the first review by two external reviewers and one program committee member, submissions received either a "Revise" or "Reject" decision. Authors of papers in the "Revise" pool then participated in a second phase of the submission process, in which they had 31/2 weeks to revise and resubmit their work based on the initial reviews (and also received an additional meta-review from a second program committee member). Revised submissions were then re-reviewed as the basis for final decisions. This is similar to a journal review process, except that it is limited to one revision with a strict deadline. We believe that this process has resulted in an extremely high quality papers and notes program, which we hope that you find enlightening and exciting! In addition to the papers and notes program, the conference hosts several other programs. The Doctoral Symposium (DS) accepted seven doctoral students to discuss their research with peers and with a panel of experienced ITS researchers in an informal setting. The conference also includes an interactive hands-on reception that presents a juried selection of 21 posters and 18 demos. This year, ITS brings the theme of Beyond Flat Displays in our pre-conference venues with a tutorial and a workshop: four tutorials that offer novel practical experiences to conference attendees with diverse skills and backgrounds, and a pre-conference workshop that will challenge attendees to explore the realm Beyond Flat Displays. The National Science Foundation extends generous support for DS attendees and for student travel awards; this support will result in more opportunities for students to engage in this diverse and growing community. The titles of the papers, notes, posters, and demos, reflect the diversity of ideas and perspectives that comprise the ITS community, ranging from large tabletop surfaces to non-flat displays, from pen and paper to free-space interaction, from education to surfaces "in the wild". What brings it all together is a commitment to innovation that expands our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications.},

Although we agree that touch is the main source of information, unless other cues are accounted for, user intention might not be accurately recognized. We propose to expand the expressiveness of touch interfaces by augmenting touch with acoustic sensing. In our vision, users can naturally express different actions by touching the surface with different body parts, such as fingers, knuckles, fingernails, punches, and so forth - not always distinguishable by touch technologies but recognized by acoustic sensing. Our contribution is the integration of touch and sound to expand the input language of surface interaction.},

With Pointable, the dominant hand selects remote targets, while the non-dominant hand can scale and rotate targets with a dynamic C/D gain. We conducted 3 experiments; the first showed that pointing at a distance using Pointable has a Fitts' law throughput comparable to that of a mouse. In the second experiment, we found that Pointable had the same performance as multi-touch input in a resize, rotate and drag task. In a third study, we observed that when given the choice, over 75% of participants preferred to use Pointable over multi-touch for target manipulation. In general, Pointable allows users to manipulate out-of-reach targets, without loss of performance, while minimizing the need to lean, stand up, or involve collocated collaborators.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a method for tracking multiple active tangible devices on tabletops. Most tangible devices for tabletops use infrared to send information about their position, orientation, and state. The method we propose can be realized as a tabletop system using a low-cost camera to detect position and a low-cost infrared (IR) receiver to detect the state of each device. Since two different receivers (camera and IR-receiver) are used simultaneously we call the method dual mode. Using this method, it is possible to use devices with a large variation of states simultaneously on a tabletop, thus having more interactive devices on the surface.},

 abstract = {Extending the tabletop display to the third dimension using a stereoscopic projection offers the possibility to improve applications by using the volume above the table surface. The combination of multi-touch input and stereoscopic projection usually requires an indirect technique to interact with objects above the tabletop, as touches can only be detected on the surface. Triangle Cursor is a 3D interaction technique that allows specification of a 3D position and yaw rotation above the interactive tabletop. It was designed to avoid occlusions that disturb the stereoscopic perception. While Triangle Cursor uses an indirect approach, the position, the height above the surface and the yaw rotation can be controlled simultaneously, resulting in a 4 DOF manipulation technique. We have evaluated Triangle Cursor in an initial user study and compared it to a related existing technique in a formal user study. Our experiments show that users were able to perform all tasks significantly faster with our technique without loosing any precision. Most of the subjects considered the technique easy to use and satisfying.},

We ran an experiment to compare the effects of two different sets of tactile feedback when delivered at two different distal locations on the body (wrist and trouser pocket) using a high quality actuator. The results showed that both sets of feedback improved the text entry rates at the two locations, and that providing more complex feedback produces greater benefits than simplified feedback.

 abstract = {In this paper we present a low cost pressure sensing method for Tangible User Interface (TUI) objects on interactive surfaces, using conventional FTIR and DI tracking. While current TUIs use optical tracking for an object's position and orientation, they rely on mechanical or electric enhancements to enable sensing of other input parameters such as pressure. Our approach uses dedicated marker pads for pressure sensing embedded into an optical marker pattern for position and orientation tracking. Two different marker designs allow different precision levels: Number of Contacts (NoC) allows click sensing and Area of Contact (AoC) enables continuous pressure sensing. We describe the working principles of the marker patterns and the construction of the corresponding tangible objects. We have tested continuous pressure sensing in a preliminary user study and will also discuss limitations of our approach.},

@proceedings{Kruger:2010:1936652,
 abstract = {We are pleased to host the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces (ITS) 2010, held November 7th to the 10th, 2010, in Saarbrücken, Germany. ITS 2010 is the 5th event in a series of annual research workshops and conferences that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia as "Tabletop", and has subsequently traveled around the world (Tabletop 2007 in Newport, RI, USA; Tabletop and Interactive Surfaces (TIS) 2008 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and the ACM International Conference ITS 2009 in Banff, Canada). In addition, ITS has also broadened in scope beyond its original focus on horizontal computer systems and ITS 2010 is a premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of new and emerging tabletop and interactive surface technologies. As a still young and very active community, we embrace the growth of the discipline in a wide variety of areas, including innovations in ITS hardware, software, interaction design, and studies expanding our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications in modern society. ITS 2010 will bring together top researchers and practitioners who are interested in both the technical and human aspects of interactive tabletop and surface technologies. In 2010, we have extended the conference format and added a separate day for a doctoral symposium and a larger slate of tutorials before the main conference. In addition, we established a mentor program to help those with less experience in academic publication to prepare competitive publications. Additionally, the review process was formalized, with a smaller program committee each responsible for seeking external reviews for a larger number of submissions. With this change, we intend to continue ITS growth as a premiere venue in the field. We believe this year's technical program reflects a broad scope. In these proceedings you will find contributions from both academia and industry from around the world, including 19 full papers and 13 notes (acceptance rate of 28 %). This year's program reflects both continued innovation of interactive surface technologies and a maturation of the field as it expands to include real-world individual and collaborative activities. The program contains topics that expand the limits of current interactive surface capabilities, including exciting new hardware platforms that enable more sophisticated and nuanced user input, innovative interaction techniques that enable more complex interaction with application data and functionality, and use case examples of interactive tabletop and surface applications developed to support different usage scenarios.},

Instead of offering 2D information on a rigid window or screen, we place our information on a soft flexible cloth that can be draped, pulled, stretched, and folded with multiple fingers and hands, supporting any number of information views. Combining our multitouch flexible information cloth with simple manipulable objects provides a physically-based information viewing environment that offers similar advantages to complex detail-in-context viewing. Previous detail-in-context views can be re-created by draping cloth over virtual objects in this physics simulation, thereby approximating many of the existing techniques by providing zoomed-in information in the context of zoomed-out information. These detail-in-context views are approximated because, rather than use distortion, the draped cloth naturally drapes and folds showing magnified regions within a physically understandable context. In addition, the information cloth remains flexibly responsive, allowing one to tweak, unfold, and smooth out regions as desired.},

Users hold the mobile device, which has an electro-tactile display attached at the back. When a finger touches the visual cues on the front screen panel, such as a button or an icon, the electro-tactile display at the back transmits the unique tactile sensation associated with this behavior of the cues to the palm of the hand. As a result, we speculate that the user can manipulate visual information with less visual attention, or even potentially in an eyes-free manner.

To achieve this potential, we need to gain understanding of how to design tabletop environments so that they capture relevant information about collaboration processes so that we can make it available in a form that is useful for learners, their teachers and facilitators. This paper draws upon research in computer supported collaborative learning to establish a set of principles for the design of a tabletop learning system. We then show how these have been used to design our Collaid (Collaborative Learning Aid) environment. Key features of this system are: capture of multi-modal data about collaboration in a tabletop activity using a microphone array and a depth sensor; integration of these data with other parts of the learning system; transforming the data into visualisations depicting the processes that occurred during the collaboration at the table; and sequence mining of the interaction logs. The main contributions of this paper are: our design guidelines to build the Collaid environment and the demonstration of its use in a collaborative concept mapping learning tool applying data mining and visualisations of collaboration.},

Therefore, they are in constant pursue of better virtual representations of the reservoir models, improved user awareness of their embedded data, and more intuitive ways to explore them, all ultimately leading to more informed decision making. Tabletops have great potential in providing powerful interactive representation to reservoir engineers, as well as enhancing the flexibility, immediacy and overall capabilities of their analysis, and consequently bringing more confidence into the decision making process. In this paper, we present a collection of 3D reservoir visualization techniques on tabletop interfaces applied to the domain of reservoir engineering, and argue that these provide greater insight into reservoir models. We support our claims with findings from a qualitative user study conducted with 12 reservoir engineers, which brought us insight into our techniques, as well as a discussion on the potential of tabletop-based visualization solutions for the domain of reservoir engineering.},

 abstract = {We present Height-Adjustable Tangibles (HATs) for table-top interaction. HATs are active tangibles with 4 degrees of freedom that are capable of moving, rotating, and changing height. By adding height as an additional dimension for manipulation and representation, HATs offer more freedom to users than ordinary tangibles. HATs support bidirectional interaction, enabling them to reflect changes in the digital model via active visual feedback and to assist users via haptic feedback. A number of scenarios for using HATs are proposed, including interaction with complex and dependent models and applying HATs as tangible indicator widgets. We then introduce the implementation of HAT prototypes, for which we utilize motor-driven potentiometers to realize bidirectional interaction via the height dimension.},

 abstract = {The tabletop computer interface has the potential to support idea generation by a group using the brainstorming technique. This paper describes the design and implementation of a table-top brainstorming system. To gain insights into its effectiveness, we conducted a user study which compared our system against a more conventional approach. We analysed the processes and results with the goal of gaining an understanding of the ways a tabletop brainstorming system can support the phases of this activity. We found that our tabletop interface facilitated the creation of more ideas and participants tended to create more categories. We observed that the tabletop provides a useful record of the group processes and this is valuable for reviewing how well a group followed recommended brainstorming processes. Our contributions are a new table-top brainstorming system and insights into the nature of the benefits a tabletop affords for brainstorming and for capturing the processes employed by a group.},

The system provides a consistent set of multi-touch tools and gestures for aligning and distributing graphical objects on interactive surfaces. NEAT explicitly considers expert requirements and supports a rich and consistent set of layout functions. Amongst others, it minimizes visual distraction by layout tools, combines separate steps of interaction to compound ones and allows effective interaction by combining multi-touch and pen input. Furthermore, Neat provides a set of bimanual gestures for achieving layout tasks in a quick and effective way without explicitly invoking any tools. From initial expert user feedback we derive several principles for layout tools on interactive displays.},

 abstract = {We report on a long-term participatory design process during which we designed and improved RealTimeChess, a collaborative but competitive game that is played using touch input by multiple people on a tabletop display. During the design process we integrated concurrent input from all players and pace control, allowing us to steer the interaction along a continuum between high-paced simultaneous and low-paced turn-based gameplay. In addition, we integrated tutorials for teaching interaction techniques, mechanisms to control territoriality, remote interaction, and alert feedback. Integrating these mechanism during the participatory design process allowed us to examine their effects in detail, revealing for instance effects of the competitive setting on the perception of awareness as well as territoriality. More generally, the resulting application provided us with a testbed to study interaction on shared tabletop surfaces and yielded insights important for other time-critical or attention-demanding applications.},

@inproceedings{Marquardt:2011:DUH:2076354.2076358,
 abstract = {Recent work in multi-touch tabletop interaction introduced many novel techniques that let people manipulate digital content through touch. Yet most only detect touch blobs. This ignores richer interactions that would be possible if we could identify (1) which part of the hand, (2) which side of the hand, and (3) which person is actually touching the surface. Fiduciary-tagged gloves were previously introduced as a simple but reliable technique for providing this information. The problem is that its low-level programming model hinders the way developers could rapidly explore new kinds of user- and handpart-aware interactions. We contribute the TouchID toolkit to solve this problem. It allows rapid prototyping of expressive multi-touch interactions that exploit the aforementioned characteristics of touch input. TouchID provides an easy-to-use event-driven API as well as higher-level tools that facilitate development: a glove configurator to rapidly associate particular glove parts to handparts; and a posture configurator and gesture configurator for registering new hand postures and gestures for the toolkit to recognize. We illustrate TouchID's expressiveness by showing how we developed a suite of techniques that exploits knowledge of which handpart is touching the surface.},

 abstract = {We are pleased to host the ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces (ITS) 2011, held from 13th to 16th of November 2011, in Kobe, Japan. ITS 2011 is the 6th event in a series of annual research workshops and conferences that began in 2006 in Adelaide, Australia as "Table-top", and has subsequently traveled around the world (Tabletop 2007 in Newport, RI, USA; Tabletop and Interactive Surfaces (TIS) 2008 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, the ACM International Conference ITS 2009 in Banff, Canada, and the ACM International Conference ITS 2010 in Saarbrücken, Germany). ITS has also broadened in scope beyond its original focus on horizontal computer systems and it becomes a premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of new and emerging tabletop and interactive surface technologies. As a still young and very active community, we embrace the growth of the discipline in a wide variety of areas, including innovations in ITS hardware, software, interaction design, and studies expanding our understanding of design considerations of ITS technologies and of their applications in modern society. ITS 2011 will bring together top researchers and practitioners who are interested in both the technical and human aspects of interactive tabletop and surface technologies. As in the last year, ITS 2011 has added a separate day for a doctoral symposium and tutorials before the main conference. We also have co-located workshop Dexis 2011 on November 13th, focusing on the use of interactive surfaces for visual data exploration. We received 96 full paper and note submissions (56 papers and 40 notes) this year. After a thorough review process, the program committee accepted 32 submissions (acceptance rate of 33.3% in total), which include 19 papers (33.9%) and 13 notes (32.5%). Each anonymous submission was assigned primary and secondary program committee members. The primary committee member assigned at least two external reviewers for each submission, and the secondary at least one. After receiving the reviews, both program committee members wrote a meta-review for every submission. The program committee then met in Redmond, WA, USA on August 25 and 26, 2011, to examine each submission and select the top papers. At that moment all acceptances were conditional and they were finally accepted only after the authors provided a final revision addressing the committee's comments.},

 abstract = {We propose the concept and implementation of a graphical information hiding technique for interactive tabletops where users can view the information by simply casting real shadows. We placed three projectors (one in the rear and two in the front) in such a way that the rear one projects graphical information onto a tabletop surface, and the front ones project a complementary image, so that the combined image displayed on the surface becomes uniformly gray, thus hiding the information from the viewer. Users can view the hidden information by blocking the light from the front projector, revealing the complementary image that is being projected onto the occluder. We use the other front projector and polarization filters to make the complementary image projected onto the occluder also uniformly gray. Because the technique completely relies on optical phenomena, users can interact with the system without suffering from any false recognitions or delays.},

 abstract = {We present an evaluation of text entry methods for tabletop displays given small display space allocations, an increasingly important design constraint as tabletops become collaborative platforms. Small space is already a requirement of mobile text entry methods, and these can often be easily ported to tabletop settings. The purpose of this work is to determine whether these mobile text entry methods are equally useful for tabletop displays, or whether there are unique aspects of text entry on large, horizontal surfaces that influence design. Our evaluation consists of two studies designed to elicit differences between the mobile and tabletop domains. Results show that standard soft keyboards perform best, even at small space allocations. Furthermore, occlusion-reduction methods like Shift do not yield significant improvements to text entry; we speculate that this is due to the low ratio of resolution per surface units (i.e., DPI) for current tabletops.},
