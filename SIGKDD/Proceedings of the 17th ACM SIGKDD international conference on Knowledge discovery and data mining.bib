The target workload is large (10 -- 100 million) Enterprise document corpuses. At these scales, anything short of linear scale and incremental is costly to deploy. These three algorithms give rise to three weighted physical indexes: Tag Index (top keywords in each document); Document Similarity Index (top closely related documents given any document); and Semantic Phrase Similarity Index (top semantically related phrases, given any phrase), which are then query-able through the SQL interface. The need for specifically creating these three indexes was motivated by observing typical stages of document research, and gap analysis, given current tools and technology at the Enterprise. We describe the mining algorithms and architecture, and also outline some compelling user experiences that are enabled by the indexes.},

 abstract = {Collaborative filtering has been extensively studied in the context of ratings prediction. However, industrial recommender systems often aim at predicting a few items of immediate interest to the user, typically products that (s)he is likely to buy in the near future. In a collaborative filtering setting, the prediction may be based on the user's purchase history rather than rating information, which may be unreliable or unavailable. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of various collaborative filtering algorithms on a real-world dataset of purchase history from customers in a store of a French home improvement and building supplies chain. These experiments are part of the development of a prototype recommender system for salespeople in the store. We show how different settings for training and applying the models, as well as the introduction of domain knowledge may dramatically influence both the absolute and the relative performances of the different algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the influence of these parameters on the quality of the predictions of recommender systems has rarely been reported in the literature.},

 abstract = {The proliferation of online social networks, and the concomitant accumulation of user data, give rise to hotly debated issues of privacy, security, and control. One specific challenge is the sharing or public release of anonymized data without accidentally leaking personally identifiable information (PII). Unfortunately, it is often difficult to ascertain that sophisticated statistical techniques, potentially employing additional external data sources, are unable to break anonymity. In this paper, we consider an instance of this problem, where the object of interest is the structure of a social network, i.e., a graph describing users and their links. Recent work demonstrates that anonymizing node identities may not be sufficient to keep the network private: the availability of node and link data from another domain, which is correlated with the anonymized network, has been used to re-identify the anonymized nodes. This paper is about conditions under which such a de-anonymization process is possible. We attempt to shed light on the following question: can we assume that a sufficiently sparse network is inherently anonymous, in the sense that even with unlimited computational power, de-anonymization is impossible? Our approach is to introduce a random graph model for a version of the de-anonymization problem, which is parameterized by the expected node degree and a similarity parameter that controls the correlation between two graphs over the same vertex set. We find simple conditions on these parameters delineating the boundary of privacy, and show that the mean node degree need only grow slightly faster than log n with network size n for nodes to be identifiable. Our results have policy implications for sharing of anonymized network information.},

This creates an opportunity for designers to build items that are likely to attract desirable tags when published. In this paper, we consider a novel optimization problem: given a training dataset of existing items with their user-submitted tags, and a query set of desirable tags, design the k best new items expected to attract the maximum number of desirable tags. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, even if simple Naive Bayes Classifiers are used for tag prediction. We present two principled algorithms for solving this problem: (a) an exact "two-tier" algorithm (based on top-k querying techniques), which performs much better than the naive brute-force algorithm and works well for moderate problem instances, and (b) a novel polynomial-time approximation algorithm with provable error bound for larger problem instances. We conduct detailed experiments on synthetic and real data crawled from the web to evaluate the efficiency and quality of our proposed algorithms.},

@inproceedings{Simon:2011:UAT:2020408.2020469,
 abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with progressive cognitive decline leading to dementia. The atrophy/loss of brain structure as seen on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is strongly correlated with the severity of the cognitive impairment in AD. In this paper, we set out to find associations between predefined regions of the brain (regions of interest; ROIs) and the severity of the disease. Specifically, we use these associations to address two important issues in AD: (i) typical versus atypical atrophy patterns and (ii) the origin and direction of progression of atrophy, which is currently under debate. We observed that each AD-related ROI is associated with a wide range of severity and that the difference between ROIs is merely a difference in severity distribution. To model differences between the severity distribution of a subpopulation (with significant atrophy in certain ROIs) and the severity distribution of the entire population, we developed the concept of Distributional Association Rules. Using the Distributional Association Rules, we clustered ROIs into disease subsystems. We define a disease subsystem as a contiguous set of ROIs that are collectively implicated in AD. AD is known to be heterogeneous in the sense that multiple sets of ROIs may be related to the disease in a population. We proposed an enhancement to the association rule mining where the algorithm only discovers association rules with ROIs that form an approximately contiguous volume. Next, we applied these association rules to infer the direction of disease progression based on the support measures of the association rules. We also developed a novel statistical test to determine the statistical significance of the discovered direction. We evaluated the proposed method on the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) prospective patient cohorts. The key achievements of the methodology is that it accurately identified larger disease subsystems implicated in typical and atypical AD and it successfully mapped the directions of disease progression. The wealth of data available in Radiology gives rise to opportunities for applying this methodology to map out the trajectory of several other diseases, e.g. other neuro-degenerative diseases and cancers, most notably, breast cancer. The applicability of this method is not limited to image data, as associating predictors with severity provides valuable information in most areas of medicine as well as other industries.},

For example, given two large graphs from the same domain, how can we use information in one to do classification in the other (i.e., perform across-network classification or transfer learning on graphs)? Also, if one of the graphs is anonymized, how can we use information in one to de-anonymize the other? The key step in all such graph mining tasks is to find effective node features. We propose ReFeX (Recursive Feature eXtraction), a novel algorithm, that recursively combines local (node-based) features with neighborhood (egonet-based) features; and outputs regional features -- capturing "behavioral" information. We demonstrate how these powerful regional features can be used in within-network and across-network classification and de-anonymization tasks -- without relying on homophily, or the availability of class labels. The contributions of our work are as follows: (a) ReFeX is scalable and (b) it is effective, capturing regional ("behavioral") information in large graphs. We report experiments on real graphs from various domains with over 1M edges, where ReFeX outperforms its competitors on typical graph mining tasks like network classification and de-anonymization.},

 abstract = {The department-store retailer John Wanamaker famously stated, "Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted--I just don't know which half." Compared with the measurement of advertising effectiveness in traditional media, online advertisers and publishers have considerable data advantages, including individual-level data on advertising exposures, clicks, searches, and other online user behaviors. However, as I shall discuss in this talk, the science of advertising effectiveness requires more than just quantity of data - even more important is the quality of the data. In particular, in many cases, using various statistical techniques with observational data leads to incorrect measurements. To measure the true causal effects, we run controlled experiments that suppress advertising to a control group, much like the placebo in a drug trial. With experiments to determine the ground truth, we can show that in many circumstances, observational-data techniques rely on identifying assumptions that prove to be incorrect, and they produce estimates differing wildly from the truth. Despite increases in data availability, Wanamaker's complaint remains just as true for online advertising as it was for print advertising a century ago. In this talk, I will discuss recent advances in running randomized experiments online, measuring the impact of online display advertising on consumer behavior. Interesting results include the measurable effects of online advertising on offline transactions, the impact on viewers who do not click the ads, the surprisingly large effects of frequency of exposure, and the heterogeneity of advertising effectiveness across users in different demographic groups or geographic locations. I also show that sample sizes of a million or more customers may be necessary to get enough precision for statistical significance of economically important effects - so we have just reached the cusp of being able to measure effects precisely with present technology. (By comparison, previous controlled experiments using split-cable TV systems, with sample sizes in the mere thousands, have lacked statistical power to measure precise effects for a given campaign.) As I show with several examples that establish the ground truth using controlled experiments, the bias in observational studies can be extremely large, over-or-underestimating the true causal effects by an order of magnitude. I will discuss the (implicit or explicit) modeling assumptions made by researchers using observational data, and identify several reasons why these assumptions are violated in practice. I will also discuss future directions in using experiments to measure advertising effectiveness.},

Most of the existing solutions that ensure ∈-differential privacy are based on an interactive model, where the data miner is only allowed to pose aggregate queries to the database. In this paper, we propose the first anonymization algorithm for the non-interactive setting based on the generalization technique. The proposed solution first probabilistically generalizes the raw data and then adds noise to guarantee ∈-differential privacy.

 abstract = {Sequential pattern discovery is a well-studied field in data mining. Episodes are sequential patterns describing events that often occur in the vicinity of each other. Episodes can impose restrictions to the order of the events, which makes them a versatile technique for describing complex patterns in the sequence. Most of the research on episodes deals with special cases such as serial, parallel, and injective episodes, while discovering general episodes is understudied. In this paper we extend the definition of an episode in order to be able to represent cases where events often occur simultaneously. We present an efficient and novel miner for discovering frequent and closed general episodes. Such a task presents unique challenges. Firstly, we cannot define closure based on frequency. We solve this by computing a more conservative closure that we use to reduce the search space and discover the closed episodes as a postprocessing step. Secondly, episodes are traditionally presented as directed acyclic graphs. We argue that this representation has drawbacks leading to redundancy in the output. We solve these drawbacks by defining a subset relationship in such a way that allows us to remove the redundant episodes. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm and the need for using closed episodes empirically on synthetic and real-world datasets.},

 abstract = {Ensemble learning has become a common tool for data stream classification, being able to handle large volumes of stream data and concept drifting. Previous studies focus on building accurate prediction models from stream data. However, a linear scan of a large number of base classifiers in the ensemble during prediction incurs significant costs in response time, preventing ensemble learning from being practical for many real world time-critical data stream applications, such as Web traffic stream monitoring, spam detection, and intrusion detection. In these applications, data streams usually arrive at a speed of GB/second, and it is necessary to classify each stream record in a timely manner. To address this problem, we propose a novel Ensemble-tree (E-tree for short) indexing structure to organize all base classifiers in an ensemble for fast prediction. On one hand, E-trees treat ensembles as spatial databases and employ an R-tree like height-balanced structure to reduce the expected prediction time from linear to sub-linear complexity. On the other hand, E-trees can automatically update themselves by continuously integrating new classifiers and discarding outdated ones, well adapting to new trends and patterns underneath data streams. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate the performance of our approach.},

 abstract = {Matrix factorizations---where a given data matrix is approximated by a product of two or more factor matrices---are powerful data mining tools. Among other tasks, matrix factorizations are often used to separate global structure from noise. This, however, requires solving the `model order selection problem' of determining where fine-grained structure stops, and noise starts, i.e., what is the proper size of the factor matrices. Boolean matrix factorization (BMF)---where data, factors, and matrix product are Boolean---has received increased attention from the data mining community in recent years. The technique has desirable properties, such as high interpretability and natural sparsity. But so far no method for selecting the correct model order for BMF has been available. In this paper we propose to use the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle for this task. Besides solving the problem, this well-founded approach has numerous benefits, e.g., it is automatic, does not require a likelihood function, is fast, and, as experiments show, is highly accurate. We formulate the description length function for BMF in general---making it applicable for any BMF algorithm. We extend an existing algorithm for BMF to use MDL to identify the best Boolean matrix factorization, analyze the complexity of the problem, and perform an extensive experimental evaluation to study its behavior.},

Our main contribution is a semi-supervised hierarchical model called Wikipedia-based Pachinko Allocation Model} (WPAM) that exploits: (1) All words in the Wikipedia corpus to learn word-entity associations (unlike existing approaches that only use words in a small fixed window around annotated entity references in Wikipedia pages), (2) Wikipedia annotations to appropriately bias the assignment of entity labels to annotated (and co-occurring unannotated) words during model learning, and (3) Wikipedia's category hierarchy to capture co-occurrence patterns among entities. We also propose a scheme for pruning spurious nodes from Wikipedia's crowd-sourced category hierarchy. In our experiments with multiple real-life datasets, we show that WPAM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by as much as 16% in terms of disambiguation accuracy.},

 abstract = {Users can rarely reveal their information need in full detail to a search engine within 1--2 words, so search engines need to "hedge their bets" and present diverse results within the precious 10 response slots. Diversity in ranking is of much recent interest. Most existing solutions estimate the marginal utility of an item given a set of items already in the response, and then use variants of greedy set cover. Others design graphs with the items as nodes and choose diverse items based on visit rates (PageRank). Here we introduce a radically new and natural formulation of diversity as finding centers in resistive graphs. Unlike in PageRank, we do not specify the edge resistances (equivalently, conductances) and ask for node visit rates. Instead, we look for a sparse set of center nodes so that the effective conductance from the center to the rest of the graph has maximum entropy. We give a cogent semantic justification for turning PageRank thus on its head. In marked deviation from prior work, our edge resistances are learnt from training data. Inference and learning are NP-hard, but we give practical solutions. In extensive experiments with subtopic retrieval, social network search, and document summarization, our approach convincingly surpasses recently-published diversity algorithms like subtopic cover, max-marginal relevance (MMR), Grasshopper, DivRank, and SVMdiv.},

 abstract = {Combining correlated information from multiple contexts can significantly improve predictive accuracy in recommender problems. Such information from multiple contexts is often available in the form of several incomplete matrices spanning a set of entities like users, items, features, and so on. Existing methods simultaneously factorize these matrices by sharing a single set of factors for entities across all contexts. We show that such a strategy may introduce significant bias in estimates and propose a new model that ameliorates this issue by positing local, context-specific factors for entities. To avoid over-fitting in contexts with sparse data, the local factors are connected through a shared global model. This sharing of parameters allows information to flow across contexts through multivariate regressions among local factors, instead of enforcing exactly the same factors for an entity, everywhere. Model fitting is done in an EM framework, we show that the E-step can be fitted through a fast multi-resolution Kalman filter algorithm that ensures scalability. Experiments on benchmark and real-world Yahoo! datasets clearly illustrate the usefulness of our approach. Our model significantly improves predictive accuracy, especially in cold-start scenarios.},

In many real world applications, data is often represented from different perspectives, which correspond to multiple views. For example, a web page can be described by its contents and its associated links. However, most existing transfer learning methods fail to capture the multi-view {nature}, and might not be best suited for such applications. To better leverage both the labeled data from the source domain and the features from different views, {this paper proposes} a general framework: Multi-View Transfer Learning with a Large Margin Approach (MVTL-LM). On one hand, labeled data from the source domain is effectively utilized to construct a large margin classifier; on the other hand, the data from both domains is employed to impose consistencies among multiple views. As an instantiation of this framework, we propose an efficient optimization method, which is guaranteed to converge to ε precision in O(1/ε) steps. Furthermore, we analyze its error bound, which improves over existing results of related methods. An extensive set of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method over state-of-the-art techniques.},

In this paper, we show how response prediction can be viewed as a problem of matrix completion, and propose to solve it using matrix factorization techniques from collaborative filtering (CF). We point out the two crucial differences between standard CF problems and response prediction, namely the requirement of predicting probabilities rather than scores, and the issue of confidence in matrix entries. We address these issues using a matrix factorization analogue of logistic regression, and by applying a principled confidence-weighting scheme to its objective. We show how this factorization can be seamlessly combined with explicit features or side-information for pages and ads, which let us combine the benefits of both approaches. Finally, we combat the extreme sparsity of response prediction data by incorporating hierarchical information about the pages and ads into our factorization model. Experiments on three very large real-world datasets show that our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for response prediction.},

 abstract = {Marketers often rely on a set of descriptive segments, or qualitative subsets of the population, to specify the audiences of targeted advertising campaigns. For example, the descriptive segment "Empty Nesters" might describe a desirable target audience for extended vacation package offers. While some segments may be easily described and generated using demographic data as ground truth, others such as "Soccer Moms" or "Urban Hipsters" reflect a combination of demographic and behavioral attributes. Ideally, these attributes would be available as the basis for ground truth labeling of a classifier training set or even direct member selection from the population. Unfortunately, ground truth attributes are often scarce or unavailable, in which case a proxy labeling scheme is needed. We devise a method for labeling a population according to criteria based on a postulated set of shopping behaviors specific to a descriptive segment. We then perform supervised binary classification on this labeled dataset in order to discover additional identifying patterns of behavior typical of labeled positives in the population. Finally, the resulting classifier is used to perform selection from the population into the segment, extending reach to cookies who may not have exhibited the postulated behaviors but likely belong in the segment. We validate our approach by comparing a descriptive segment trained on ground truth to one trained on behavioral attributes only. We show that our behavior-based approach produces classifiers having performance comparable to that of a classifier trained on the ground truth data.},

In our previous work, we proposed a scalable log-linear model called LMMH (Log-Linear Models for Multiple Hierarchies) that combats data sparsity at granular levels through small sample size corrections that borrow strength from rate estimates at coarser resolutions. This paper extends our previous work in two directions. First, we model excess heterogeneity by fitting local LMMH models to relatively homogeneous subsets of the data. To ensure scalable computation, these subsets are induced through a decision tree, we call this Treed-LMMH. Second, the Treed-LMMH method is coupled with temporal smoothing procedure based on a fast Kalman filter style algorithm. We show that simultaneously performing hierarchical and temporal smoothing leads to significant improvement in predictive accuracy.

Our algorithm makes no initial assumptions about how the groups connect, and performs well even when faced with quite general types of network structure.

From a theoretical perspective, we give the first analysis that shows several clustering algorithms are in MRC0, a theoretical MapReduce class introduced by Karloff et al. [26]. Our algorithms use sampling to decrease the data size and they run a time consuming clustering algorithm such as local search or Lloyd's algorithm on the resulting data set. Our algorithms have sufficient flexibility to be used in practice since they run in a constant number of MapReduce rounds. We complement these results by performing experiments using our algorithms. We compare the empirical performance of our algorithms to several sequential and parallel algorithms for the k-median problem. The experiments show that our algorithms' solutions are similar to or better than the other algorithms' solutions. Furthermore, on data sets that are sufficiently large, our algorithms are faster than the other parallel algorithms that we tested.},

 abstract = {In scientific research, it is often difficult to express information needs as simple keyword queries. We present a more natural way of searching for relevant scientific literature. Rather than a string of keywords, we define a query as a small set of papers deemed relevant to the research task at hand. By optimizing an objective function based on a fine-grained notion of influence between documents, our approach efficiently selects a set of highly relevant articles. Moreover, as scientists trust some authors more than others, results are personalized to individual preferences. In a user study, researchers found the papers recommended by our method to be more useful, trustworthy and diverse than those selected by popular alternatives, such as Google Scholar and a state-of-the-art topic modeling approach.},

 abstract = {In an interconnected and dynamic world, the evolution of one entity may cause a series of significant value changes for some others. For example, the currency inflation of Thailand caused the currency slump of other Asian countries, which eventually led to the financial crisis of 1997. We call such high impact entities shakers. To discover shakers, we first introduce the concept of a cascading graph to capture the causality relationships among evolving entities over some period of time, and then infer shakers from the graph. In a cascading graph, nodes represent entities and weighted links represent the causality effects. In order to find hidden shakers in such a graph, two scoring functions are proposed, each of which estimates how much the target entity can affect the values of some others. The idea is to artificially inject a significant change on the target entity, and estimate its direct and indirect influence on the others, by following an inference rule under the Markovian assumption. Both scoring functions are proven to be only dependent on the structure of a cascading graph and can be calculated in polynomial time. Experiments included three datasets in social sciences. Without directly applicable previous methods, we modified three graphical models as baselines. The two proposed scoring functions can effectively capture those high impact entities. For example, in the experiment to discover stock market shakers, the proposed models outperform the three baselines by as much as 50% in accuracy with the ground truth obtained from Yahoo!~Finance.},

 abstract = {As the use of mobile devices increases, a location-based service (LBS) becomes increasingly popular because it provides more convenient context-aware services. However, LBS introduces problematic issues for location privacy due to the nature of the service. Location privacy protection methods based on k-anonymity and l-diversity have been proposed to provide anonymized use of LBS. However, the k-anonymity and l-diversity methods still can endanger the user's privacy because location semantic information could easily be breached while using LBS. This paper presents a novel location privacy protection technique, which protects the location semantics from an adversary. In our scheme, location semantics are first learned from location data. Then, the trusted-anonymization server performs the anonymization using the location semantic information by cloaking with semantically heterogeneous locations. Thus, the location semantic information is kept secure as the cloaking is done with semantically heterogeneous locations and the true location information is not delivered to the LBS applications. This paper proposes algorithms for learning location semantics and achieving semantically secure cloaking.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we develop a semantic annotation technique for location-based social networks to automatically annotate all places with category tags which are a crucial prerequisite for location search, recommendation services, or data cleaning. Our annotation algorithm learns a binary support vector machine (SVM) classifier for each tag in the tag space to support multi-label classification. Based on the check-in behavior of users, we extract features of places from i) explicit patterns (EP) of individual places and ii) implicit relatedness (IR) among similar places. The features extracted from EP are summarized from all check-ins at a specific place. The features from IR are derived by building a novel network of related places (NRP) where similar places are linked by virtual edges. Upon NRP, we determine the probability of a category tag for each place by exploring the relatedness of places. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study based on a real dataset collected from a location-based social network, Whrrl. The results demonstrate the suitability of our approach and show the strength of taking both EP and IR into account in feature extraction.},

 abstract = {Advances in tourism economics have enabled us to collect massive amounts of travel tour data. If properly analyzed, this data can be a source of rich intelligence for providing real-time decision making and for the provision of travel tour recommendations. However, tour recommendation is quite different from traditional recommendations, because the tourist's choice is directly affected by the travel cost, which includes the financial cost and the time. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of cost-aware tour recommendation. Along this line, we develop two cost-aware latent factor models to recommend travel packages by considering both the travel cost and the tourist's interests. Specifically, we first design a cPMF model, which models the tourist's cost with a 2-dimensional vector. Also, in this cPMF model, the tourist's interests and the travel cost are learnt by exploring travel tour data. Furthermore, in order to model the uncertainty in the travel cost, we further introduce a Gaussian prior into the cPMF model and develop the GcPMF model, where the Gaussian prior is used to express the uncertainty of the travel cost. Finally, experiments on real-world travel tour data show that the cost-aware recommendation models outperform state-of-the-art latent factor models with a significant margin. Also, the GcPMF model with the Gaussian prior can better capture the impact of the uncertainty of the travel cost, and thus performs better than the cPMF model.},

Data volumes are growing exponentially, while businesses are striving to deploy sophisticated and computationally intensive predictive analytics. Often, massive data is stored in a data warehouse running on dedicated parallel hardware, but advanced analytics is performed on a separate compute platform. Moving data from the data warehouse to the compute environment can constitute a significant bottleneck. Organizations resort to considering only a fraction of their data or refreshing their analyses infrequently. To address the data movement bottleneck and take full advantage of parallel data warehouse platforms, vendors are offering new in-database analytics capabilities. They are opening up their platforms, allowing users to run their own user-defined functions and statistical models as well as vendor- and partner-supplied advanced analytics on the database platform, close to the data, in parallel, without transporting the data through a host node or corporate network. In this talk, we will present the need for in-database analytics and discuss a number of the new solutions available, highlighting case studies where solution times have been reduced from hours to minutes or seconds.},

It has many important applications in data mining and information retrieval. However, in the literature, there is a lack of a general framework to deal with multi-relational data for co-ranking. The main contribution of this paper is to (i) propose a framework (MultiRank) to determine the importance of both objects and relations simultaneously based on a probability distribution computed from multi-relational data; (ii) show the existence and uniqueness of such probability distribution so that it can be used for co-ranking for objects and relations very effectively; and (iii) develop an efficient iterative algorithm to solve a set of tensor (multivariate polynomial) equations to obtain such probability distribution. Extensive experiments on real-world data suggest that the proposed framework is able to provide a co-ranking scheme for objects and relations successfully. Experimental results have also shown that our algorithm is computationally efficient, and effective for identification of interesting and explainable co-ranking results.},

 abstract = {Mining detailed opinions buried in the vast amount of review text data is an important, yet quite challenging task with widespread applications in multiple domains. Latent Aspect Rating Analysis (LARA) refers to the task of inferring both opinion ratings on topical aspects (e.g., location, service of a hotel) and the relative weights reviewers have placed on each aspect based on review content and the associated overall ratings. A major limitation of previous work on LARA is the assumption of pre-specified aspects by keywords. However, the aspect information is not always available, and it may be difficult to pre-define appropriate aspects without a good knowledge about what aspects are actually commented on in the reviews. In this paper, we propose a unified generative model for LARA, which does not need pre-specified aspect keywords and simultaneously mines 1) latent topical aspects, 2) ratings on each identified aspect, and 3) weights placed on different aspects by a reviewer. Experiment results on two different review data sets demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively perform the Latent Aspect Rating Analysis task without the supervision of aspect keywords. Because of its generality, the proposed model can be applied to explore all kinds of opinionated text data containing overall sentiment judgments and support a wide range of interesting application tasks, such as aspect-based opinion summarization, personalized entity ranking and recommendation, and reviewer behavior analysis.},

User profiles are temporal, and changes in a user's activity patterns are particularly useful for improved prediction and recommendation. For instance, an increased interest in car-related web pages may well suggest that the user might be shopping for a new vehicle.In this paper we present a comprehensive statistical framework for user profiling based on topic models which is able to capture such effects in a fully \emph{unsupervised} fashion. Our method models topical interests of a user dynamically where both the user association with the topics and the topics themselves are allowed to vary over time, thus ensuring that the profiles remain current. We describe a streaming, distributed inference algorithm which is able to handle tens of millions of users. Our results show that our model contributes towards improved behavioral targeting of display advertising relative to baseline models that do not incorporate topical and/or temporal dependencies. As a side-effect our model yields human-understandable results which can be used in an intuitive fashion by advertisers.},

In this research, we aim to address some critical issues related to privacy protection: Would the highest privacy settings guarantee a secure protection? Given the open nature of social networking sites, is it possible to manage one's privacy protection? With the diversity of one's social media friends, how can one figure out an effective approach to balance between vulnerability and privacy? We present a novel way to define a vulnerable friend from an individual user's perspective is dependent on whether or not the user's friends' privacy settings protect the friend and the individual's network of friends (which includes the user). As a single vulnerable friend in a user's social network might place all friends at risk, we resort to experiments and observe how much security an individual user can improve by unfriending a vulnerable friend. We also show how privacy weakens if newly accepted friends are unguarded or unprotected. This work provides a large-scale evaluation of new security and privacy indexes using a Facebook dataset. We present and discuss a new perspective for reasoning about social networking security. When a user accepts a new friend, the user should ensure that the new friend is not an increased security risk with the potential of negatively impacting the entire friend network. Additionally, by leveraging the indexes proposed and employing new strategies for unfriending vulnerable friends, it is possible to further improve security and privacy without changing the social networking site's existing architecture.},

 abstract = {Multi-task learning (MTL) aims at improving the generalization performance by utilizing the intrinsic relationships among multiple related tasks. A key assumption in most MTL algorithms is that all tasks are related, which, however, may not be the case in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a robust multi-task learning (RMTL) algorithm which learns multiple tasks simultaneously as well as identifies the irrelevant (outlier) tasks. Specifically, the proposed RMTL algorithm captures the task relationships using a low-rank structure, and simultaneously identifies the outlier tasks using a group-sparse structure. The proposed RMTL algorithm is formulated as a non-smooth convex (unconstrained) optimization problem. We propose to adopt the accelerated proximal method (APM) for solving such an optimization problem. The key component in APM is the computation of the proximal operator, which can be shown to admit an analytic solution. We also theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the RMTL algorithm. In particular, we derive a key property of the optimal solution to RMTL; moreover, based on this key property, we establish a theoretical bound for characterizing the learning performance of RMTL. Our experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

Our key ideas include: 1) separating marginal distributions and their dependencies using copulas and 2) online extension of a recently-developed "expectation minimization of description length," which enable us to efficiently learn types of both marginal distributions and copulas as well as their parameters. The proposed method provides not only good performance in applications, but also scalable, automatic model selection, which greatly reduces the intensive modeling costs in data mining processes. We show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in application to density estimation and to anomaly detection.},

 abstract = {In many data mining exercises, we see information that appears on the surface to demonstrate a particular conclusion. But closer examination of the data reveals that these results are indeed misleading. In this session, we will examine this notion of misleading results in three areas: Statistical Issues Statistical issues such as multicollinearity and outliers can impact results dramatically. We will first outline how these statistical issues can provide misleading results. At the same time, we will demonstrate how the data mining practitioner overcomes these issues through data analysis approaches that provide both more meaningful and non-misleading results to the business community. Overstating of Results From a business standpoint, we will also look at results that appear to be too good to be true. In other words, there appears to be some overstating of results within a given data mining solution. Initially, we will discuss how to identify these situations. Secondly, we will outline what causes this overstatement of results and detail our approach on how we would overcome this predicament. Overfitting Another topic for discussion is overfitting of results. This is particularly the case when building predictive models. In this section of the seminar, we will define what overfitting is and why it is becoming more relevant for understanding by the business community. Once again, analytical approaches will be discussed in terms of how to best handle this issue. We present two case studies that demonstrate how our principled 4-step approach can be used to solve challenging data mining problems. These 4 steps are as follows: How to identify the problem How we construct the right data environment to conduct our analytics What kind of analytics are employed which include techniques such as correlation analysis, EDA reports, logistic regression, and gains charts. More importantly, we discuss how to interpret the output in terms of the actual impact to the business (i.e. increased response rate and ultimately increased ROI.) How do we apply the learning to a future initiative and what were the actual results},

 abstract = {In recent years social media have become indispensable tools for information dissemination, operating in tandem with traditional media outlets such as newspapers, and it has become critical to understand the interaction between the new and old sources of news. Although social media as well as traditional media have attracted attention from several research communities, most of the prior work has been limited to a single medium. In addition temporal analysis of these sources can provide an understanding of how information spreads and evolves. Modeling temporal dynamics while considering multiple sources is a challenging research problem. In this paper we address the problem of modeling text streams from two news sources - Twitter and Yahoo! News. Our analysis addresses both their individual properties (including temporal dynamics) and their inter-relationships. This work extends standard topic models by allowing each text stream to have both local topics and shared topics. For temporal modeling we associate each topic with a time-dependent function that characterizes its popularity over time. By integrating the two models, we effectively model the temporal dynamics of multiple correlated text streams in a unified framework. We evaluate our model on a large-scale dataset, consisting of text streams from both Twitter and news feeds from Yahoo! News. Besides overcoming the limitations of existing models, we show that our work achieves better perplexity on unseen data and identifies more coherent topics. We also provide analysis of finding real-world events from the topics obtained by our model.},

During the campaign and the post-campaign period we monitor the user search queries and we label them as relevant or irrelevant to the campaign using techniques that leverage the bipartite query-URL click graph. Our results indicate that users who are exposed to the advertising campaign submit 5% to 25% more queries that are relevant to it compared to the unexposed users. Using the social graph of the experiment users, we also explore how users are affected by their friends who are exposed to ads. Our results indicate that a user with exposed friends is more likely to submit queries relevant to the campaign, as compared to a user without exposed friends. The result is surprising given that the display advertising campaign that we study does not include any incentive for social action, e.g., discount for recommending friends.},

 abstract = {Link prediction systems have been largely adopted to recommend new friends in online social networks using data about social interactions. With the soaring adoption of location-based social services it becomes possible to take advantage of an additional source of information: the places people visit. In this paper we study the problem of designing a link prediction system for online location-based social networks. We have gathered extensive data about one of these services, Gowalla, with periodic snapshots to capture its temporal evolution. We study the link prediction space, finding that about 30% of new links are added among "place-friends", i.e., among users who visit the same places. We show how this prediction space can be made 15 times smaller, while still 66% of future connections can be discovered. Thus, we define new prediction features based on the properties of the places visited by users which are able to discriminate potential future links among them. Building on these findings, we describe a supervised learning framework which exploits these prediction features to predict new links among friends-of-friends and place-friends. Our evaluation shows how the inclusion of information about places and related user activity offers high link prediction performance. These results open new directions for real-world link recommendation systems on location-based social networks.},

 abstract = {Personalization is ubiquitous in modern online applications as it provides significant improvements in user experience by adapting it to inferred user preferences. However, there are increasing concerns related to issues of privacy and control of the user data that is aggregated by online systems to power personalized experiences. These concerns are particularly significant for user profile aggregation in online advertising. This paper describes a practical, learning-driven client-side personalization approach for keyword advertising platforms, an emerging application previously not addressed in literature. Our approach relies on storing user-specific information entirely within the user's control (in a browser cookie or browser local storage), thus allowing the user to view, edit or purge it at any time (e.g., via a dedicated webpage). We develop a principled, utility-based formulation for the problem of iteratively updating user profiles stored client-side, which relies on calibrated prediction of future user activity. While optimal profile construction is NP-hard for pay-per-click advertising with bid increments, it can be efficiently solved via a greedy approximation algorithm guaranteed to provide a near-optimal solution due to the fact that keyword profile utility is submodular: it exhibits the property of diminishing returns with increasing profile size. We empirically evaluate client-side keyword profiles for keyword advertising on a large-scale dataset from a major search engine. Experiments demonstrate that predictive client-side personalization allows ad platforms to retain almost all of the revenue gains from personalization even if they give users the freedom to opt out of behavior tracking backed by server-side storage. Additionally, we show that advertisers can potentially increase their return on investment significantly by utilizing bid increments for keyword profiles in their ad campaigns.},

 abstract = {Most email applications devote a significant part of their real estate to organization mechanisms such as folders. Yet, we verified on the Yahoo! Mail service that 70% of email users have never defined a single folder. This implies that one of the most well known email features is underexploited. We propose here to revive the feature by providing a method for generating a lighter form of folders, or tags, benefiting even the most passive users. The method automatically associates, whenever possible, an appropriate semantic tag with a given email. This gives rise to an alternate mechanism for organizing and searching email. We advocate a novel modeling approach that exploits the overall population of users, thereby learning from the wisdom-of-crowds how to categorize messages. Given our massive user base, it is enough to learn from a minority of the users who label certain messages in order to label that kind of messages for the general population. We design a novel cascade classification approach, which copes with the severe scalability and accuracy constraints we are facing. Significant efficiency gains are achieved by working within a low dimensional latent space, and by using a novel hierarchical classifier. Precision level is controlled by separating the task into a two-phase classification process. We performed an extensive empirical study covering three different time periods, over 100 million messages, and thousands of candidate tags per message. The results are encouraging and compare favorably with alternative approaches. Our method successfully tags 72% of incoming email traffic. Performance-wise, the computational overhead, even on surge large traffic, is sufficiently low for our approach to be applicable in production on any large Web mail service.},

 abstract = {Graph ranking plays an important role in many applications, such as page ranking on web graphs and entity ranking on social networks. In applications, besides graph structure, rich information on nodes and edges and explicit or implicit human supervision are often available. In contrast, conventional algorithms (e.g., PageRank and HITS) compute ranking scores by only resorting to graph structure information. A natural question arises here, that is, how to effectively and efficiently leverage all the information to more accurately calculate graph ranking scores than the conventional algorithms, assuming that the graph is also very large. Previous work only partially tackled the problem, and the proposed solutions are also not satisfying. This paper addresses the problem and proposes a general framework as well as an efficient algorithm for graph ranking. Specifically, we define a semi-supervised learning framework for ranking of nodes on a very large graph and derive within our proposed framework an efficient algorithm called Semi-Supervised PageRank. In the algorithm, the objective function is defined based upon a Markov random walk on the graph. The transition probability and the reset probability of the Markov model are defined as parametric models based on features on nodes and edges. By minimizing the objective function, subject to a number of constraints derived from supervision information, we simultaneously learn the optimal parameters of the model and the optimal ranking scores of the nodes. Finally, we show that it is possible to make the algorithm efficient to handle a billion-node graph by taking advantage of the sparsity of the graph and implement it in the MapReduce logic. Experiments on real data from a commercial search engine show that the proposed algorithm can outperform previous algorithms on several tasks.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have shown that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to alteration in brain connectivity networks. One type of connectivity, called effective connectivity, defined as the directional relationship between brain regions, is essential to brain function. However, there have been few studies on modeling the effective connectivity of AD and characterizing its difference from normal controls (NC). In this paper, we investigate the sparse Bayesian Network (BN) for effective connectivity modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel formulation for the structure learning of BNs, which involves one L1-norm penalty term to impose sparsity and another penalty to ensure the learned BN to be a directed acyclic graph - a required property of BNs. We show, through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on eleven moderate and large benchmark networks with various sample sizes, that the proposed method has much improved learning accuracy and scalability compared with ten competing algorithms. We apply the proposed method to FDG-PET images of 42 AD and 67 NC subjects, and identify the effective connectivity models for AD and NC, respectively. Our study reveals that the effective connectivity of AD is different from that of NC in many ways, including the global-scale effective connectivity, intra-lobe, inter-lobe, and inter-hemispheric effective connectivity distributions, as well as the effective connectivity associated with specific brain regions. These findings are consistent with known pathology and clinical progression of AD, and will contribute to AD knowledge discovery.},

Disseminating such datasets offers remarkable opportunities for discovering interesting knowledge patterns, but may lead to serious privacy violations if sensitive patterns, such as business secrets, are disclosed. In this work, we consider how to sanitize data to prevent the disclosure of sensitive patterns during sequential pattern mining, while ensuring that the nonsensitive patterns can still be discovered. First, we re-define the problem of sequential pattern hiding to capture the information loss incurred by sanitization in terms of both events' modification (distortion) and lost nonsensitive knowledge patterns (side-effects). Second, we model sequences as graphs and propose two algorithms to solve the problem by operating on the graphs. The first algorithm attempts to sanitize data with minimal distortion, whereas the second focuses on reducing the side-effects. Extensive experiments show that our algorithms outperform the existing solution in terms of data distortion and side-effects and are more efficient.},

 abstract = {Graph classification has become an important and active research topic in the last decade. Current research on graph classification focuses on mining discriminative subgraph features under supervised settings. The basic assumption is that a large number of labeled graphs are available. However, labeling graph data is quite expensive and time consuming for many real-world applications. In order to reduce the labeling cost for graph data, we address the problem of how to select the most important graph to query for the label. This problem is challenging and different from conventional active learning problems because there is no predefined feature vector. Moreover, the subgraph enumeration problem is NP-hard. The active sample selection problem and the feature selection problem are correlated for graph data. Before we can solve the active sample selection problem, we need to find a set of optimal subgraph features. To address this challenge, we demonstrate how one can simultaneously estimate the usefulness of a query graph and a set of subgraph features. The idea is to maximize the dependency between subgraph features and graph labels using an active learning framework. We propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to search for the optimal query graph and optimal features simultaneously. Empirical studies on nine real-world tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain better accuracy on graph data than alternative approaches.},

 abstract = {A key task in analyzing social networks and other complex networks is role analysis: describing and categorizing nodes by how they interact with other nodes. Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent sets of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence. Unfortunately, the fastest algorithm known for graph automorphism is nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence is rare, a more meaningful task is measuring the role similarity between any two nodes. This task is closely related to the link-based similarity problem that SimRank addresses. However, SimRank and other existing simliarity measures are not sufficient because they do not guarantee to recognize automorphically or structurally equivalent nodes. This paper makes two contributions. First, we present and justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role similarity measure or metric. Second, we present RoleSim, a role similarity metric which satisfies these axioms and which can be computed with a simple iterative algorithm. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all the axiomatic properties and demonstrate its superior interpretative power on both synthetic and real datasets.},

Using cell phone location data, as well as data from two online location-based social networks, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human motion and dynamics. We find that humans experience a combination of periodic movement that is geographically limited and seemingly random jumps correlated with their social networks. Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more influenced by social network ties. We show that social relationships can explain about 10% to 30% of all human movement, while periodic behavior explains 50% to 70%. Based on our findings, we develop a model of human mobility that combines periodic short range movements with travel due to the social network structure. We show that our model reliably predicts the locations and dynamics of future human movement and gives an order of magnitude better performance than present models of human mobility.},

 abstract = {Data describing networks (communication networks, transaction networks, disease transmission networks, collaboration networks, etc.) is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. While this observational data is useful, it often only hints at the actual underlying social or technological structures which give rise to the interactions. For example, an email communication network provides useful insight but is not the same as the "real" social network among individuals. In this paper, we introduce the problem of graph identification, i.e., the discovery of the true graph structure underlying an observed network. We cast the problem as a probabilistic inference task, in which we must infer the nodes, edges, and node labels of a hidden graph, based on evidence provided by the observed network. This in turn corresponds to the problems of performing entity resolution, link prediction, and node labeling to infer the hidden graph. While each of these problems have been studied separately, they have never been considered together as a coherent task. We present a simple yet novel approach to address all three problems simultaneously. Our approach, called C3, consists of Coupled Collective Classifiers that are iteratively applied to propagate information among solutions to the problems. We empirically demonstrate that C3 is superior, in terms of both predictive accuracy and runtime, to state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches on three real-world problems.},

We consider the estimation of a joint probability density function of a d-dimensional random vector X and define a piecewise constant estimator structured as a decision tree. The integrated squared error is minimized to learn the tree. We show that the method is nonparametric: under standard conditions of nonparametric density estimation, DETs are shown to be asymptotically consistent. In addition, being decision trees, DETs perform automatic feature selection. They empirically exhibit the interpretability, adaptability and feature selection properties of supervised decision trees while incurring slight loss in accuracy over other nonparametric density estimators. Hence they might be able to avoid the curse of dimensionality if the true density is sparse in dimensions. We believe that density estimation trees provide a new tool for exploratory data analysis with unique capabilities.},

 abstract = {Inferring causal networks behind observed data is an active area of research with wide applicability to areas such as epidemiology, microbiology and social science. In particular recent research has focused on identifying how information propagates through the Internet. This research has so far only used temporal features of observations, and while reasonable results have been achieved, there is often further information which can be used. In this paper we show that additional features of the observed data can be used very effectively to improve an existing method. Our particular example is one of inferring an underlying network for how text is reused in the Internet, although the general approach is applicable to other inference methods and information sources. We develop a method to identify how a piece of text evolves as it moves through an underlying network and how substring information can be used to narrow down where in the evolutionary process a particular observation at a node lies. Hence we narrow down the number of ways the node could have acquired the infection. Text reuse is detected using a suffix tree which is also used to identify the substring relations between chunks of reused text. We then use a modification of the NetCover method to infer the underlying network. Experimental results -- on both synthetic and real life data -- show that using more information than just timing leads to greater accuracy in the inferred networks.},

The exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff strategy is a well-known technique for online learning with incomplete feedback (i.e., bandit setup). Banditron [8], a multi-class online learning algorithm for bandit setting, maximizes the run-time gain by balancing between exploration and exploitation with a fixed tradeoff parameter. The performance of Banditron can be quite sensitive to the choice of the tradeoff parameter and therefore effective algorithms to automatically tune this parameter is desirable. In this paper, we propose three learning strategies to automatically adjust the tradeoff parameter for Banditron.

Resting on the analysis of file contents extracted from the file samples, like Application Programming Interface (API) calls, instruction sequences, and binary strings, data mining methods such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines have been used for malware detection. However, besides file contents, relations among file samples, such as a "Downloader" is always associated with many Trojans, can provide invaluable information about the properties of file samples. In this paper, we study how file relations can be used to improve malware detection results and develop a file verdict system (named "Valkyrie") building on a semi-parametric classifier model to combine file content and file relations together for malware detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of using both file content and file relations for malware detection. A comprehensive experimental study on a large collection of PE files obtained from the clients of anti-malware products of Comodo Security Solutions Incorporation is performed to compare various malware detection approaches. Promising experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy and efficiency of our Valkyrie system outperform other popular anti-malware software tools such as Kaspersky AntiVirus and McAfee VirusScan, as well as other alternative data mining based detection systems.},

@inproceedings{Wang:2011:TRS:2020408.2020420,
 abstract = {Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are among the most popular and successful classification algorithms. Kernel SVMs often reach state-of-the-art accuracies, but suffer from the curse of kernelization due to linear model growth with data size on noisy data. Linear SVMs have the ability to efficiently learn from truly large data, but they are applicable to a limited number of domains due to low representational power. To fill the representability and scalability gap between linear and nonlinear SVMs, we propose the Adaptive Multi-hyperplane Machine (AMM) algorithm that accomplishes fast training and prediction and has capability to solve nonlinear classification problems. AMM model consists of a set of hyperplanes (weights), each assigned to one of the multiple classes, and predicts based on the associated class of the weight that provides the largest prediction. The number of weights is automatically determined through an iterative algorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum. Since the generalization bound decreases with the number of weights, a weight pruning mechanism is proposed and analyzed. The experiments on several large data sets show that AMM is nearly as fast during training and prediction as the state-of-the-art linear SVM solver and that it can be orders of magnitude faster than kernel SVM. In accuracy, AMM is somewhere between linear and kernel SVMs. For example, on an OCR task with 8 million highly dimensional training examples, AMM trained in 300 seconds on a single-core processor had 0.54% error rate, which was significantly lower than 2.03% error rate of a linear SVM trained in the same time and comparable to 0.43% error rate of a kernel SVM trained in 2 days on 512 processors. The results indicate that AMM could be an attractive option when solving large-scale classification problems. The software is available at www.dabi.temple.edu/~vucetic/AMM.html.},

 abstract = {Real-time interaction, which enables live discussions, has become a key feature of most Web applications. In such an environment, the ability to automatically analyze user opinions and sentiments as discussions develop is a powerful resource known as real time sentiment analysis. However, this task comes with several challenges, including the need to deal with highly dynamic textual content that is characterized by changes in vocabulary and its subjective meaning and the lack of labeled data needed to support supervised classifiers. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning strategy to perform real time sentiment analysis. We identify a task - opinion holder bias prediction - which is strongly related to the sentiment analysis task; however, in constrast to sentiment analysis, it builds accurate models since the underlying relational data follows a stationary distribution. Instead of learning textual models to predict content polarity (i.e., the traditional sentiment analysis approach), we first measure the bias of social media users toward a topic, by solving a relational learning task over a network of users connected by endorsements (e.g., retweets in Twitter). We then analyze sentiments by transferring user biases to textual features. This approach works because while new terms may arise and old terms may change their meaning, user bias tends to be more consistent over time as a basic property of human behavior. Thus, we adopted user bias as the basis for building accurate classification models. We applied our model to posts collected from Twitter on two topics: the 2010 Brazilian Presidential Elections and the 2010 season of Brazilian Soccer League. Our results show that knowing the bias of only 10% of users generates an F1 accuracy level ranging from 80% to 90% in predicting user sentiment in tweets.},

 abstract = {The challenge of predicting retail sales on a product-by-product basis throughout a network of retail stores has been researched intensively by applied econometricians and statisticians for decades. The principal tools of analysis have been linear regression with Bayesian inspired adjustments to stabilize demand curve estimates. The scale of such analytics can be challenging as retailers often work with more than 100,000 products (SKUs) and typically operate networks of hundreds of brick and mortar stores. Department and grocery stores are excellent examples but fast food restaurants also require such detailed predictive modeling systems. Depending on the objectives of the company, predictions may be required for blocks of time spanning a week or more, or, as in the case of fast food operators, predictions are required for each 15-minute time interval of the operating day. The authors have modernized industry standard approaches to such predictive modeling by leveraging advanced data mining techniques. These techniques are more adept in detecting nonlinear response and accommodating interactions and automatically sifting through hundreds if not thousands of potential factors influencing sales outcomes. Results show that conventional statistical models miss a substantial fraction of the explainable variance while the new methods dominate in terms of performance and speed of model development. Accurate prediction is required for reliable planning and logistics, and optimization. Optimization with respect to pricing, promotion and assortment can be asked for relative to a variety of objectives (e.g. revenue, profits) and short term and long-term optimization may result in different decisions being taken. A unique challenge for retailers is the large number of constraints to which complex retail organizations are subject. Contracts and special understandings with valued suppliers severely constrain a retailer's flexibility. For example, certain products may not be promotable (or discounted) in isolation, and others (say from competitors) may not be promoted jointly, and the costs of goods sold may well depend on the quantities contracted. We discuss how we have resolved such challenges via a cycle of prediction and simulation to develop a flexible high-speed system for handling arbitrary constraints, arbitrary objectives, and achieve new levels of predictive accuracy and reliability.},

 abstract = {We describe a real-time bidding algorithm for performance-based display ad allocation. A central issue in performance display advertising is matching campaigns to ad impressions, which can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes revenue subject to constraints such as budget limits and inventory availability. The current practice is to solve the optimization problem offline at a tractable level of impression granularity (e.g., the page level), and to serve ads online based on the precomputed static delivery scheme. Although this offline approach takes a global view to achieve optimality, it fails to scale to ad allocation at the individual impression level. Therefore, we propose a real-time bidding algorithm that enables fine-grained impression valuation (e.g., targeting users with real-time conversion data), and adjusts value-based bids according to real-time constraint snapshots (e.g., budget consumption levels). Theoretically, we show that under a linear programming (LP) primal-dual formulation, the simple real-time bidding algorithm is indeed an online solver to the original primal problem by taking the optimal solution to the dual problem as input. In other words, the online algorithm guarantees the offline optimality given the same level of knowledge an offline optimization would have. Empirically, we develop and experiment with two real-time bid adjustment approaches to adapting to the non-stationary nature of the marketplace: one adjusts bids against real-time constraint satisfaction levels using control-theoretic methods, and the other adjusts bids also based on the statistically modeled historical bidding landscape. Finally, we show experimental results with real-world ad delivery data that support our theoretical conclusions.},

We develop techniques within this framework for classifying in an online setting, for example, for classifying the stream of web pages where online advertisements are being served. Stream applications present novel complications because (i) at the time of label acquisition, we don't know the set of instances that we will eventually see, (ii) instances repeat based on some unknown (and possibly skewed) distribution. We combine ideas from decision theory, cost-sensitive learning, and online density estimation. We also introduce a method for on-line estimation of the utility distribution, which allows us to manage the budget over the stream. The resulting model tells which instances to label so that by the end of each budget period, the budget is best spent (in expectation). The main results show that: (1) our proposed approach to active inference on streams can indeed reduce error costs substantially over alternative approaches, (2) more sophisticated online estimations achieve larger reductions in error. We next discuss simultaneously conducting active inference and active learning. We show that our expected-utility active inference strategy also selects good examples for learning. We close by pointing out that our utility-distribution estimation strategy can also be applied to convert pool-based active learning techniques into budget-sensitive online active learning techniques.},

 abstract = {The detection of outliers in spatio-temporal traffic data is an important research problem in the data mining and knowledge discovery community. However to the best of our knowledge, the discovery of relationships, especially causal interactions, among detected traffic outliers has not been investigated before. In this paper we propose algorithms which construct outlier causality trees based on temporal and spatial properties of detected outliers. Frequent substructures of these causality trees reveal not only recurring interactions among spatio-temporal outliers, but potential flaws in the design of existing traffic networks. The effectiveness and strength of our algorithms are validated by experiments on a very large volume of real taxi trajectories in an urban road network.},

 abstract = {Spatial analysis of disease risk, or disease mapping, typically relies on information about the residence and health status of individuals from population under study. However, residence information has its limitations because people are exposed to numerous disease risks as they spend time outside of their residences. Thanks to the wide-spread use of mobile phones and GPS-enabled devices, it is becoming possible to obtain a detailed record about the movement of human populations. Availability of movement information opens up an opportunity to improve the accuracy of disease mapping. Starting with an assumption that an individual's disease risk is a weighted average of risks at the locations which were visited, we show that disease mapping can be accomplished by spatially regularized logistic regression. Due to the inherent sparsity of movement data, the proposed approach can be applied to large populations and over large spatial grids. In our experiments, we were able to map disease for a simulated population with 1.6 million people and a spatial grid with 65 thousand locations in several minutes. The results indicate that movement information can improve the accuracy of disease mapping as compared to residential data only. We also studied a privacy-preserving scenario in which only the aggregate statistics are available about the movement of the overall population, while detailed movement information is available only for individuals with disease. The results indicate that the accuracy of disease mapping remains satisfactory when learning from movement data sanitized in this way.},

This becomes apparent, for example, in the context of email spam filtering, where an email service provider employs a spam filter and the spam sender can take this filter into account when generating new emails. We model the interaction between learner and data generator as a Stackelberg competition in which the learner plays the role of the leader and the data generator may react on the leader's move. We derive an optimization problem to determine the solution of this game and present several instances of the Stackelberg prediction game.

 abstract = {The KDD conference has seen remarkable growth since its origins as an IJCAI workshop in Detroit in 1989, evolving into a full-fledged research conference in 1995, underscoring the important role data mining as a field has played in extracting knowledge and actionable insights from vast troves of data that is being generated in the digital world around us. This year we received a record 755 submissions to the research program, from which 133 papers were accepted, for an aggregate acceptance rate of 17.6% (quite similar to recent years). Among the academic conferences, the KDD conference has typically more of an emphasis on research motivated by real-world applications. It is important to keep in mind that it is this synergy of research in areas like algorithms, computational geometry, database, graph theory, machine learning, natural language processing, statistics, visualization and many others when applied to problems arising in diverse fields such as web, medicine, climatology, marketing that drives our field forward, makes it vibrant and fun - who would know that ideas in computational geometry can be adapted to construct fast algorithms to improve online advertising and movie recommendations? The breadth of topics covered in this year's research program is truly comprehensive, including social networks, privacy, text mining, predictive modeling, time-series forecasting, spatial data analysis, geometry, and more. We are very fortunate to have 4 world-class keynote speakers this year spanning industry and academia, providing inspirational talks on cutting-edge techniques and issues in web mining, information networks, statistical inference for big data, and social computing. The process of whittling down the initial 734 submissions to the final set of 133 accepted papers required the coordination and time of a large number of willing volunteers. The program committee (PC) consisted of over 350 reviewers (PC members) and 50 senior PC members. In the first phase each submitted paper was automatically assigned to 3 reviewers (after a bidding process). Once the reviews from each of the 3 reviewers were completed, the program chairs rejected papers that did not receive much support from any of the reviewers. We rejected 259 papers at this stage. Special care was taken to minimize the error of rejecting a potentially good paper at this stage. The papers that survived the first phase were assigned to the senior PC members based on their bids, they had the option of initiating a discussion for any of their papers, e.g., if there was significant divergence in scores among reviewers, or if a paper was on the borderline of being accepted. Following the discussion phase, the senior PC members provided a recommendation score and a detailed meta-review for each paper. In the final phase, we (the program chairs) analyzed all of this information, starting with the obvious accept and reject decisions, and then gradually focusing in more detail on the papers near the borderline, seeking additional reviews and input from the PC and senior PC members where appropriate. We also initiated a shepherding phase with 15 papers having the opportunity of fixing mild issues we thought would be possible to address before they can be accepted. 13 of them were accepted after thorough revisions. Finally, it is quite likely that in hindsight some worthy papers may have been rejected as part of this process - these errors are an unfortunate reality of modern computer science conferences, and hard to avoid when a very large number of decisions have to be made over a short time span based on a subjective reviewing process. Nevertheless, we, the PC chairs, are responsible for those unfortunate errors and welcome suggestions on the matter.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a Cloud-based system computing customized and practically fast driving routes for an end user using (historical and real-time) traffic conditions and driver behavior. In this system, GPS-equipped taxicabs are employed as mobile sensors constantly probing the traffic rhythm of a city and taxi drivers' intelligence in choosing driving directions in the physical world. Meanwhile, a Cloud aggregates and mines the information from these taxis and other sources from the Internet, like Web maps and weather forecast. The Cloud builds a model incorporating day of the week, time of day, weather conditions, and individual driving strategies (both of the taxi drivers and of the end user for whom the route is being computed). Using this model, our system predicts the traffic conditions of a future time (when the computed route is actually driven) and performs a self-adaptive driving direction service for a particular user. This service gradually learns a user's driving behavior from the user's GPS logs and customizes the fastest route for the user with the help of the Cloud. We evaluate our service using a real-world dataset generated by over 33,000 taxis over a period of 3 months in Beijing. As a result, our service accurately estimates the travel time of a route for a user; hence finding the fastest route customized for the user.},

 abstract = {Given a very large moderate-to-high dimensionality dataset, how could one cluster its points? For datasets that don't fit even on a single disk, parallelism is a first class option. In this paper we explore MapReduce for clustering this kind of data. The main questions are (a) how to minimize the I/O cost, taking into account the already existing data partition (e.g., on disks), and (b) how to minimize the network cost among processing nodes. Either of them may be a bottleneck. Thus, we propose the Best of both Worlds -- BoW method, that automatically spots the bottleneck and chooses a good strategy. Our main contributions are: (1) We propose BoW and carefully derive its cost functions, which dynamically choose the best strategy; (2) We show that BoW has numerous desirable features: it can work with most serial clustering methods as a plugged-in clustering subroutine, it balances the cost for disk accesses and network accesses, achieving a very good tradeoff between the two, it uses no user-defined parameters (thanks to our reasonable defaults), it matches the clustering quality of the serial algorithm, and it has near-linear scale-up; and finally, (3) We report experiments on real and synthetic data with billions of points, using up to 1,024 cores in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, our Yahoo! web is the largest real dataset ever reported in the database subspace clustering literature. Spanning 0.2 TB of multi-dimensional data, it took only 8 minutes to be clustered, using 128 cores.},

 abstract = {We formalize the data mining process as a process of information exchange, defined by the following key components. The data miner's state of mind is modeled as a probability distribution, called the background distribution, which represents the uncertainty and misconceptions the data miner has about the data. This model initially incorporates any prior (possibly incorrect) beliefs a data miner has about the data. During the data mining process, properties of the data (to which we refer as patterns) are revealed to the data miner, either in batch, one by one, or even interactively. This acquisition of information in the data mining process is formalized by updates to the background distribution to account for the presence of the found patterns. The proposed framework can be motivated using concepts from information theory and game theory. Understanding it from this perspective, it is easy to see how it can be extended to more sophisticated settings, e.g. where patterns are probabilistic functions of the data (thus allowing one to account for noise and errors in the data mining process, and allowing one to study data mining techniques based on subsampling the data). The framework then models the data mining process using concepts from information geometry, and I-projections in particular. The framework can be used to help in designing new data mining algorithms that maximize the efficiency of the information exchange from the algorithm to the data miner.},

We focus on user reputation in a comment rating environment, where users make comments about content items and rate the comments of one another. Intuitively, a reputable user posts high quality comments and is highly rated by the user community. To our surprise, we find that the quality of a comment judged editorially is almost uncorrelated with the ratings that it receives, but can be predicted using standard text features, achieving accuracy as high as the agreement between two editors! However, extracting a pure reputation signal from ratings is difficult because of data sparseness and several confounding factors in users' voting behavior. To address these issues, we propose a novel bias-smoothed tensor model and empirically show that our model significantly outperforms a number of alternatives based on Yahoo! News, Yahoo!

 abstract = {In digital advertising, attribution is the problem of assigning credit to one or more advertisements for driving the user to the desirable actions such as making a purchase. Rather than giving all the credit to the last ad a user sees, multi-touch attribution allows more than one ads to get the credit based on their corresponding contributions. Multi-touch attribution is one of the most important problems in digital advertising, especially when multiple media channels, such as search, display, social, mobile and video are involved. Due to the lack of statistical framework and a viable modeling approach, true data-driven methodology does not exist today in the industry. While predictive modeling has been thoroughly researched in recent years in the digital advertising domain, the attribution problem focuses more on accurate and stable interpretation of the influence of each user interaction to the final user decision rather than just user classification. Traditional classification models fail to achieve those goals. In this paper, we first propose a bivariate metric, one measures the variability of the estimate, and the other measures the accuracy of classifying the positive and negative users. We then develop a bagged logistic regression model, which we show achieves a comparable classification accuracy as a usual logistic regression, but a much more stable estimate of individual advertising channel contributions. We also propose an intuitive and simple probabilistic model to directly quantify the attribution of different advertising channels. We then apply both the bagged logistic model and the probabilistic model to a real-world data set from a multi-channel advertising campaign for a well-known consumer software and services brand. The two models produce consistent general conclusions and thus offer useful cross-validation. The results of our attribution models also shed several important insights that have been validated by the advertising team. We have implemented the probabilistic model in the production advertising platform of the first author's company, and plan to implement the bagged logistic regression in the next product release. We believe availability of such data-driven multi-touch attribution metric and models is a break-through in the digital advertising industry.},

WorkiNet keeps the desirable structure of WordNet. At the same time, it captures abundant information from Wikipedia. We also propose a learning approach which is able to generate a tailor-made semantic concept collection for a given document collection. The learning process takes the characteristics of the given document collection into consideration and the semantic concepts in the tailor-made collection can be used as new features for document representation. The experimental results show that the adaptively generated feature space can outperform a static one significantly in text mining tasks, and WorkiNet dominates WordNet most of the time due to its high coverage.},

 abstract = {It has been recently recognized that heterogeneous information networks composed of multiple types of nodes and links are prevalent in the real world. Both classification and ranking of the nodes (or data objects) in such networks are essential for network analysis. However, so far these approaches have generally been performed separately. In this paper, we combine ranking and classification in order to perform more accurate analysis of a heterogeneous information network. Our intuition is that highly ranked objects within a class should play more important roles in classification. On the other hand, class membership information is important for determining a quality ranking over a dataset. We believe it is therefore beneficial to integrate classification and ranking in a simultaneous, mutually enhancing process, and to this end, propose a novel ranking-based iterative classification framework, called RankClass. Specifically, we build a graph-based ranking model to iteratively compute the ranking distribution of the objects within each class. At each iteration, according to the current ranking results, the graph structure used in the ranking algorithm is adjusted so that the sub-network corresponding to the specific class is emphasized, while the rest of the network is weakened. As our experiments show, integrating ranking with classification not only generates more accurate classes than the state-of-art classification methods on networked data, but also provides meaningful ranking of objects within each class, serving as a more informative view of the data than traditional classification.},

This year's KDD Conference continues its tradition of being the premier forum for the sharing of leading edge research results and industrial experiences of KDD theory, technology, and applications, among it's multi-disciplinary participants from academia, government, and industry. The KDD2011 organization committee has worked hard to help organize this year's conference, and to ensure that it maintains its pre-eminent position as the top worldwide conference for dissemination of cutting edge technical progress of this community. The science and business of extracting actionable insights from data has never been more important. We are experiencing an explosion of data, and the consequent interest in analyzing this information in a timely and rigorous fashion. Data and content volumes are expected to grow exponentially in the next decade. Much of the new growth is expected to dominantly come from unstructured content; documents, images, audio and video. These trends are setting up the stage for a fascinating set of new research challenges, and simultaneously driving the need for accelerated deployment of our research advances, ranging from algorithmic advances in core modeling and learning techniques, to scalable methods for parallel and distributed mining of massive scale data, to new paradigms for consumption and delivery of the analytic insights. It is my hope that attendees at this conference will be able to sense and appreciate the impressive progress our community is making in addressing these challenges. We have made a few changes this year to the traditional KDD conference format, to address the growing interest in this technology. The conference will begin as always with workshops and tutorials on Sunday, and then we have a full 3-day program for the main body of the conference. The extended 3-day main program has allowed us to include additional keynote plenary talks and make space for some exciting new content. We are launching a new track this year, called the Industry Practice Expo. The aim of the IPE track is to bring in eminent practitioners of KDD from industry to share with the participants their in depth experiences on what it means to successfully deploy working instances of high impacting KDD solutions.},

 abstract = {Data analysis is an inherently iterative process. That is, what we know about the data greatly determines our expectations, and hence, what result we would find the most interesting. With this in mind, we introduce a well-founded approach for succinctly summarizing data with a collection of itemsets; using a probabilistic maximum entropy model, we iteratively find the most interesting itemset, and in turn update our model of the data accordingly. As we only include itemsets that are surprising with regard to the current model, the summary is guaranteed to be both descriptive and non-redundant. The algorithm that we present can either mine the top-k most interesting itemsets, or use the Bayesian Information Criterion to automatically identify the model containing only the itemsets most important for describing the data. Or, in other words, it will 'tell you what you need to know'. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark data show that the discovered summaries are succinct, and correctly identify the key patterns in the data. The models they form attain high likelihoods, and inspection shows that they summarize the data well with increasingly specific, yet non-redundant itemsets.},

 abstract = {Several data mining algorithms use iterative optimization methods for learning predictive models. It is not easy to determine upfront which optimization method will perform best or converge fast for such tasks. In this paper, we analyze Meta Algorithms (MAs) which work by adaptively combining iterates from a pool of base optimization algorithms. We show that the performance of MAs are competitive with the best convex combination of the iterates from the base algorithms for online as well as batch convex optimization problems. We illustrate the effectiveness of MAs on the problem of portfolio selection in the stock market and use several existing ideas for portfolio selection as base algorithms. Using daily S\&P500 data for the past 21 years and a benchmark NYSE dataset, we show that MAs outperform existing portfolio selection algorithms with provable guarantees by several orders of magnitude, and match the performance of the best heuristics in the pool.},

 abstract = {Abstract Much of the world's electronic text is annotated with human-interpretable labels, such as tags on web pages and subject codes on academic publications. Effective text mining in this setting requires models that can flexibly account for the textual patterns that underlie the observed labels while still discovering unlabeled topics. Neither supervised classification, with its focus on label prediction, nor purely unsupervised learning, which does not model the labels explicitly, is appropriate. In this paper, we present two new partially supervised generative models of labeled text, Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA) and the Partially Labeled Dirichlet Process (PLDP). These models make use of the unsupervised learning machinery of topic models to discover the hidden topics within each label, as well as unlabeled, corpus-wide latent topics. We explore applications with qualitative case studies of tagged web pages from del.icio.us and PhD dissertation abstracts, demonstrating improved model interpretability over traditional topic models. We use the many tags present in our del.icio.us dataset to quantitatively demonstrate the new models' higher correlation with human relatedness scores over several strong baselines.},

 abstract = {Text corpora with documents from a range of time epochs are natural and ubiquitous in many fields, such as research papers, newspaper articles and a variety of types of recently emerged social media. People not only would like to know what kind of topics can be found from these data sources but also wish to understand the temporal dynamics of these topics and predict certain properties of terms or documents in the future. Topic models are usually utilized to find latent topics from text collections, and recently have been applied to temporal text corpora. However, most proposed models are general purpose models to which no real tasks are explicitly associated. Therefore, current models may be difficult to apply in real-world applications, such as the problems of tracking trends and predicting popularity of keywords. In this paper, we introduce a real-world task, tracking trends of terms, to which temporal topic models can be applied. Rather than building a general-purpose model, we propose a new type of topic model that incorporates the volume of terms into the temporal dynamics of topics and optimizes estimates of term volumes. In existing models, trends are either latent variables or not considered at all which limits the potential for practical use of trend information. In contrast, we combine state-space models with term volumes with a supervised learning model, enabling us to effectively predict the volume in the future, even without new documents. In addition, it is straightforward to obtain the volume of latent topics as a by-product of our model, demonstrating the superiority of utilizing temporal topic models over traditional time-series tools (e.g., autoregressive models) to tackle this kind of problem. The proposed model can be further extended with arbitrary word-level features which are evolving over time. We present the results of applying the model to two datasets with long time periods and show its effectiveness over non-trivial baselines.},

Mapping these phenotypes to pairs of genetic loci is hindered by the huge number of candidates leading to enormous computational and statistical problems. In GWAS on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one has to consider in the order of 1010 to 1014 pairs, which is infeasible in practice. In this article, we give the first algorithm for 2-locus genome-wide association studies that is subquadratic in the number, n, of SNPs. The running time of our algorithm is data-dependent, but large experiments over real genomic data suggest that it scales empirically as n3/2. As a result, our algorithm can easily cope with n ~ 107, i.e., it can efficiently search all pairs of SNPs in the human genome.},

They can be used as an alternative to exhaustive local pattern discovery methods (e.g, frequent set mining or optimistic-estimator-based subgroup discovery) and can substantially improve efficiency as well as controllability of pattern discovery processes. While previous sampling approaches mainly rely on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, our procedures are direct, i.e., non process-simulating, sampling algorithms. The advantages of these direct methods are an almost optimal time complexity per pattern as well as an exactly controlled distribution of the produced patterns. Namely, the proposed algorithms can sample (item-)sets according to frequency, area, squared frequency, and a class discriminativity measure. Experiments demonstrate that these procedures can improve the accuracy of pattern-based models similar to frequent sets and often also lead to substantial gains in terms of scalability.},

Our algorithm is called Active Vote, and it works by actively selecting instances that force several perturbed copies of an on-line algorithm to make mistakes. The main intuition for our result is based on the fact that the number of mistakes made by the optimal on-line algorithm is a lower bound on the number of labels needed for active learning. We provide performance bounds for Active Vote in both a batch and on-line model of active learning. These performance bounds depend on the algorithm having a set of unlabeled instances in which the various perturbed on-line algorithms disagree. The motivating application for Active Vote is an Internet advertisement rating program. We conduct experiments using data collected for this advertisement problem along with experiments using standard datasets. We show Active Vote can achieve an order of magnitude decrease in the number of labeled instances over various passive learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines.},

 abstract = {Time series shapelets are small, local patterns in a time series that are highly predictive of a class and are thus very useful features for building classifiers and for certain visualization and summarization tasks. While shapelets were introduced only recently, they have already seen significant adoption and extension in the community. Despite their immense potential as a data mining primitive, there are two important limitations of shapelets. First, their expressiveness is limited to simple binary presence/absence questions. Second, even though shapelets are computed offline, the time taken to compute them is significant. In this work, we address the latter problem by introducing a novel algorithm that finds shapelets in less time than current methods by an order of magnitude. Our algorithm is based on intelligent caching and reuse of computations, and the admissible pruning of the search space. Because our algorithm is so fast, it creates an opportunity to consider more expressive shapelet queries. In particular, we show for the first time an augmented shapelet representation that distinguishes the data based on conjunctions or disjunctions of shapelets. We call our novel representation Logical-Shapelets. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on the classic benchmark datasets used for these problems, and show several case studies where logical shapelets significantly outperform the original shapelet representation and other time series classification techniques. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas in domains as diverse as gesture recognition, robotics, and biometrics.},

 abstract = {Many practical data mining systems such as those for fraud detection and surveillance deal with building classifiers that are not autonomous but part of a larger interactive system with an expert in the loop. The goal of these systems is not just to maximize the performance of the classifier but to make the experts more efficient at performing their task, thus maximizing the overall Return on Investment of the system. This paper describes an interactive system for detecting payment errors in insurance claims with claim auditors in the loop. We describe an interactive claims prioritization component that uses an online cost-sensitive learning approach (more-like-this) to make the system efficient. Our interactive prioritization component is built on top of a batch classifier that has been trained to detect payment errors in health insurance claims and optimizes the interaction between the classifier and the domain experts who are consuming the results of this system. The goal is to make these auditors more efficient and effective as well as improving the classification performance of the system. The result is both a reduction in time it takes for the auditors to review and label claims as well as improving the precision of the system in finding payment errors. We show results obtained from applying this system at two major US health insurance companies indicating significant reduction in claim audit costs and potential savings of $20-$26 million/year making the insurance providers more efficient and lowering their operating costs. Our system reduces the money being wasted by providers and insurers dealing with incorrectly processed claims and makes the healthcare system more efficient.},

 abstract = {With the development of Web applications, textual documents are not only getting richer, but also ubiquitously interconnected with users and other objects in various ways, which brings about text-rich heterogeneous information networks. Topic models have been proposed and shown to be useful for document analysis, and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics of the network. However, most of topic models only consider the textual information while ignore the network structures or can merely integrate with homogeneous networks. None of them can handle heterogeneous information network well. In this paper, we propose a novel topic model with biased propagation (TMBP) algorithm to directly incorporate heterogeneous information network with topic modeling in a unified way. The underlying intuition is that multi-typed objects should be treated differently along with their inherent textual information and the rich semantics of the heterogeneous information network. A simple and unbiased topic propagation across such a heterogeneous network does not make much sense. Consequently, we investigate and develop two biased propagation frameworks, the biased random walk framework and the biased regularization framework, for the TMBP algorithm from different perspectives, which can discover latent topics and identify clusters of multi-typed objects simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach and compare to the state-of-the-art techniques on several datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the improvement in our proposed approach is consistent and promising.},

 abstract = {As the size of data sets used to build classifiers steadily increases, training a linear model efficiently with limited memory becomes essential. Several techniques deal with this problem by loading blocks of data from disk one at a time, but usually take a considerable number of iterations to converge to a reasonable model. Even the best block minimization techniques [1] require many block loads since they treat all training examples uniformly. As disk I/O is expensive, reducing the amount of disk access can dramatically decrease the training time. This paper introduces a selective block minimization (SBM) algorithm, a block minimization method that makes use of selective sampling. At each step, SBM updates the model using data consisting of two parts: (1) new data loaded from disk and (2) a set of informative samples already in memory from previous steps. We prove that, by updating the linear model in the dual form, the proposed method fully utilizes the data in memory and converges to a globally optimal solution on the entire data. Experiments show that the SBM algorithm dramatically reduces the number of blocks loaded from disk and consequently obtains an accurate and stable model quickly on both binary and multi-class classification.},

 abstract = {A major source of revenue shrink in retail stores is the intentional or unintentional failure of proper checking out of items by the cashier. More recently, a few automated surveillance systems have been developed to monitor cashier lanes and detect non-compliant activities such as fake item checkouts or scans done with the intention of deriving monetary benefit. These systems use data from surveillance video cameras and transaction logs (TLog) recorded at the Point-of-Sale (POS). In this paper, we present a pattern discovery based approach to detect fraudulent events at the POS. Our approach is based on mining time-ordered text streams, representing retail transactions, formed from a combination of visually detected checkout related activities called primitives and barcodes from TLog data. Patterns representing single item checkouts, i.e. anchored around a single barcode, are discovered from these text streams using an efficient pattern discovery technique called Teiresias. The discovered patterns are used to build models for true and fake item scans by retaining or discarding the anchoring barcodes in those patterns respectively. A pattern matching and classification scheme is designed to robustly detect non-compliant cashier activities in the presence of noise in either the TLog or the video data. Different weighting schemes for quantifying the relative importance of the discovered patterns are explored: Frequency, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Frequency+SVM. Using a large scale dataset recorded from retail stores, our approach discovers semantically meaningful cashier scan patterns. Our experiments also suggest that different weighting schemes result in varied false and true positive performances on the task of fake scan detection.},

 abstract = {In domains such as consumer products or manufacturing amongst others, we have problems that warrant the prediction of a continuous target. Besides the usual set of explanatory attributes we may also have exact (or approximate) estimates of aggregated targets, which are the sums of disjoint sets of individual targets that we are trying to predict. Hence, the question now becomes can we use these aggregated targets, which are a coarser piece of information, to improve the quality of predictions of the individual targets? In this paper, we provide a simple yet provable way of accomplishing this. In particular, given predictions from any regression model of the target on the test data, we elucidate a provable method for improving these predictions in terms of mean squared error, given exact (or accurate enough) information of the aggregated targets. These estimates of the aggregated targets may be readily available or obtained -- through multilevel regression -- at different levels of granularity. Based on the proof of our method we suggest a criterion for choosing the appropriate level. Moreover, in addition to estimates of the aggregated targets, if we have exact (or approximate) estimates of the mean and variance of the target distribution, then based on our general strategy we provide an optimal way of incorporating this information so as to further improve the quality of predictions of the individual targets. We then validate the results and our claims by conducting experiments on synthetic and real industrial data obtained from diverse domains.},

This question is largely unexplored, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale society-wide data that simultaneously capture the dynamical information on individual movements and social interactions. Here we address this challenge for the first time by tracking the trajectories and communication records of 6 Million mobile phone users. We find that the similarity between two individuals' movements strongly correlates with their proximity in the social network. We further investigate how the predictive power hidden in such correlations can be exploited to address a challenging problem: which new links will develop in a social network. We show that mobility measures alone yield surprising predictive power, comparable to traditional network-based measures. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy can be significantly improved by learning a supervised classifier based on combined mobility and network measures. We believe our findings on the interplay of mobility patterns and social ties offer new perspectives on not only link prediction but also network dynamics.},

 abstract = {Over the last decade great strides have been made in developing techniques to compute functions privately. In particular, Differential Privacy gives strong promises about conclusions that can be drawn about an individual. In contrast, various syntactic methods for providing privacy (criteria such as k-anonymity and l-diversity) have been criticized for still allowing private information of an individual to be inferred. In this paper, we consider the ability of an attacker to use data meeting privacy definitions to build an accurate classifier. We demonstrate that even under Differential Privacy, such classifiers can be used to infer "private" attributes accurately in realistic data. We compare this to similar approaches for inference-based attacks on other forms of anonymized data. We show how the efficacy of all these attacks can be measured on the same scale, based on the probability of successfully inferring a private attribute. We observe that the accuracy of inference of private attributes for differentially private data and $l$-diverse data can be quite similar.},

 abstract = {We present a framework for discriminative sequence classification where linear classifiers work directly in the explicit high-dimensional predictor space of all subsequences in the training set (as opposed to kernel-induced spaces). This is made feasible by employing a gradient-bounded coordinate-descent algorithm for efficiently selecting discriminative subsequences without having to expand the whole space. Our framework can be applied to a wide range of loss functions, including binomial log-likelihood loss of logistic regression and squared hinge loss of support vector machines. When applied to protein remote homology detection and remote fold recognition, our framework achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art (e.g., kernel support vector machines). In contrast to state-of-the-art sequence classifiers, our models are simply lists of weighted discriminative subsequences and can thus be interpreted and related to the biological problem -- a crucial requirement for the bioinformatics and medical communities.},

Our interest is in the temporal history of event codes embedded in patients' records, specifically investigating frequently occurring sequences of event codes across patients. In studying data from more than 1.6 million patient histories at the University of Michigan Health system we quickly realized that frequent sequences, while providing one level of data reduction, still constitute a serious analytical challenge as many involve alternate serializations of the same sets of codes. To further analyze these sequences, we designed an approach where a partial order is mined from frequent sequences of codes. We demonstrate an EMR mining system called EMRView that enables exploration of the precedence relationships to quickly identify and visualize partial order information encoded in key classes of patients. We demonstrate some important nuggets learned through our approach and also outline key challenges for future research based on our experiences.},

Given the importance of insects in human affairs, it is somewhat surprising that computer science has not had a larger impact in entomology. We believe that recent advances in sensor technology are beginning change this, and a new field of Computational Entomology will emerge.

 abstract = {Display advertising has been a significant source of revenue for publishers and ad networks in online advertising ecosystem. One important business model in online display advertising is Ad Exchange marketplace, also called non-guaranteed delivery (NGD), in which advertisers buy targeted page views and audiences on a spot market through real-time auction. In this paper, we describe a bid landscape forecasting system in NGD marketplace for any advertiser campaign specified by a variety of targeting attributes. In the system, the impressions that satisfy the campaign targeting attributes are partitioned into multiple mutually exclusive samples. Each sample is one unique combination of quantified attribute values. We develop a divide-and-conquer approach that breaks down the campaign-level forecasting problem. First, utilizing a novel star-tree data structure, we forecast the bid for each sample using non-linear regression by gradient boosting decision trees. Then we employ a mixture-of-log-normal model to generate campaign-level bid distribution based on the sample-level forecasted distributions. The experiment results of a system developed with our approach show that it can accurately forecast the bid distributions for various campaigns running on the world's largest NGD advertising exchange system, outperforming two baseline methods in term of forecasting errors.},

While many algorithms have been introduced that tackle the problem of clustering on evolving data streams, hardly any attention has been paid to appropriate evaluation measures. Measures developed for static scenarios, namely structural measures and ground-truth-based measures, cannot correctly reflect errors attributable to emerging, splitting, or moving clusters. These situations are inherent to the streaming context due to the dynamic changes in the data distribution. In this paper we develop a novel evaluation measure for stream clustering called Cluster Mapping Measure (CMM). CMM effectively indicates different types of errors by taking the important properties of evolving data streams into account. We show in extensive experiments on real and synthetic data that CMM is a robust measure for stream clustering evaluation.},

 abstract = {KDD-2010, the 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, is being held in Washington, DC, USA, on July 24--28, 2010. KDD is the leading international forum for the exchange of research results and practical experience in the field of knowledge discovery and data mining. As the quantity of data available to organizations and individuals continues to grow rapidly, and the need to extract useful knowledge from them becomes more intense, scientists, government workers and business people turn to the KDD community for solutions. This volume contains a snapshot of a year of developments in this field; we hope you will find it useful and rewarding. The KDD-2010 technical program features four parallel research tracks and an industrial / government track. The program also features keynotes from leading creators and consumers of KDD technology, 12 workshops, 12 tutorials and one panel. The 2010 KDD Cup competition focuses on educational data mining to support improvements in the field of computer aided instruction. Dozens of technical demonstrations and exhibits from vendors and other organizations underscore the conference's dual role as the leading industry and academic forum to discuss the advances in this field of research. The call for papers attracted 578 research papers and 101 industrial and government submissions from around the world. Each paper was independently reviewed by three members of the program committee for originality, significance, technical quality, and clarity of presentation. This year's research track introduced an author-feedback phase in the review process, in which authors were invited to comment on the preliminary reviews that they received. The objective of the feedback phase is to ensure greater transparency and fairness, as the authors' responses are taken into account in a subsequent discussion phase moderated by Senior Program Committee (SPC) members. There was much discussion among the reviewers in the subsequent discussion phase before the final decisions. In the end, the program committee accepted 77 papers for long presentations and 24 papers for short presentations into the research track, representing an aggregated acceptance rate of 17.4%. This year's Industry and Government track emphasized the successful uses of KDD technology, including deployed applications incorporating KDD technologies and discoveries of valid, novel, understandable, and demonstrably useful patterns from large datasets in industry and government, as well as emerging applications and technology, including challenges and issues arising from attempts to deploy KDD technology to solve specific industry or government problems. The industry and government track of the conference accepted 11 papers for long presentations and 9 papers for short presentations into the program, representing an aggregated acceptance rate of 19.8%. We are glad to see that the conference remains strongly competitive and of very high quality. The resulting program was notable for its diversity and vitality. Alongside traditional KDD topics like classification, clustering, frequent sets, and temporal data, we also saw papers in rapidly growing areas like social network and graph mining, privacy, recommendation, ranking, topic modeling and transfer learning. Application areas included the Web, bio-informatics, mobility data, healthcare, marketing, and many others.},

Indeed, a key challenge along this line is how to align the right information with the right people. For a long time, people have made tremendous efforts in establishing credit records for the borrowers. However, information from investors is still under-explored for improving investment decisions in P2P lending. To that end, we propose a data driven investment decision-making framework, which exploits the investor composition of each investment for enhancing decisions making in P2P lending. Specifically, we first build investor profiles based on quantitative analysis of past performances, risk preferences, and investment experiences of investors. Then, based on investor profiles, we develop an investor composition analysis model, which can be used to select valuable investments and improve the investment decisions. To validate the proposed model, we perform extensive experiments on the real-world data from the world's largest P2P lending marketplace. Experimental results reveal that investor composition can help us evaluate the profit potential of an investment and the decision model based on investor composition can help investors make better investment decisions.},

 abstract = {As botnets continue to proliferate and grow in sophistication, so does the need for more advanced security solutions to effectively detect and defend against such attacks. In particular, botnets such as Conficker have been known to encrypt the communication packets exchanged between bots and their command-and-control server, making it costly for existing botnet detection systems that rely on deep packet inspection (DPI) methods to identify compromised machines. In this paper, we argue that, even in the face of encrypted traffic flows, botnets can still be detected by examining the set of server IP-addresses visited by a client machine in the past. However there are several challenges that must be addressed. First, the set of server IP-addresses visited by client machines may evolve dynamically. Second, the set of client machines used for training and their class labels may also change over time. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a novel incremental LS-SVM algorithm that is adaptive to both changes in the feature set and class labels of training instances. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we have performed experiments on two large-scale datasets, including real-time data collected from peering routers at a large Tier-1 ISP. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm produces classification accuracy comparable to its batch counterpart, while consuming significantly less computational resources.},

@inproceedings{Kashyap:2011:SKS:2020408.2020607,
 abstract = {Nearest-neighbor search over time series has received vast research attention as a basic data mining task. Still, none of the hitherto proposed methods scales well with increasing time-series length. This is due to the fact that all methods provide an one-off pruning capacity only. In particular, traditional methods utilize an index to search in a reduced-dimensionality feature space; however, for high time-series length, search with such an index yields many false hits that need to be eliminated by accessing the full records. An attempt to reduce false hits by indexing more features exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, and vice versa. A recently proposed alternative, iSAX, uses symbolic approximate representations accessed by a simple file-system directory as an index. Still, iSAX also encounters false hits, which are again eliminated by accessing records in full: once a false hit is generated by the index, there is no second chance to prune it; thus, the pruning capacity iSAX provides is also one-off. This paper proposes an alternative approach to time series kNN search, following a nontraditional pruning style. Instead of navigating through candidate records via an index, we access their features, obtained by a multi-resolution transform, in a stepwise sequential-scan manner, one level of resolution at a time, over a vertical representation. Most candidates are progressively eliminated after a few of their terms are accessed, using pre-computed information and an unprecedentedly tight double-bounding scheme, involving not only lower, but also upper distance bounds. Our experimental study with large, high-length time-series data confirms the advantage of our approach over both the current state-of-the-art method, iSAX, and classical index-based methods.},

 abstract = {The improvement of Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery techniques are national priorities in the wake of man-made and nature inflicted calamities of the last decade. Our prior work has demonstrated that the efficiency of sharing and managing information plays an important role in business recovery efforts after disaster event. With the proliferation of smart phones and wireless tablets, professionals who have an operational responsibility in disaster situations are relying on such devices to maintain communication. Further, with the rise of social media, technology savvy consumers are also using these devices extensively for situational updates. In this paper, we address several critical tasks which can facilitate information sharing and collaboration between both private and public sector participants for major disaster recovery planning and management. We design and implement an All-Hazard Disaster Situation Browser (ADSB) system that runs on Apple's mobile operating system (iOS) and iPhone and iPad mobile devices. Our proposed techniques create a collaborative solution on a mobile platform using advanced data mining and information retrieval techniques for disaster preparedness and recovery that helps impacted communities better understand the current disaster situation and how the community is recovering. Specifically, hierarchical summarization techniques are used to generate brief reviews from a large collection of reports at different granularities; probabilistic models are proposed to dynamically generate query forms based on user's feedback; and recommendation techniques are adapted to help users identify potential contacts for report sharing and community organization. Furthermore, the developed techniques are designed to be all-hazard capable so that they can be used in earthquake, terrorism, or other unanticipated disaster situations.},

 abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a severe neurodegenerative disorder. Identifying markers that can track the progress of the disease has recently received increasing attentions in AD research. A definitive diagnosis of AD requires autopsy confirmation, thus many clinical/cognitive measures including Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) have been designed to evaluate the cognitive status of the patients and used as important criteria for clinical diagnosis of probable AD. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning formulation for predicting the disease progression measured by the cognitive scores and selecting markers predictive of the progression. Specifically, we formulate the prediction problem as a multi-task regression problem by considering the prediction at each time point as a task. We capture the intrinsic relatedness among different tasks by a temporal group Lasso regularizer. The regularizer consists of two components including an L2,1-norm penalty on the regression weight vectors, which ensures that a small subset of features will be selected for the regression models at all time points, and a temporal smoothness term which ensures a small deviation between two regression models at successive time points. We have performed extensive evaluations using various types of data at the baseline from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database for predicting the future MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores. Our experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for capturing the progression trend and the cross-sectional group differences of AD severity. Results also show that most markers selected by the proposed algorithm are consistent with findings from existing cross-sectional studies.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have suggested using relative distance comparisons as constraints to represent domain knowledge. A natural extension to relative comparisons is the combination of two comparisons defined on the same set of three instances. Constraints in this form, termed Relative Constraints, provide a unified knowledge representation for both partitional and hierarchical clusterings. But many key properties of relative constraints remain unknown. In this paper, we answer the following important questions that enable the broader application of relative constraints in general clustering problems: " Feasibility: Does there exist a clustering that satisfies a given set of relative constraints? (consistency of constraints) "Completeness: Given a set of consistent relative constraints, how can one derive a complete clustering without running into dead-ends? " Informativeness: How can one extract the most informative relative constraints from given knowledge sources? We show that any hierarchical domain knowledge can be easily represented by relative constraints. We further present a hierarchical algorithm that finds a clustering satisfying all given constraints in polynomial time. Experiments showed that our algorithm achieves significantly higher accuracy than the existing metric learning approach based on relative comparisons.},

 abstract = {We provide a novel algorithm to approximately factor large matrices with millions of rows, millions of columns, and billions of nonzero elements. Our approach rests on stochastic gradient descent (SGD), an iterative stochastic optimization algorithm. We first develop a novel "stratified" SGD variant (SSGD) that applies to general loss-minimization problems in which the loss function can be expressed as a weighted sum of "stratum losses." We establish sufficient conditions for convergence of SSGD using results from stochastic approximation theory and regenerative process theory. We then specialize SSGD to obtain a new matrix-factorization algorithm, called DSGD, that can be fully distributed and run on web-scale datasets using, e.g., MapReduce. DSGD can handle a wide variety of matrix factorizations. We describe the practical techniques used to optimize performance in our DSGD implementation. Experiments suggest that DSGD converges significantly faster and has better scalability properties than alternative algorithms.},

 abstract = {With the coming of age of web as a mainstream customer service channel, B2C companies have invested substantial resources in enhancing their web presence. Today customers can interact with a company through channels such as phone, chat, email, social media or web self-service. With the availability of web logs, CRM data and text transcripts these online channels are rich with data and they track several aspects of customer behavior and intent. 24/7 Customer Innovation Labs has developed a series of data mining and statistics driven solutions to improve customer experience in each of these online channels. This talk will focus on solutions to enhance performance of web chat as a customer service channel. 2 stages of customer life-cycle will be considered -- new customer acquisition (or sales) and service of existing customers. In customer acquisition the key objective is to maximize "incremental" revenues via chat. While in customer service the objective is to drive up the quality of customer experience (measured by customer satisfaction surveys or mined customer sentiments) through chat. The solution based on machine learning methods involves: Real-time targeting of the right visitors to chat Predicting customer needs Routing customer to the right customer service agent Mining chat transcripts and Social Media Portals to identify key customer issues and customer sentiments Mining agents' responses for performance improvement Feeding back learning from 4 and 5 to 1 (better targeting) Real-life case studies will be presented to show how that this closed loop solution can quickly improve key metrics.},

 abstract = {Existing fact-finding models assume availability of structured data or accurate information extraction. However, as online data gets more unstructured, these assumptions are no longer valid. To overcome this, we propose a novel, content-based, trust propagation framework that relies on signals from the textual content to ascertain veracity of free-text claims and compute trustworthiness of their sources. We incorporate the quality of relevant content into the framework and present an iterative algorithm for propagation of trust scores. We show that existing fact finders on structured data can be modeled as specific instances of this framework. Using a retrieval-based approach to find relevant articles, we instantiate the framework to compute trustworthiness of news sources and articles. We show that the proposed framework helps ascertain trustworthiness of sources better. We also show that ranking news articles based on trustworthiness learned from the content-driven framework is significantly better than baselines that ignore either the content quality or the trust framework.},

 abstract = {We present a document classification system that employs lazy learning from labeled phrases, and argue that the system can be highly effective whenever the following property holds: most of information on document labels is captured in phrases. We call this property near sufficiency. Our research contribution is twofold: (a) we quantify the near sufficiency property using the Information Bottleneck principle and show that it is easy to check on a given dataset; (b) we reveal that in all practical cases---from small-scale to very large-scale---manual labeling of phrases is feasible: the natural language constrains the number of common phrases composed of a vocabulary to grow linearly with the size of the vocabulary. Both these contributions provide firm foundation to applicability of the phrase-based classification (PBC) framework to a variety of large-scale tasks. We deployed the PBC system on the task of job title classification, as a part of LinkedIn's data standardization effort. The system significantly outperforms its predecessor both in terms of precision and coverage. It is currently being used in LinkedIn's ad targeting product, and more applications are being developed. We argue that PBC excels in high explainability of the classification results, as well as in low development and low maintenance costs. We benchmark PBC against existing high-precision document classification algorithms and conclude that it is most useful in multilabel classification.},

We claim however that its user experience could be significantly improved if it could route the "right question" to the "right user." Indeed, while some users would rush answering a question such as "what should I wear at the prom?," others would be upset simply being exposed to it. We argue here that Community Question Answering sites in general and Yahoo! Answers in particular, need a mechanism that would expose users to questions they can relate to and possibly answer. We propose here to address this need via a multi-channel recommender system technology for associating questions with potential answerers on Yahoo! Answers. One novel aspect of our approach is exploiting a wide variety of content and social signals users regularly provide to the system and organizing them into channels. Content signals relate mostly to the text and categories of questions and associated answers, while social signals capture the various user interactions with questions, such as asking, answering, voting, etc. We fuse and generalize known recommendation approaches within a single symmetric framework, which incorporates and properly balances multiple types of signals according to channels. Tested on a large scale dataset, our model exhibits good performance, clearly outperforming standard baselines.},

 abstract = {Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an effective dimension reduction method for non-negative dyadic data, and has proven to be useful in many areas, such as text mining, bioinformatics and image processing. NMF is usually formulated as a constrained non-convex optimization problem, and many algorithms have been developed for solving it. Recently, a coordinate descent method, called FastHals, has been proposed to solve least squares NMF and is regarded as one of the state-of-the-art techniques for the problem. In this paper, we first show that FastHals has an inefficiency in that it uses a cyclic coordinate descent scheme and thus, performs unneeded descent steps on unimportant variables. We then present a variable selection scheme that uses the gradient of the objective function to arrive at a new coordinate descent method. Our new method is considerably faster in practice and we show that it has theoretical convergence guarantees. Moreover when the solution is sparse, as is often the case in real applications, our new method benefits by selecting important variables to update more often, thus resulting in higher speed. As an example, on a text dataset RCV1, our method is 7 times faster than FastHals, and more than 15 times faster when the sparsity is increased by adding an L1 penalty. We also develop new coordinate descent methods when error in NMF is measured by KL-divergence by applying the Newton method to solve the one-variable sub-problems. Experiments indicate that our algorithm for minimizing the KL-divergence is faster than the Lee & Seung multiplicative rule by a factor of 10 on the CBCL image dataset.},

 abstract = {We propose to compress weighted graphs (networks), motivated by the observation that large networks of social, biological, or other relations can be complex to handle and visualize. In the process also known as graph simplification, nodes and (unweighted) edges are grouped to supernodes and superedges, respectively, to obtain a smaller graph. We propose models and algorithms for weighted graphs. The interpretation (i.e. decompression) of a compressed, weighted graph is that a pair of original nodes is connected by an edge if their supernodes are connected by one, and that the weight of an edge is approximated to be the weight of the superedge. The compression problem now consists of choosing supernodes, superedges, and superedge weights so that the approximation error is minimized while the amount of compression is maximized. In this paper, we formulate this task as the 'simple weighted graph compression problem'. We then propose a much wider class of tasks under the name of 'generalized weighted graph compression problem'. The generalized task extends the optimization to preserve longer-range connectivities between nodes, not just individual edge weights. We study the properties of these problems and propose a range of algorithms to solve them, with different balances between complexity and quality of the result. We evaluate the problems and algorithms experimentally on real networks. The results indicate that weighted graphs can be compressed efficiently with relatively little compression error.},

MLNs allow us to model a wide range of rich structural features like proximity, precedence, alignment, and contiguity, using first-order clauses. We show that inference in our information extraction scenario reduces to solving an instance of the maximum weight subgraph problem. We develop specialized procedures for solving the maximum subgraph variants that are far more efficient than previously proposed inference methods for MLNs that solve variants of MAX-SAT.

However, for several relevant applications this type of forecasts has limited utility (e.g. costumer wallet value estimation, wind and electricity power production, control of water quality, etc.). For these domains it is frequently more important to be able to forecast a range of plausible future values of the target variable. A typical example is wind power production, where it is of high relevance to predict the future wind variability in order to ensure that supply and demand are balanced. This type of predictions will allow timely actions to be taken in order to cope with the expected values of the target variable on a certain future time horizon. In this paper we study this type of predictions - the prediction of a range of expected values for a future time interval. We describe some possible approaches to this task and propose an alternative procedure that our extensive experiments on both artificial and real world domains show to have clear advantages.},

However, many clustering algorithms designed to handle large data sets assume linear separability of data and hence do not perform well on real world data sets. While kernel-based clustering algorithms can capture the non-linear structure in data, they do not scale well in terms of speed and memory requirements when the number of objects to be clustered exceeds tens of thousands. We propose an approximation scheme for kernel k-means, termed approximate kernel k-means, that reduces both the computational complexity and the memory requirements by employing a randomized approach.

 abstract = {Associative classification is a predictive modeling technique that constructs a classifier based on class association rules (also known as predictive association rules; PARs). PARs are association rules where the consequence of the rule is a class label. Associative classification has gained substantial research attention because it successfully joins the benefits of association rule mining with classification. These benefits include the inherent ability of association rule mining to extract high-order interactions among the predictors--an ability that many modern classifiers lack--and also the natural interpretability of the individual PARs. Associative classification is not without its caveats. Association rule mining often discovers a combinatorially large number of association rules, eroding the interpretability of the rule set. Extensive effort has been directed towards developing interestingness measures, which filter (predictive) association rules after they have been generated. These interestingness measures, albeit very successful at selecting interesting rules, lack two features that are highly valuable in the context of classification. First, only few of the interestingness measures are rooted in a statistical model. Given the distinction between a training and a test data set in the classification setting, the ability to make statistical inferences about the performance of the predictive classification rules on the test set is highly desirable. Second, the unfiltered set of predictive assocation rules (PARs) are often redundant, we can prove that certain PARs will not be used to construct a classification model given the presence of other PARs. In this paper, we propose a simple statistical model towards making inferences on the test set about the various performance metrics of predictive association rules. We also derive three filtering criteria based on hypothesis testing, which are very selective (reduce the number of PARs to be considered by the classifier by several orders of magnitude), yet do not effect the performance of the classification adversely. In the case, where the classification model is constructed as a logistic model on top of the PARs, we can mathematically prove, that the filtering criteria do not significantly effect the classifier's performance. We also demonstrate empirically on three publicly available data sets that the vast reduction in the number of PARs indeed did not come at the cost of reducing the predictive performance.},

 abstract = {We consider the characterization of muscle fatigue through noninvasive sensing mechanism such as surface electromyography (SEMG). While changes in the properties of SEMG signals with respect to muscle fatigue have been reported in the literature, the large variation in these signals across different individuals makes the task of modeling and classification of SEMG signals challenging. Indeed, the variation in SEMG parameters from subject to subject creates differences in the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework based on the multi-source domain adaptation methodology for detecting different stages of fatigue using SEMG signals, that addresses the distribution differences. In the proposed framework, the SEMG data of a subject represent a domain; data from multiple subjects in the training set form the multiple source domains and the test subject data form the target domain. SEMG signals are predominantly different in conditional probability distribution across subjects. The key feature of the proposed framework is a novel weighting scheme that addresses the conditional probability distribution differences across multiple domains (subjects). We have validated the proposed framework on Surface Electromyogram signals collected from 8 people during a fatigue-causing repetitive gripping activity. Comprehensive experiments on the SEMG data set demonstrate that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 20% to 30% over the cases without any domain adaptation method and by 13% to 30% over the existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.},

'Like' has now become a very popular social function by allowing users to express their like of certain objects. It provides an accurate way of estimating user interests and an effective way of sharing/promoting information in social media. In this demo, we propose a system called LikeMiner to mine the power of 'like' in social media networks. We introduce a heterogeneous network model for social media with 'likes', and propose 'like' mining algorithms to estimate representativeness and influence of objects.

Most traditional active learning methods pose a very specific query to the oracle, i.e. they ask for the label of an unlabeled example. This paper proposes a novel active learning method called RIQY (Rule Induced active learning QuerY). It can construct generic active learning queries based on rule induction from multiple unlabeled instances. These queries are shorter and more readable for the oracle and encompass many similar cases. Also the learning algorithm can achieve higher accuracy rates by asking fewer queries. We evaluate our algorithm on 12 different real datasets. Our results show that we can achieve higher accuracy rates using fewer queries compared to the traditional active learning methods.},

 abstract = {Efficient thermal management is important in modern data centers as cooling consumes up to 50% of the total energy. Unlike previous work, we consider proactive thermal management, whereby servers can predict potential overheating events due to dynamics in data center configuration and workload, giving operators enough time to react. However, such forecasting is very challenging due to data center scales and complexity. Moreover, such a physical system is influenced by cyber effects, including workload scheduling in servers. We propose ThermoCast, a novel thermal forecasting model to predict the temperatures surrounding the servers in a data center, based on continuous streams of temperature and airflow measurements. Our approach is (a) capable of capturing cyberphysical interactions and automatically learning them from data; (b) computationally and physically scalable to data center scales; (c) able to provide online prediction with real-time sensor measurements. The paper's main contributions are: (i) We provide a systematic approach to integrate physical laws and sensor observations in a data center; (ii) We provide an algorithm that uses sensor data to learn the parameters of a data center's cyber-physical system. In turn, this ability enables us to reduce model complexity compared to full-fledged fluid dynamics models, while maintaining forecast accuracy; (iii) Unlike previous simulation-based studies, we perform experiments in a production data center. Using real data traces, we show that ThermoCast forecasts temperature better than a machine learning approach solely driven by data, and can successfully predict thermal alarms 4.2 minutes ahead of time.},

 abstract = {Throughout life, the cells in every individual accumulate many changes in the DNA inherited from his or her parents. Certain combinations of changes lead to cancer. During the last decade, the cost of DNA sequencing has been dropping by a factor of 10 every two years, making it now possible to read most of the three billion base genome from a patient's cancer tumor, and to try to determine all of the thousands of DNA changes in it. Under the auspices of NCI's Cancer Genome Atlas Project, 10,000 tumors will be sequenced in this manner in the next few years. Soon cancer genome sequencing will be a widespread clinical practice, and millions of tumors will be sequenced. A massive computational problem looms in interpreting these data. First, because we can only read short pieces of DNA, we have the enormous problem of assembling a coherent and reliable representation of the tumor genome from massive amounts of incomplete and error-prone evidence. This is the first challenge. Second, every human genome is unique from birth, and every tumor a unique variant. There is no single route to cancer. We must learn to read the varied signatures of cancer within the tumor genome and associate these with optimal treatments. Already there are hundreds of molecularly targeted treatments for cancer available, each known to be more or less effective depending on specific genetic variants. However, targeting a single gene with one treatment rarely works. The second challenge is to tackle the combinatorics of personalized, targeted, combination therapy in cancer.},

When the input graph cannot fit into main memory, triangle listing requires random disk accesses that can incur prohibitively large I/O cost.

 abstract = {Recent advances in search users' click modeling consider both users' search queries and click/skip behavior on documents to infer the user's perceived relevance. Most of these models, including dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) and user browsing models (UBM), use probabilistic models to understand user click behavior based on individual queries. The user behavior is more complex when her actions to satisfy her information needs form a search session, which may include multiple queries and subsequent click behaviors on various items on search result pages. Previous research is limited to treating each query within a search session in isolation, without paying attention to their dynamic interactions with other queries in a search session. Investigating this problem, we consider the sequence of queries and their clicks in a search session as a task and propose a task-centric click model~(TCM). TCM characterizes user behavior related to a task as a collective whole. Specifically, we identify and consider two new biases in TCM as the basis for user modeling. The first indicates that users tend to express their information needs incrementally in a task, and thus perform more clicks as their needs become clearer. The other illustrates that users tend to click fresh documents that are not included in the results of previous queries. Using these biases, TCM is more accurately able to capture user search behavior. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that by considering all the task information collectively, TCM can better interpret user click behavior and achieve significant improvements in terms of ranking metrics of NDCG and perplexity.},

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been extensively applied to detecting anomalies in network data streams. However, none of existing PCA based approaches addresses the problem of identifying the sources that contribute most to the observed anomaly, or anomaly localization. In this paper, we propose novel sparse PCA methods to perform anomaly detection and localization for network data streams. Our key observation is that we can localize anomalies by identifying a sparse low dimensional space that captures the abnormal events in data streams. To better capture the sources of anomalies, we incorporate the structure information of the network stream data in our anomaly localization framework. We have performed comprehensive experimental studies of the proposed methods, and have compared our methods with the state-ofthe-art using three real-world data sets from different application domains. Our experimental studies demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods.},

However a click is only the starting point of a user's journey and subsequent downstream utilities such as time-spent and revenue are important. In this paper, we call the problem of recommending links to jointly optimize for clicks and post-click downstream utilities click shaping. We propose a multi-objective programming approach in which multiple objectives are modeled in a constrained optimization framework. Such a formulation can naturally incorporate various application-driven requirements. We study several variants that model different requirements as constraints and discuss some of the subtleties involved. We conduct our experiments on a large dataset from a real system by using a newly proposed unbiased evaluation methodology [17].

However, many smart meter deployments support sample rates at most 1/900 Hz, which challenges activity analysis with occurrences of parallel activities, difficulty of aligning events, and lack of consumption features. We propose a novel statistical framework for disaggregation on coarse granular smart meter readings by modeling fixture characteristics, household behavior, and activity correlations.

 abstract = {The canonical technique for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, statistical parametric mapping, produces maps of brain locations that are more active during performance of a task than during a control condition. In recent years, there has been increasing awareness of the fact that there is information in the entire pattern of brain activation and not just in saliently active locations. Classifiers have been the tool of choice for capturing this information and used to make predictions ranging from what kind of object a subject is thinking about to what decision they will make. Such classifiers are usually trained on a selection of voxels from the 3D grid that makes up the activation pattern; often this means the best accuracy is obtained using few voxels, from all across the brain, and that different voxels will be chosen in different cross-validation folds, making the classifiers hard to interpret. The increasing commonality of datasets with tens to hundreds of classes makes this problem even more acute. In this paper we introduce a method for identifying informative subsets of adjacent voxels, corresponding to brain patches that distinguish subsets of classes. These patches can then be used to train classifiers for the distinctions they support and used as "pattern features" for a meta-classifier. We show that this method permits classification at a higher accuracy than that obtained with traditional voxel selection, and that the sets of voxels used are more reproducible across cross-validation folds than those identified with voxel selection, and lie in plausible brain locations.},

 abstract = {The problem of distance-based outlier detection is difficult to solve efficiently in very large datasets because of potential quadratic time complexity. We address this problem and develop sequential and distributed algorithms that are significantly more efficient than state-of-the-art methods while still guaranteeing the same outliers. By combining simple but effective indexing and disk block accessing techniques, we have developed a sequential algorithm iOrca that is up to an order-of-magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. The indexing scheme is based on sorting the data points in order of increasing distance from a fixed reference point and then accessing those points based on this sorted order. To speed up the basic outlier detection technique, we develop two distributed algorithms (DOoR and iDOoR) for modern distributed multi-core clusters of machines, connected on a ring topology. The first algorithm passes data blocks from each machine around the ring, incrementally updating the nearest neighbors of the points passed. By maintaining a cutoff threshold, it is able to prune a large number of points in a distributed fashion. The second distributed algorithm extends this basic idea with the indexing scheme discussed earlier. In our experiments, both distributed algorithms exhibit significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art distributed method [13].},

 abstract = {Diversified ranking on graphs is a fundamental mining task and has a variety of high-impact applications. There are two important open questions here. The first challenge is the measure - how to quantify the goodness of a given top-k ranking list that captures both the relevance and the diversity? The second challenge lies in the algorithmic aspect - how to find an optimal, or near-optimal, top-k ranking list that maximizes the measure we defined in a scalable way? In this paper, we address these challenges from an optimization point of view. Firstly, we propose a goodness measure for a given top-k ranking list. The proposed goodness measure intuitively captures both (a) the relevance between each individual node in the ranking list and the query; and (b) the diversity among different nodes in the ranking list. Moreover, we propose a scalable algorithm (linear wrt the size of the graph) that generates a provably near-optimal solution. The experimental evaluations on real graphs demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.},

 abstract = {Deemed "one of the top ten data mining mistakes", leakage is essentially the introduction of information about the data mining target, which should not be legitimately available to mine from. In addition to our own industry experience with real-life projects, controversies around several major public data mining competitions held recently such as the INFORMS 2010 Data Mining Challenge and the IJCNN 2011 Social Network Challenge are evidence that this issue is as relevant today as it has ever been. While acknowledging the importance and prevalence of leakage in both synthetic competitions and real-life data mining projects, existing literature has largely left this idea unexplored. What little has been said turns out not to be broad enough to cover more complex cases of leakage, such as those where the classical i.i.d. assumption is violated, that have been recently documented. In our new approach, these cases and others are explained by explicitly defining modeling goals and analyzing the broader framework of the data mining problem. The resulting definition enables us to derive general methodology for dealing with the issue. We show that it is possible to avoid leakage with a simple specific approach to data management followed by what we call a learn-predict separation, and present several ways of detecting leakage when the modeler has no control over how the data have been collected.},

 abstract = {The integrative mining of heterogeneous data and the interpretability of the data mining result are two of the most important challenges of today's data mining. It is commonly agreed in the community that, particularly in the research area of clustering, both challenges have not yet received the due attention. Only few approaches for clustering of objects with mixed-type attributes exist and those few approaches do not consider cluster-specific dependencies between numerical and categorical attributes. Likewise, only a few clustering papers address the problem of interpretability: to explain why a certain set of objects have been grouped into a cluster and what a particular cluster distinguishes from another. In this paper, we approach both challenges by constructing a relationship to the concept of data compression using the Minimum Description Length principle: a detected cluster structure is the better the more efficient it can be exploited for data compression. Following this idea, we can learn, during the run of a clustering algorithm, the optimal trade-off for attribute weights and distinguish relevant attribute dependencies from coincidental ones. We extend the efficient Cholesky decomposition to model dependencies in heterogeneous data and to ensure interpretability. Our proposed algorithm, INCONCO, successfully finds clusters in mixed type data sets, identifies the relevant attribute dependencies, and explains them using linear models and case-by-case analysis. Thereby, it outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness, as our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates.},

 abstract = {Probabilistic topic models have shown remarkable success in many application domains. However, a probabilistic conditional topic model can be extremely inefficient when considering a rich set of features because it needs to define a normalized distribution, which usually involves a hard-to-compute partition function. This paper presents conditional topical coding (CTC), a novel formulation of conditional topic models which is non-probabilistic. CTC relaxes the normalization constraints as in probabilistic models and learns non-negative document codes and word codes. CTC does not need to define a normalized distribution and can efficiently incorporate a rich set of features for improved topic discovery and prediction tasks. Moreover, CTC can directly control the sparsity of inferred representations by using appropriate regularization. We develop an efficient and easy-to-implement coordinate descent learning algorithm, of which each coding substep has a closed-form solution. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of CTC on online review analysis datasets. Our results show that conditional topical coding can achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance and is much more efficient in training (one order of magnitude faster) and testing (two orders of magnitude faster) than probabilistic conditional topic models.},

With one covariance matrix, this is principal component analysis (PCA). For multiple covariance matrices, we term the problem Common Component Analysis (CCA). While CCA can be posed as a tensor decomposition problem, standard approaches to tensor decompositions have two critical issues: (i) tensor decomposition methods are iterative and rely on the initialization; (ii) for a given level of approximation error, it is difficult to choose a suitable low dimensionality. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of CCA that yields an effective initialization and iterative algorithms for the problem. The proposed methodology has provable approximation guarantees w.r.t. the global maximum and also allows one to choose the dimensionality for a given level of approximation error. We also establish conditions under which the methodology will achieve the global maximum. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments on synthetic data as well as on two real stock market datasets, where major financial events can be visualized in low dimensions.},

In this paper we identify a new type of attack called a friendship attack. In a friendship attack, an adversary utilizes the degrees of two vertices connected by an edge to re-identify related victims in a published social network data set. To protect against such attacks, we introduce the concept of k2-degree anonymity, which limits the probability of a vertex being re-identified to 1/k. For the k2-degree anonymization problem, we propose an Integer Programming formulation to find optimal solutions in small-scale networks. We also present an efficient heuristic approach for anonymizing large-scale social networks against friendship attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can preserve much of the characteristics of social networks.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the problem of prominent streak discovery in sequence data. Given a sequence of values, a prominent streak is a long consecutive subsequence consisting of only large (small) values. For finding prominent streaks, we make the observation that prominent streaks are skyline points in two dimensions- streak interval length and minimum value in the interval. Our solution thus hinges upon the idea to separate the two steps in prominent streak discovery' candidate streak generation and skyline operation over candidate streaks. For candidate generation, we propose the concept of local prominent streak (LPS). We prove that prominent streaks are a subset of LPSs and the number of LPSs is less than the length of a data sequence, in comparison with the quadratic number of candidates produced by a brute-force baseline method. We develop efficient algorithms based on the concept of LPS. The non-linear LPS-based method (NLPS) considers a superset of LPSs as candidates, and the linear LPS-based method (LLPS) further guarantees to consider only LPSs. The results of experiments using multiple real datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods and showed orders of magnitude performance improvement against the baseline method.},

@inproceedings{Applegate:2011:UCM:2020408.2020508,
 abstract = {Multidimensional distributions are often used in data mining to describe and summarize different features of large datasets. It is natural to look for distinct classes in such datasets by clustering the data. A common approach entails the use of methods like k-means clustering. However, the k-means method inherently relies on the Euclidean metric in the embedded space and does not account for additional topology underlying the distribution. In this paper, we propose using Earth Mover Distance (EMD) to compare multidimensional distributions. For a n-bin histogram, the EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem with time complexity O(n3 log n). To mitigate the high computational cost of EMD, we propose an approximation that reduces the cost to linear time. Given the large size of our dataset a fast approximation is crucial for this application. Other notions of distances such as the information theoretic Kullback-Leibler divergence and statistical χ2 distance, account only for the correspondence between bins with the same index, and do not use information across bins, and are sensitive to bin size. A cross-bin distance measure like EMD is not affected by binning differences and meaningfully matches the perceptual notion of "nearness". Our technique is simple, efficient and practical for clustering distributions. We demonstrate the use of EMD on a real-world application of analyzing 411,550 anonymous mobility usage patterns which are defined as distributions over a manifold. EMD allows us to represent inherent relationships in this space, and enables us to successfully cluster even sparse signatures.},

 abstract = {Heterogeneous information networks are pervasive in applications ranging from bioinformatics to e-commerce. As a result, unsupervised learning and clustering methods pertaining to such networks have gained significant attention recently. Nodes in a heterogeneous information network are regarded as objects derived from distinct domains such as 'authors' and 'papers'. In many cases, feature sets characterizing the objects are not available, hence, clustering of the objects depends solely on the links and relationships amongst objects. Although several previous studies have addressed information network clustering, shortcomings remain. First, the definition of what constitutes an information network cluster varies drastically from study to study. Second, previous algorithms have generally focused on non-overlapping clusters, while many algorithms are also limited to specific network topologies. In this paper we introduce a game theoretic framework (GHIN) for defining and mining clusters in heterogeneous information networks. The clustering problem is modeled as a game wherein each domain represents a player and clusters are defined as the Nash equilibrium points of the game. Adopting the abstraction of Nash equilibrium points as clusters allows for flexible definition of reward functions that characterize clusters without any modification to the underlying algorithm. We prove that well-established definitions of clusters in 2-domain information networks such as formal concepts, maximal bi-cliques, and noisy binary tiles can always be represented as Nash equilibrium points. Moreover, experimental results employing a variety of reward functions and several real world information networks illustrate that the GHIN framework produces more accurate and informative clusters than the recently proposed NetClus and state of the art MDC algorithms.},

Existing programming paradigms for expressing large-scale parallelism such as MapReduce (MR) and the Message Passing Interface (MPI) have been the de facto choices for implementing these ML-DM algorithms. The MR programming paradigm has been of particular interest as it gracefully handles large datasets and has built-in resilience against failures. However, the existing parallel programming paradigms are too low-level and ill-suited for implementing ML-DM algorithms. To address this deficiency, we present NIMBLE, a portable infrastructure that has been specifically designed to enable the rapid implementation of parallel ML-DM algorithms. The infrastructure allows one to compose parallel ML-DM algorithms using reusable (serial and parallel) building blocks that can be efficiently executed using MR and other parallel programming models; it currently runs on top of Hadoop, which is an open-source MR implementation. We show how NIMBLE can be used to realize scalable implementations of ML-DM algorithms and present a performance evaluation.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a fast approximate similarity search method for finding the most similar object to a given query object from an object set with a dissimilarity with a success probability exceeding a given value. As a search index, the proposed method utilizes a degree-reduced k-nearest neighbor (k-DR) graph constructed from the object set with the dissimilarity, and explores the k-DR graph along its edges using a greedy search (GS) algorithm starting from multiple initial vertices with parallel processing. In the graph-construction stage, the structural parameter k of the k-DR graph is determined so that the probability with which at least one search trial of those with multiple initial vertices succeeds is more than the given success probability. To estimate the greedy-search success probability, we introduce the concept of a basin in the k-DR graph. The experimental results on a real data set verify the approximation scheme and high search performance of the proposed method and demonstrate that it is superior to E2LSH in terms of the expected search cost.},

 abstract = {Sensor nodes have limited local storage, computational power, and battery life, as a result of which it is desirable to minimize the storage, processing and communication from these nodes during data collection. The problem is further magnified by the large volumes of data collected. In real applications, sensor streams are often highly correlated with one another or may have other kinds of functional dependencies. For example, a group of sound sensors in a given geographical proximity may pick almost the same set of signals. Clearly, since there are considerable functional dependencies between different sensors, there are huge  redundancies in the data collected by sensors. These redundancies may also change as the data evolve over time. In this paper, we discuss real time algorithms for reducing the volume of the data collected in sensor networks. The broad idea is to determine the functional dependencies between sensor streams efficiently in real time, and actively collect the data only from a minimal set of sensors. The remaining sensors collect the data passively at low sampling rates in order to detect any changing trends in the underlying data. We present real time algorithms in order to minimize the power consumption in reducing the data collected and show that the resulting data retains almost the same amount of information at a much lower cost.},

 abstract = {Chronic diseases constitute the leading cause of mortality in the western world, have a major impact on the patients' quality of life, and comprise the bulk of healthcare costs. Nowadays, healthcare data management systems integrate large amounts of medical information on patients, including diagnoses, medical procedures, lab test results, and more. Sophisticated analysis methods are needed for utilizing these data to assist in patient management and to enhance treatment quality at reduced costs. In this study, we take a first step towards better disease management of diabetic patients by applying state-of-the art methods to anticipate the patient's future health condition and to identify patients at high risk. Two relevant outcome measures are explored: the need for emergency care services and the probability of the treatment producing a sub-optimal result, as defined by domain experts. By identifying the high-risk patients our prediction system can be used by healthcare providers to prepare both financially and logistically for the patient needs. To demonstrate a potential downstream application for the identified high-risk patients, we explore the association between the physician treating these patients and the treatment outcome, and propose a system that can assist healthcare providers in optimizing the match between a patient and a physician. Our work formulates the problem and examines the performance of several learning models on data from several thousands of patients. We further describe a pilot system built on the results of this analysis. We show that the risk for the two considered outcomes can be evaluated from patients' characteristics and that features of the patient-physician match improve the prediction accuracy for the treatment's success. These results suggest that personalized medicine can be valuable for high risk patients and raise interesting questions for future improvements.},

 abstract = {The area of constrained clustering has been actively pursued for the last decade. A more recent extension that will be the focus of this paper is constrained hierarchical clustering which allows building user-constrained dendrograms/trees. Like all forms of constrained clustering, previous work on hierarchical constrained clustering uses simple constraints that are typically implemented in a procedural language. However, there exists mature results and packages in the fields of constraint satisfaction languages and solvers that the constrained clustering field has yet to explore. This work marks the first steps towards introducing constraints satisfaction languages/solvers into hierarchical constrained clustering. We make several significant contributions. We show how many existing and new constraints for hierarchical clustering, can be modeled as a Horn-SAT problem that is easily solvable in polynomial time and which allows their implementation in any number of declarative languages or efficient solvers. We implement our own solver for efficiency reasons. We then show how to formulate constrained hierarchical clustering in a flexible manner so that any number of algorithms, whose output is a dendrogram, can make use of the constraints.},

We first define what the problem of mining partially annotated images is, and argue that in many real-world applications annotated images are typically partially annotated and thus that the problem of mining partially annotated images exists in many situations. We then propose an effective solution to this problem based on a statistical model we have developed called the Semi-Supervised Correspondence Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (SSCHDP). The main idea of this model lies in exploiting the information pertaining to partially annotated images or even unannotated images to achieve semi-supervised learning under the HDP structure. We apply this model to completing the annotations appropriately for partially annotated images in the training data and then to predicting the annotations appropriately and completely for all the unannotated images either in the training data or in any unseen data beyond the training process. Experiments show that SSC-HDP is superior to the peer models from the recent literature when they are applied to solving the problem of mining partially annotated images.},

 abstract = {Most traditional supervised learning methods are developed to learn a model from labeled examples and use this model to classify the unlabeled ones into the same label space predefined by the models. However, in many real world applications, the label spaces for both the labeled/training and unlabeled/testing examples can be different. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel notion of Serendipitous Learning (SL), which is defined to address the learning scenarios in which the label space can be enlarged during the testing phase. In particular, a large margin approach is proposed to solve SL. The basic idea is to leverage the knowledge in the labeled examples to help identify novel/unknown classes, and the large margin formulation is proposed to incorporate both the classification loss on the examples within the known categories, as well as the clustering loss on the examples in unknown categories. An efficient optimization algorithm based on CCCP and the bundle method is proposed to solve the optimization problem of the large margin formulation of SL. Moreover, an efficient online learning method is proposed to address the issue of large scale data in online learning scenario, which has been shown to have a guaranteed learning regret. An extensive set of experimental results on two synthetic datasets and two datasets from real world applications demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over several other baseline algorithms. One limitation of the proposed method is that the number of unknown classes is given in advance. It may be possible to remove this constraint if we model it by using a non-parametric way. We also plan to do experiments on more real world applications in the future.},

 abstract = {Online user reviews play a central role in the decision-making process of users for a variety of tasks, ranging from entertainment and shopping to medical services. As user-generated reviews proliferate, it becomes critical to have a mechanism for helping the users (information consumers) deal with the information overload, and presenting them with a small comprehensive set of reviews that satisfies their information need. This is particularly important for mobile phone users, who need to make decisions quickly, and have a device with limited screen real-estate for displaying the reviews. Previous approaches have addressed the problem by ranking reviews according to their (estimated) helpfulness. However, such approaches do not account for the fact that the top few high-quality reviews may be highly redundant, repeating the same information, or presenting the same positive (or negative) perspective. In this work, we focus on the problem of selecting a comprehensive set of few high-quality reviews that cover many different aspects of the reviewed item. We formulate the problem as a maximum coverage problem, and we present a generic formalism that can model the different variants of review-set selection. We describe algorithms for the different variants we consider, and, whenever possible, we provide approximation guarantees with respect to the optimal solution. We also perform an experimental evaluation on real data in order to understand the value of coverage for users.},

By examining the relation between urban mobility and fare purchasing habits in large datasets from London, England's public transport network, we estimate that travellers in the city cumulatively spend, per year, up to approximately GBP 200 million more than they need to, as a result of purchasing the incorrect fares. We propose to address these incorrect purchases by leveraging the huge volumes of data that travellers create as they move about the city, by providing, to each of them, personalised ticket recommendations based on their estimated future travel patterns. In this work, we explore the viability of building a fare-recommendation system for public transport networks by (a) formalising the problem as two separate prediction problems and (b) evaluating a number of algorithms that aim to match travellers to the best fare. We find that applying data mining techniques to public transport data has the potential to provide travellers with substantial savings.},

Recently, there has been significant interest in a class of ranking algorithms based on the assumption that data is sampled from a low dimensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional Euclidean space. In this paper, we study a popular graph Laplacian based ranking algorithm [23] using an analytical method, which provides theoretical insights into the ranking algorithm going beyond the intuitive idea of "diffusion." Our analysis shows that the algorithm is sensitive to a commonly used parameter due to the use of symmetric normalized graph Laplacian. We also show that the ranking function may diverge to infinity at the query point in the limit of infinite samples. To address these issues, we propose an improved ranking algorithm on manifolds using Green's function of an iterated unnormalized graph Laplacian, which is more robust and density adaptive, as well as pointwise continuous in the limit of infinite samples. We also for the first time in the ranking literature empirically explore two variants from a family of twice normalized graph Laplacians. Experimental results on text and image data support our analysis, which also suggest the potential value of twice normalized graph Laplacians in practice.},

Companies in the commercial sector have long understood the importance of being able to anticipate or predict future behavior and demand in order to respond efficiently and effectively. Embracing the promise of predictive analytics, the public safety community is moving from a focus on "what happened," to a system that enables the ability to anticipate future events and effectively deploy resources in front of crime; thereby, changing outcomes. While we have become familiar with the use of advanced analytics in support of fraud detection and prevention, techniques similar to those used to support customer loyalty programs and supply chain management have been used to prevent and solve violent crimes, enhance investigative pace and efficacy, support information-based risk and threat assessment, and deploy public safety resources more efficiently. As public safety agencies increasingly are asked to do more with less, the ability to anticipate crime represents a game changing paradigm shift; enabling information-based tactics, strategy and policy in support of prevention and response. Reporting, collecting and compiling data are necessary but not sufficient to increasing public safety. Ultimately, the ability to anticipate, prevent and respond more effectively will enable us to do more with less and change public safety outcomes.},

Since exact discovery may be computationally intractable, we introduce a novel sampling scheme which enables approximate discovery of highly reliable subgraphs with high probability. Furthermore, we transform the core mining task into a new frequent cohesive set problem in deterministic graphs. Such transformation enables the development of an efficient two-stage approach which combines novel peeling techniques for maximal set discovery with depth-first search for further enumeration.

 abstract = {Keeping in pace with the increasing importance of commerce conducted over the Web, several e-commerce websites now provide admirable facilities for helping consumers decide what product to buy and where to buy it. However, since the prices of durable and high-tech products generally fall over time, a buyer of such products is often faced with a dilemma: Should she buy the product now or wait for cheaper prices? We present the design and implementation of Prodcast, an experimental system whose goal is to help consumers decide when to buy a product. The system makes use of forecasts of future prices based on price histories of the products, incorporating features such as sales volume, seasonality, and competition in making its recommendation. We describe techniques that are well-suited for this task and present a comprehensive evaluation of their relative merits using retail sales data for electronic products. Our back-testing of the system indicates that the system is capable of helping consumers time their purchase, resulting in significant savings to them.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses estimating the number of the users of a specific application behind IP addresses (IPs). This problem is central to combating abusive traffic, such as DDoS attacks, ad click fraud and email spam. We share our experience building a general framework at Google for estimating the number of users behind IPs, called hereinafter the sizes of the IPs. The primary goal of this framework is combating abusive traffic without violating the user privacy. The estimation techniques produce statistically sound estimates of sizes relying solely on passively mining aggregated application log data, without probing machines or deploying active content like Java applets. This paper also explores using the estimated sizes to detect and filter abusive traffic. The proposed framework was used to build and deploy an ad click fraud filter at Google. The first 50M clicks tagged by the filter had a significant recall of all tagged clicks, and their false positive rate was below 1.4%. For the sake of comparison, we simulated a naive IP-based filter that does not consider the sizes of the IPs. To reach a comparable recall, the naive filter's false positive rate was 37% due to aggressive tagging.},
