 abstract = {Modern wireless devices such as tablets and smartphones are pushing the demand for higher and higher wireless data rates. The vast majority of this demand comes from media content. In this paper we propose to combine two recent ideas, distributed caching of content in small cells, and, cooperative transmissions from nearby base stations/BSs (generally known as coordinated multi-point), to achieve unprecedented content delivery speeds while reducing backhaul cost and delay. A key characteristic of our architecture is the interdependence between the caching strategy and the PHY/MAC layer coordination. Specifically, the caching strategy may cache different content in nearby BSs to maximize the hit ratio, or cache the same content in multiple nearby BSs such that the corresponding BSs can transmit concurrently, e.g. to multiple users using zero force beamforming, and achieve multiplexing gains. With this in mind, given the popularity distribution of the content, the available cache size, and the network topology, we devise optimal strategies of caching such that the throughput of the system is maximized. Our analytical and simulation results show that our system yields significantly faster content delivery, which, under realistic scenarios and assumptions can be one order of magnitude faster than that of legacy systems.},

 abstract = {We introduce SmartGuide, a light-weighted and efficient approach to localize and recognize a distant unknown building. Our approach relies on shooting only a single photo of a target building via a smartphone and a local 2D Google map. SmartGuide first extracts a partial top view contour of a building from its side-view photo by applying vanishing point and the Manhattan World Assumption, and then fetches a candidate building set from a local 2D Google map based on smartphone's GPS readings. Partial top view shape, orientation and distance relative to the camera are used as input parameters in a probability model, which adversely recognizes the best candidate building in the local map. Our model is developed based on kernel density estimation that helps reduce noise in the smartphone sensors, such as GPS readings and camera ray direction reported by noisy accelerometer and compass. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach recognizes buildings ranging from 20m to 520m and achieves 92.7% accuracy in downtown areas where the Manhattan World Assumption is applicable. In addition, the processing time is no more than 6 seconds for 87% of cases. Compared with existing building localization schemes, SmartGuide offers numerous advantages. Our method avoids taking multiple photos, intricate 3D reconstruction or any initial deployment cost of database construction, making it faster and less labor-intensive than existing solutions.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a hopless networking paradigm. Incorporating recent techniques of rateless codes, senders break packets into rateless information streams and each single stream automatically adapts to diverse channel qualities at all potential receivers, regardless of their hop distances. The receivers are capable of accumulating rateless information pieces from different senders and jointly decoding the packet, largely improving throughput. We develop a practical protocol, called HOPE, which instantiates the hopless networking paradigm. Compared with the existing opportunistic routing protocol family, HOPE best exploits the wireless channel diversity and takes full advantage of the wireless broadcast effect. HOPE incurs minimum protocol overhead and serves general networking applications. We extensively evaluate the performance of HOPE with indoor network traces collected from USRP N210s and Intel 5300 NICs. The results show that HOPE achieves 1.7x and 1.3x goodput gain over ExOR and MIXIT, respectively.},

 abstract = {In multi-tier heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs), both horizontal and vertical handoffs impact the signaling overhead and quality of service in the system. However, they are difficult to analyze due to the diverse and irregularly shaped cells in HWNs. The causes of this irregularity are three-fold: (1) small-cell base stations (BSs) tend to be deployed with a high level of spatial randomness; (2) BSs are likely to aggregate around highly populated geographical regions; (3) various transmission power levels in different tiers further create diverse cell sizes and shapes. In this work we present a new stochastic geometric analysis framework on user mobility in HWNs. Each tier of BSs is modeled as either a Poisson point process (PPP) or a Poisson cluster process (PCP), to capture their spatial randomness and their non-uniform and dependent aggregation in space. Flexible user association is also taken into consideration, such that various scales of cell sizes are accommodated. We derive analytical expressions for the rates of all handoff types experienced by an active user with arbitrary movement trajectory. We also demonstrate an example application of the proposed analysis, in optimizing the multi-tier BS selection by users, to balance the tradeoff between data rate and handoff overhead. Finally, extensive simulation is conducted to validate the correctness and usefulness of our analysis.},

 abstract = {The goal of this paper is to infer features of urban ecology (i.e., social and economic activities, and social interaction) from spatiotemporal cell phone activity data. We present a novel approach that consists of (i) time series decomposition of the aggregate cell phone activity per unit area using spectral methods, (ii) clustering of areal units with similar activity patterns, and (ii) external validation using a ground truth data set we collected from municipal and online sources. The key to our approach is the spectral decomposition of the original cell phone activity series into seasonal communication series (SCS) and residual communication series (RCS). The former captures regular patterns of socio-economic activity within an area and can be used to segment a city into distinct clusters. RCS across areas enables the detection of regions that are subject to mutual social influence and of regions that are in direct communication contact. The RCS and SCS thus provide distinct probes into the structure and dynamics of the urban environment, both of which can be obtained from the same underlying data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology by applying it to aggregate Call Description Records (CDRs) from the city of Milan.},

Traditional approaches (e.g., Polysomnography (PSG)) are limited to clinic usage. Recent radio frequency (RF) based approaches require specialized devices or dedicated wireless sensors and are only able to track breathing rate. In this work, we propose to track the vital signs of both breathing rate and heart rate during sleep by using off-the-shelf WiFi without any wearable or dedicated devices. Our system re-uses existing WiFi network and exploits the fine-grained channel information to capture the minute movements caused by breathing and heart beats. Our system thus has the potential to be widely deployed and perform continuous long-term monitoring. The developed algorithm makes use of the channel information in both time and frequency domain to estimate breathing and heart rates, and it works well when either individual or two persons are in bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can accurately capture vital signs during sleep under realistic settings, and achieve comparable or even better performance comparing to traditional and existing approaches, which is a strong indication of providing non-invasive, continuous fine-grained vital signs monitoring without any additional cost.},

The use of interference-emitting jammers to protect these sensitive communications has been recently explored in the literature, and has shown high potential. In this paper we consider optimization problems relating to the temporal distributions of jammers' activity, and the suitable coding regimes used for communication. Solving the joint problem optimally enables comprehensive security in space, at a low power consumption and low communication overhead. The joint optimization of jamming in space and time is driven by a new framework that uses the bit-error probability as a measure of communication quality. Under this framework, we show how to guarantee information-theoretic security within a geographic region, and with increased flexibility to tailor the coding regime to the problem's geometry. We present efficient algorithms for different settings, and provide simulations for various scenarios using the bit-error probability functions. These simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme. We believe that our scheme can lead to practical, economical and scalable solutions for providing another layer of protection of sensitive data, in cases where encryption schemes are limited or impractical.},

 abstract = {Neighbor discovery is a fundamental problem in wireless networks. In this paper, we study asynchronous neighbor discovery between duty-cycled mobile devices. Each node is duty-cycled, i.e., its radio may only be active for a small fraction of the time. The duty cycles of the nodes can be the same or different, leading to symmetric or asymmetric cases of the neighbor discovery problem. In addition, the setting is asynchronous, i.e., clocks of different nodes may not be synchronized. Most existing studies assume an integer model (where time proceeds in discrete steps); two recent studies break away from this assumption, which allows them to develop significantly more efficient schemes. Our study improves the state-of-the-art in three main fronts. Firstly, we develop a generalized non-integer model (where time is continuous) that permits unified treatment of the assumptions in existing studies. We also provide a reduction that transforms any schedule in the basic integer model to a corresponding schedule in the generalized non-integer model while improving the performance by a factor of two. Applying this reduction, an optimal schedule in the integer model becomes an optimal schedule in the non-integer model. Thirdly, we establish a new family of lower bounds for the best achievable latency guarantee in the non-integer model. They are applicable to both symmetric and asymmetric settings, and encompass the lower bounds for the integer model as special cases. Finally, we develop a novel optimal construction based on Sidon sets for the symmetric setting. Our approach differs from the approaches taken by all existing studies, and provides a new direction for constructing neighbor discovery schedules.},

Hence we focus on the distributed case, and propose an asynchronous and distributed task selection (ADTS) algorithm to help the users plan their task selections on their own. We prove the convergence of the algorithm, and further characterize the computation time for users' updates in the algorithm. Simulation results suggest that the ADTS scheme achieves the highest Jain's fairness index and coverage comparing with several benchmark algorithms, while yielding similar user payoff to a greedy centralized benchmark. Finally, we illustrate how mobile users coordinate under the ADTS scheme based on some practical movement time data derived from Google Maps.},

The SocialYou system only needs a single-finger action that drags the icon of social networking websites to the target face on the screen of a smartphone. The target user webpage in a specific social networking website can be immediately displayed in the social media App or built-in web browser. Through SocialYou, mobile users do not need to know the target identifier in advance. In addition, mobile users do not need to input identifier information by themselves. Furthermore, mobile users can select a specific target among multiple candidates from the camera of a smartphone.

In this paper, we study a critical problem in MCS systems, namely, incentivizing user participation. Different from existing work, we incorporate a crucial metric, called users' quality of information (QoI), into our incentive mechanisms for MCS systems. Due to various factors (e.g., sensor quality, noise, etc.) the quality of the sensory data contributed by individual users varies significantly. Obtaining high quality data with little expense is always the ideal of MCS platforms. Technically, we design incentive mechanisms based on reverse combinatorial auctions. We investigate both the single-minded and multi-minded combinatorial auction models. For the former, we design a truthful, individual rational and computationally efficient mechanism that approximately maximizes the social welfare with a guaranteed approximation ratio. For the latter, we design an iterative descending mechanism that achieves close-to-optimal social welfare while satisfying individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we validate our theoretical analysis about the close-to-optimal social welfare and fast running time of our mechanisms.},

In order to exploit the low-cost services offered by these resource-rich data centers, application developers are pushing computing and storage away from the end-devices and instead deeper into the data-centers. Hence, the end-users' experience is now dependent on the performance of the algorithms used for data retrieval, and job scheduling within the data-centers. In particular, providing low-latency services are critically important to the end-user experience for a wide variety of applications.

ACM MobiHoc is the premier international symposium dedicated to addressing challenges emerging from wireless networking and computing. The highly selective technical program has traditionally brought together a unique blend of researchers and practitioners, thereby influencing the direction of a wide range of wireless networking research areas. We hope that you will find the conference intellectually stimulating. We are delighted to report that this year's program continues the tradition of excellence set by this conference over the years. We received 250 submissions, which has made it extremely challenging to select only 37 papers for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. At such a selective acceptance rate (14.8%) many of the papers that we could not accept are of high quality and we are certain that many of them will appear in the near future at other top-tier conferences. The paper selection process was handled by the Technical Program Committee (TPC). The TPC included 65 excellent members with expertise spanning all the major areas relevant to the conference scope. In particular, the TPC was composed of members from 16 countries and included 11 members from research labs and industry. The 250 submitted papers went through a first phase of reviews followed by a very active online discussion phase. Then, several papers went through a second review phase. The reviews were provided by the TPC members and, when needed, a few reviews were provided by external expert reviewers. At the end of this process and based on the results of the online discussion, 12 papers were accepted and 46 papers were further discussed at the TPC meeting that was held on Feb. 28, 2015 at Columbia University in New York. Following the discussions at the meeting, 25 additional papers were accepted. Ten of the accepted papers were assigned shepherds who volunteered to assist the authors during the process of preparing the final version. The work of the TPC was outstanding and we thank all the members for the time and efforts they dedicated to the paper selection process and to attending the meeting. These efforts make this wonderful conference possible. We are pleased with the strong technical program of the conference, represented by the papers in these proceedings. The conference program covers a wide range of topics, including routing, scheduling, algorithms, performance evaluation, dynamic spectrum access, cellular networks, sensor networks, mobile applications and crowdsensing, security, and wireless systems. This year's program is preceded by a set of seven workshops. It continues the tradition of having keynote talks from outstanding leaders in the field, and it includes a poster/demo session. The keynote speakers are Prof. Ness B. Shroff, the Ohio Eminent Scholar in Networking and Communications at The Ohio State University, Prof. Wen Gao, Vice President of the NSF of China, and Prof. Andrea Goldsmith, the Stephen Harris Professor in the School of Engineering, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.},

 abstract = {Making judicious channel access and transmission scheduling decisions is essential for improving performance (delay, throughput, etc.) as well as energy and spectral efficiency in multichannel wireless systems. This problem has been a subject of extensive study in the past decade, and the resulting dynamic and opportunistic channel access schemes can bring potentially significant improvement over traditional schemes. However, a common and severe limitation of these dynamic schemes is that they almost always require some form of a priori knowledge of the channel statistics. A natural remedy is a learning framework, which has also been extensively studied in the same context, but a typical learning algorithm in this literature seeks only the best static policy (i.e., to stay in the best channel), with performance measured by weak regret, rather than learning a good dynamic channel access policy. There is thus a clear disconnect between what an optimal channel access policy can achieve with known channel statistics that actively exploits temporal, spatial and spectral diversity, and what a typical existing learning algorithm aims for, which is the static use of a single channel devoid of diversity gain. In this paper we bridge this gap by designing learning algorithms that track known optimal or sub-optimal dynamic channel access and transmission scheduling policies, thereby yielding performance measured by a form of strong regret, the accumulated difference between the reward returned by an optimal solution when a priori information is available and that by our online algorithm. We do so in the context of two specific algorithms that appeared in [1] and [2], respectively, the former for a multiuser single-channel setting and the latter for a single-user multichannel setting. In both cases we show that our algorithms achieve sub-linear regret uniform in time and outperforms the standard weak-regret learning algorithms.},

 abstract = {In cyber-physical systems such as automobiles, measurement data from sensor nodes should be delivered to other consumer nodes such as actuators in a regular fashion. But, in practical systems over unreliable media such as wireless, it is a significant challenge to guarantee small enough inter-delivery times for different clients with heterogeneous channel conditions and inter-delivery requirements. In this paper, we design scheduling policies aiming at satisfying the inter-delivery requirements of such clients. We formulate the problem as a risk-sensitive Markov Decision Process (MDP). Although the resulting problem involves an infinite state space, we first prove that there is an equivalent MDP involving only a finite number of states. Then we prove the existence of a stationary optimal policy and establish an algorithm to compute it in a finite number of steps. However, the bane of this and many similar problems is the resulting complexity, and, in an attempt to make fundamental progress, we further propose a new high reliability asymptotic approach. In essence, this approach considers the scenario when the channel failure probabilities for different clients are of the same order, and asymptotically approach zero. We thus proceed to determine the asymptotically optimal policy: in a two-client scenario, we show that the asymptotically optimal policy is a "modified least time-to-go" policy, which is intuitively appealing and easily implementable; in the general multi-client scenario, we are led to an SN policy, and we develop an algorithm of low computational complexity to obtain it. Simulation results show that the resulting policies perform well even in the pre-asymptotic regime with moderate failure probabilities.},

The performance of each client is measured by the amount of time that its video playback halts due to buffer underflow, which has been shown to have the most impact on client's perceived quality of experience (QoE). We develop an analytical framework that jointly captures the video playback process and the unreliable and heterogeneous wireless channels. We derive the capacity region for QoE by establishing a lower bound of a weighted sum of video halt durations over all clients. We then propose a QoE-optimal policy that can achieve every point within the capacity region. Finally, we compare our policy against two commonly used policies.

 abstract = {Today's "white space" model of spectrum sharing applied in the UHF TV band allows channels that are not being used regionally by a TV broadcaster to be re-purposed for unlicensed-style secondary access in 24 hour increments. Unfortunately, populated areas have few unused channels for white space usage. Nonetheless, from the UHF TV viewer's perspective, Nielsen data show severe under-utilization of this spectrum, with vast regions that are in range of TV transmitters having no active TV receivers on multiple channels even at peak TV viewing times. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of WATCH (WiFi in Active TV CHannels), the first system to enable secondary WiFi transmission even in the presence of kilowatt-scale TV transmitters, while simultaneously protecting TV receivers when they are active. To protect active TV receivers, WATCH includes a smartphone-based TV remote or an Internet-connected TV to inform the WATCH controller of TV receivers' spatial-spectral requirements. To enable WiFi transmission in UHF bands, we design WATCH-IC (Interference Cancellation) and CAT (Constructive Addition Transmission) to (i) exploit the unique environment of asynchronous WiFi transmission in the presence of a strong streaming interferer, and (ii) require no coordination with legacy TV transmitters. With FCC permission to test our implementation, we show that WATCH can provide at least 6 times the total achievable rate to 4 watt secondary devices compared to current TV white space systems, while limiting the increase in TV channel switching time to less than 5%.},

 abstract = {The recent development of social services tightens wireless users' social relationships and encourages them to generate more data traffic under network effect. This boosts the demand for wireless services yet may challenge the limited wireless capacity. To fully exploit this opportunity, we study mobile users' data usage behaviors by jointly considering the network effect based on their social relationships in the social domain and the congestion effect in the physical wireless domain. Accordingly, we develop a Stackelberg game for problem formulation: In Stage I, a wireless provider first decides the data pricing to all users to maximize its revenue, and then in Stage II users observe the price and decide data usage subject to mutual interactions under both network and congestion effects. We analyze the two-stage game using backward induction. For Stage II, we first show the existence and uniqueness of a user demand equilibrium (UDE). Then we propose a distributed update algorithm for users to reach the UDE. Furthermore, we investigate the impacts of different parameters on the UDE. For Stage I, we develop an optimal pricing algorithm to maximize the wireless provider's revenue. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms by numerical studies using real data, and thereby draw useful engineering insights for the operation of wireless providers.},

 abstract = {Auction is a promising approach for dynamic spectrum access in Cognitive Radio Networks. Existing auction mechanisms are mainly proposed to be strategy-proof to stimulate bidders to reveal their valuations of spectrum truthfully. However, they would suffer significantly from a new cheating pattern named false-name bids, where a bidder can manipulate the auction by submitting bids under multiple fictitious names. We show such false-name bid cheating is easy to make but hard to be detected in dynamic spectrum auctions. To resolve this issue, we propose ALETHEIA, a novel flexible, false-name-proof auction framework for large-scale dynamic spectrum access. ALETHEIA has the following important features: (1) it not only guarantees strategy-proofness but also resists false-name bids, (2) it enables spectrum reuse across a large number of bidders, (3) it provides the bidders the flexibility of diverse demand formats, and (4) it incurs low computational overhead. Simulation results show that ALETHEIA achieves both high spectrum redistribution efficiency and auction efficiency.},

The proposed solution is based on a generalization of Trellis Coded Modulation combined with Cryptographic Interleaving. We develop algorithms for discovering explicit codes for concealing any modulation in {BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM}. We propose a 2-pass frequency correction and phase tracking mechanisms that enables the proposed schemes to reach their potential. We demonstrate that in most cases this rate hiding scheme has the side effect of boosting resiliency by up to 7dB (simulations) and 4dB (SDR experiments).},

However, content retrieval, especially for embedded links and multimedia, can often be too slow, too energy hungry or too expensive for on-the-go mobile users. To address these issues, we collect and analyze a large set of traces from over 6000 real-life users of a popular mobile Twitter client. Based on the unique challenges identified from our dataset, we present inference-based social network content prefetcher, Earlybird. It uses the specific signals unique to social data in order to retrieve news feeds and associated links and multimedia ahead of users' usage. Our regression-based content prediction model is able to estimate a user's likely content interests 55% of the time. Second, we develop a prefetch scheduling scheme to maximize delay reduction under users' resource constraints. For validation, we apply Earlybird to our collected dataset. We show that on average users can reduce their delays by 62% at the cost of no more than 3% battery and 40MB/month cellular data.},

 abstract = {Poor scalability is a long standing problem in multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) networks: in order to select concurrent uplink users with strong channel orthogonality and thus high total capacity, channel state information (CSI) feedback from users is required. However, when the user population is large, the overhead from CSI feedback can easily overwhelm the actual channel time spent on data transmission. Moreover, due to spontaneous uplink traffic, uplink user selection cannot rely on the access point's central assignment and needs a distributed realization instead, which makes the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a fully scalable and distributed uplink MU-MIMO protocol called Signpost. Firstly, Signpost is scalable, i.e., it achieves zero CSI overhead by exploiting a novel orthogonality evaluation mechanism that enables each user to speculate its orthogonality to other users, using its own CSI only. Secondly, Signpost realizes distributed user selection through a two-dimensional prioritized contention mechanism, which can single out the best users efficiently by utilizing both the time and frequency domain resources. The contention mechanism includes a unique collision recovery scheme, which enables Signpost to achieve a collision probability as low as one-tenth compared with traditional 802.11-like mechanism. Software-radio based implementation and testbed experimentation show that Signpost significantly outperforms state-of-the-art user selection methods under various traffic patterns and node mobility.},

 abstract = {Multi-view wireless video streaming has the potential to enable a new generation of efficient and low-power pervasive surveillance systems that can capture scenes of interest from multiple perspectives, at higher resolution, and with lower energy consumption. However, state-of-the-art multi-view coding architectures require relatively complex predictive encoders, thus resulting in high processing complexity and power requirements. To address these challenges, we consider a wireless video surveillance scenario and propose a new encoding and decoding architecture for multi-view video systems based on Compressed Sensing (CS) principles, composed of cooperative sparsity-aware block-level rate-adaptive encoders, feedback channels and independent decoders. The proposed architecture leverages the properties of CS to overcome many limitations of traditional encoding techniques, specifically massive storage requirements and high computational complexity. It also uses estimates of image sparsity to perform efficient rate adaptation and effectively exploit inter-view correlation at the encoder side. Based on the proposed encoding/decoding architecture, we further develop a CS-based end-to-end rate distortion model by considering the effect of packet losses on the perceived video quality. We then introduce a modeling framework to design network optimization problems in a multi-hop wireless sensor network. Extensive performance evaluation results show that the proposed coding framework and power-minimizing delivery scheme are able to transmit multi-view streams with guaranteed video quality at low power consumption.},

 abstract = {We introduce State-Informed Link-Layer Queuing (SILQ), a system that models, predicts, and avoids packet delivery failures caused by temporary wireless outages in everyday scenarios. By stabilizing connections in adverse link conditions, SILQ boosts throughput and reduces performance variation for network applications, for example by preventing unnecessary TCP timeouts due to dead zones, elevators, and subway tunnels. SILQ makes predictions in real-time by actively probing links, matching measurements to an overcomplete dictionary of patterns learned offline, and classifying the resulting sparse feature vectors to identify those that precede outages. We use a clustering method called sparse coding to build our data-driven link model, and show that it produces more variation-tolerant predictions than traditional loss-rate, location-based, or Markov chain techniques. We present extensive data collection and field-validation of SILQ in airborne, indoor, and urban scenarios of practical interest. We show how offline unsupervised learning discovers link-state patterns that are stable across diverse networks and signal-propagation environments. Using these canonical primitives, we train outage predictors for 802.11 (Wi-Fi) and 3G cellular networks to demonstrate TCP throughput gains of 4x with off-the-shelf mobile devices. SILQ addresses delivery failures solely at the link layer, requires no new hardware, and upholds the end-to-end design principle, to enable easy integration across applications, devices, and networks.},

 abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are inherently multi - constrained. They need to preserve energy while offering reliable and timely data reporting for a non-negligible number of scenarios. This is particularly true when a node should decide which forwarder has to be chosen for routing a packet. Nevertheless, solving multi-constrained routing problems is NP-complete. Most approaches involve transforming the problem into a single constrained problem using a cost function, although this may lead to suboptimal solutions. Some other solutions are based on heuristics. However, their high implementation complexity prevents their online use. Hence, they are not suitable for highly dynamic WSNs. In this paper we make use of Operator Calculus (OC) methods on graphs to solve path selection in the presence of multiple constraints. OC has lower resolution time complexity compared to other techniques. Based on OC, we develop a distributed algorithm for path selection in a graph. We develop a new routing protocol which makes use of this algorithm: the Operator Calculus based Routing Protocol (OCRP). In OCRP, a node selects the set of eligible next hops based on the given constraints and the distance to the destination. It then sends the packet to all eligible next hops. The protocol is implemented in Contiki OS and emulated for TelosB motes using Cooja. We compare its performance against tree and directional flooding routing and show the advantages of our technique.},

However, physically moving the BSs is complicated and costly. In this paper, we propose a new scheme: virtually moving the BSs. We deploy an excessive number of BSs and adaptively re-select a subset of active BSs so as to emulate the physical movement. Beyond achieving high energy-efficiency, this scheme obviates the difficulties associated with physically moving the BSs. The challenges are (i) that the energy efficiency of BSs should be considered as well, in addition to that of the sensor nodes and (ii) that the number of candidate subset of active BSs is exponential with the number of BSs. We show that scheduling the virtual movement of BSs is NP-hard. Then, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed under mild conditions to achieve a lifetime longer than 62% of the optimal one. In practice, as verified through extensive numerical simulations, the lifetime achieved by the proposed algorithm is always very close to the optimum.},

In such systems, the operators match tasks and resources stored in queues, with the objective of maximizing the system utility of the matching reward profile, minus the average matching cost. This problem appears in many practical systems and the main challenges are the no-underflow constraints, and the lack of matching-reward information and system dynamics statistics. We develop two online matching algorithms: Learning-aided Reward optimAl Matching (LRAM) and Dual-LRAM (DRAM) to effectively resolve both challenges. Both algorithms are equipped with a learning module for estimating the matching-reward information, while DRAM incorporates an additional module for learning the system dynamics. We show that both algorithms achieve an O(ε+δr) close-to-optimal utility performance for any ε>0, while DRAM achieves a faster convergence speed and a better delay compared to LRAM, i.e., O(δz/ε + log(1/ε)2/))delay and O(δz/ε) convergence under DRAM compared to O(1/ε) delay and convergence under LRAM (δr and δz are maximum estimation errors for reward and system dynamics). Our results reveal that information of different system components can play very different roles in algorithm performance and provide a systematic way for designing joint learning-control algorithms for dynamic systems.},

Existing MU-MIMO protocols strive to maximize DoF usage by serving M users simultaneously. In this paper, through a MU-MIMO testbed measurement, we found that the correlation between users' channels can severely compromise network throughput under a DoF-maximizing strategy. To combat this problem, we propose Kardia that judiciously distributes the DoF to least-correlated users within an AP's cell, and coordinates neighboring APs such that each can serve the best set of users while nulling mutual interference. The key challenge in Kardia lies in efficiently determining which set of users to serve without knowing the channel state from all of them. We propose a lightweight mechanism that enables APs to collaboratively infer the correlation between users through precoded probing packets. Our analysis shows that Kardia's DoF distribution framework has a provable performance guarantee. Our testbed implementation further reveals that Kardia can significantly boost the performance of multi-cell MU-MIMO networks, in contrast to legacy protocols like 802.11ac.},

 abstract = {Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has been widely used in applications such as inventory control, object tracking, supply chain management. An important research is to estimate the number of tags in a certain area covered by readers. This paper extends the research in both temporal and spatial dimensions to provide much richer information for monitoring the dynamics of distributed RFID systems. More specifically, we are interested in estimating the joint properties of any two snapshots taken at arbitrary locations and arbitrary times in a system. With many practical applications, there is however little prior work on this problem. We propose a joint RFID estimation protocol based on a simple yet versatile snapshot construction. Given the snapshots of any two tag sets, although their sizes may be very different, we design a way to combine their information and more importantly derive formulas to extract the joint properties of the two tag sets from the combined information, with an accuracy that can be arbitrarily set. Through formal analysis, we determine the optimal system parameters that minimize the execution time of taking snapshots, under the constraints of a given accuracy requirement. Our simulation results show that the proposed protocol can reduce the execution time by multifold when comparing with the best alternative approach in the literature.},

 abstract = {Monitoring breathing rates and patterns helps in the diagnosis and potential avoidance of various health problems. Current solutions for respiratory monitoring, however, are usually invasive and/or limited to medical facilities. In this paper, we propose a novel respiratory monitoring system, UbiBreathe, based on ubiquitous off-the-shelf WiFi-enabled devices. Our experiments show that the received signal strength (RSS) at a WiFi-enabled device held on a person's chest is affected by the breathing process. This effect extends to scenarios when the person is situated on the line-of-sight (LOS) between the access point and the device, even without holding it. UbiBreathe leverages these changes in the WiFi RSS patterns to enable ubiquitous non-invasive respiratory rate estimation, as well as apnea detection. We propose the full architecture and design for UbiBreathe, incorporating various modules that help reliably extract the hidden breathing signal from a noisy WiFi RSS. The system handles various challenges such as noise elimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting abnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using off-the-shelf devices in a wide range of environmental conditions shows that it can estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute (bpm) error. In addition, UbiBreathe can detect apnea with more than 96% accuracy in both the device-on-chest and hands-free scenarios. This highlights its suitability for a new class of anywhere respiratory monitoring.},

 abstract = {To handle increased capacity demands, sophisticated MIMO-based transmission strategies, based on transmitter cooperation, have emerged. However, different types of users' channels (e.g., static vs mobile, stable vs dynamic channels) that make up today's enterprises, require different MIMO transmission strategies. With the wrong strategy, a user could even see a degradation in performance. Our overarching goal is to design and implement a framework, TRINITY, that can simultaneously cater to a heterogeneous mix of users, by intelligently combining a plurality of MIMO transmission strategies wherein the transmitters at different nodes can cooperate to deliver significant performance gains. Three key challenges that we address in building TRINITY are: (i) how to categorize users into channel profiles such that a single transmission strategy caters to the users of a profile, (ii) how to combine strategies to communicate with users of different profiles simultaneously, and (iii) what is the granularity of transmitter cooperation needed to balance efficiency with complexity. We implement and evaluate TRINITY on our WARP radio testbed. Our extensive experiments show that TRINITY's intelligent combining of transmission strategies improves the total network rate by 50%-150%, satisfies the QoS requirements of thrice as many users, and improves PSNR for video traffic by 10 dB compared to individual transmission strategies.},

Minimum length multicast tree can be modeled as the Steiner Tree Problem, and is proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we explore how to efficiently generate minimum length multicast trees in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where only limited knowledge of network topology is available at each node. We design and analyze a simple and distributed algorithm, which we call Toward Source Tree (TST), to build multicast trees in WSNs. We show three metrics of TST algorithm, i.e., running time, tree length and energy efficiency. We prove that its running time is O(√nlog n), the best among all existing solutions to our best knowledge. We prove that TST tree length is in the same order as Steiner tree, give a theoretical upper bound and use simulations to show the ratio between them is only 1.114 when nodes are uniformly distributed. We evaluate energy efficiency in terms of the number of forwarding nodes in multicast trees, and prove that it is order-optimal. We give an efficient way to construct multicast tree in support of transmission of voluminous data.},

 abstract = {Different from previous works, in this paper, we adopt D2D communication as a routing extension to traditional cellular uplinks thus enabling a two-hop route between a user and the serving BS via a D2D relay. Specifically, a BS establishes a cellular link with a mobile user only if the pilot signal strength received from the user is above a specified threshold; otherwise, the user may establish a D2D link with a neighboring user and connect to a nearby BS in a two-hop manner. We present a stochastic geometry based framework to analyze the coverage probability and average rate in such a two-hop multi-channel uplink cellular network where mobile users adopt the fractional channel inversion power control with maximum transmit power limit. As validated by extensive numerical results, the developed framework enables network designers to efficiently determine the optimal control parameters so as to achieve the optimum system performance. Our results show that employing D2D link based two-hop connection can significantly improve both the network coverage and average rate for uplink traffic.},

 abstract = {Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) composed of commodity mobile devices have the potential to support communication applications resistant to blocking and censorship, as well as certain types of surveillance. We analyze the performance and energy consumption of such a network, and consider the impact of random and targeted denial-of-service and censorship attacks. To gather wireless connectivity traces for a DTN composed of human-carried commodity smartphones, we implemented and deployed a prototype DTN-based micro-blogging application, called 1am, in a college town. We analyzed the system during a time period with 111 users. Although the study provided detailed enough connectivity traces to enable analysis, message posting was too infrequent to draw strong conclusions based on user-initiated messages, alone. We therefore simulated more frequent message initiations and used measured connectivity traces to analyze message propagation. Using a flooding protocol, we found that with an adoption rate of 0.2% of a college town's student and faculty population, the median one-week delivery rate is 85% and the median delivery delay is 13 hours. We also found that the network delivery rate and delay are robust to denial-of service and censorship attacks eliminating more than half of the participants. Using a measurement-based energy model, we also found that the DTN system would use less than 10.0% of a typical smartphone's battery energy per day in a network of 2,500 users.},

This conference continues with the great success of the previous editions. ACM MobiHoc is well recognized as a premier international forum for researchers, practitioners and students for discussions on emerging challenges from mobile networking, computing, and systems. It covers topics ranging from fundamental theory, to technology issues, to applications and system development. To align with the conference vision, the Technical Program Committee has assembled a strong and diverse program, covering a wide range of technical topics, hoping to influence the direction of a broad spectrum of wireless networking research. This year we received 211 submissions from countries covering all the world regions. Under the guidance of the TPC Co-Chairs, the technical program committee and the reviewers provided outstanding work. Each of the submitted papers, except the early rejected papers due to violation of the rule of anonymity, received, on average, three to four in-depth reviews from Program Committee members, and the process was completed by a TPC review with a recommendation of acceptance/reject/TPC-discussion. The first round review and discussion led by TPC-lead recommended 7 papers for direct acceptance. Based on the TPC recommendation and the review scores, 60 papers were selected for TPC meeting held on May 23, 2014, in Chicago. These papers are randomly grouped into two groups with consideration of balance of paper review scores and avoiding TPC conflict of interests. Extensive discussions of these papers were held among TPC members to advise the TPC Chairs of accepted papers for the program. Only 33 papers were accepted from the TPC meeting. Total 40 papers are included in the final program as regular papers. Due to the large number of submissions, many high quality papers, unfortunately, could not be included in the conference program. Overall, the final program is excellent and diverse, and covers both fundamental issues as well as emerging topics. The ACM MobiHoc 2014 technical program, in addition to ten technical sessions, consists of three keynote talks, a panel on full-duplex communication chaired by Dr. Ness Shroff, a poster session, a demo session, and a demo pitch session. It is our great pleasure and privilege to invite three worldknown researchers, Dr. Farnam Jahanian from NSF, Dr. Joao Barros from University of Porto, and Dr. Roger Wattenhofer from ETH to give three keynote talks on various interesting and timely topics. In addition to the main conference program, seven workshops will be held together with the conference on August 11, 2014.},

In this paper, we study loop-free backpressure routing policies that forward packets along directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to avoid the looping problem. These policies use link reversal algorithms to improve the DAGs in order to support any achievable traffic demand. For a network with a single commodity, we show that a DAG that supports a given traffic demand can be found after a finite number of iterations of the link-reversal process. We use this to develop a joint link-reversal and backpressure routing policy, called the loop free backpressure (LFBP) algorithm. This algorithm forwards packets on the DAG, while the DAG is dynamically updated based on the growth of the queue backlogs. We show by simulations that such a DAG-based policy improves the delay over the classical backpressure routing policy. We also propose a multicommodity version of the LFBP algorithm, and via simulation we show that its delay performance is better than that of backpressure.},

 abstract = {In geographic routing protocols, face forwarding is often used in helping a packet escape from the stuck state. To guarantee packet delivery, face forwarding usually routes a packet in a planar subgraph of the network, which might disable many edges in the network and, in turn, worsen the routing performance and reduce the link failure tolerance. In this paper, we aim to improve the connectivity of the graphs on which face forwarding can guarantee packet delivery. We present a sufficient condition for the packet delivery guarantee of GFG face forwarding, augment the graph used in face forwarding with selected disabled edges in the network, and propose a geographic routing protocol, termed GFG-NP, in which a packet escapes from the stuck state by performing GFG face forwarding on the augmented graph that might be non-planar. We show, using theoretical analysis, that GFG-NP guarantees packet delivery when performed on the augmented graphs of the partial Delaunay triangulation (PDT) and the CLDP-stable graph constructed by the cross-link detection protocol (CLDP), termed PDT- and CLDP-augmented graphs, respectively. In addition, simulations on network simulator NS-2 show that GFG-NP with face forwarding performed on PDT- and CLDP-augmented graphs outperforms GFG with face forwarding performed on PDT and the CLDP-stable graph, respectively, in terms of load balance, path length, routing latency, and packet delivery rate.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, it is prohibitive for apps market places, such as Google App Store, to thoroughly verify an app's resource permission requests to be legitimate or malicious. As a result, mobile users are left to decide for themselves whether an app is safe to use or not. To assist users to make correct decisions as for whether to accept a permission request or not, we propose RecDroid. RecDroid is a crowdsourcing recommendation framework that collects apps' permission requests and users' responses to those requests, from which an experts ranking algorithm is used to seek expert users in the system and a recommendation algorithm is used to suggest appropriate responses to permission requests (accept or reject) based on experts' responses. In this demo, we demonstrate a user case to show how the RecDroid system assists users in permission control. We also explain the major principles and processes behind that support the RecDroid recommendation system.},
