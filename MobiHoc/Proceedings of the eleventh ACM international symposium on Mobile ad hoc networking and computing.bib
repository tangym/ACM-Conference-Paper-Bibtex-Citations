 abstract = {Recent popularization of personal hand-held mobile devices makes it important to characterize the mobility pattern of mobile device users, so as to accurately predict user mobility in the future. Currently, the user mobility pattern is mostly characterized at a coarse-grained level, in the form of transition among wireless Access Points (APs). There is limited research effort on the fine-grained characterization of geographical user movement. In this paper, we present a novel approach to characterize the steady-state and transient-state user mobility behaviors at a fine-grained level, based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation of user mobility. By applying our approach on both realistic mobility traces and synthetic mobility scenarios, we show that our approach is effective in characterizing user mobility pattern and making accurate mobility prediction. We also experimentally demonstrate that fine-grained user mobility knowledge is more effective to improve the performance of a variety of mobile computing applications.},

 abstract = {With the next generation cellular networks making a transition towards smaller cells, two-hop OFDMA relay networks have become a dominant, mandatory component in the 4G standards (WiMAX 802.16j, 3GPP LTE-Adv). While unicast flows have received reasonable attention in two-hop OFDMA relay networks, not much light has been shed on the design of efficient scheduling algorithms for multicast flows, thereby forming the focus of this work. We show that while relay cooperation is critical for improving multicast performance, it must be carefully balanced with the ability to multiplex multicast sessions and hence maximize aggregate multicast flow. To this end, we highlight strategies that carefully group relays for cooperation to achieve this balance. We then solve the multicast scheduling problem under two OFDMA sub-channelization models. We establish the NP-hardness of the scheduling problem even for the simpler model and provide efficient algorithms with approximation guarantees under both models. Evaluation of the proposed solutions reveals the efficiency of the scheduling algorithms as well as the significant benefits obtained from the multicasting strategy.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of preserving generated data in a sensor network in case of node failures. We focus on the type of node failures that have explicit spatial shapes such as circles or rectangles (e.g., modeling a bomb attack or a river overflow). We consider two different schemes for introducing redundancy in the network, by simply replicating data or by using erasure codes, with the objective to minimize the communication cost incurred to build such data redundancy. We prove that the problem is NP-hard using either replication or coding. We design Oα-approximation centralized and distributed algorithms for the two redundancy schemes, where α is the "fatness" of the potential node failure events. Using erasure codes, data distribution can be handled in an efficient distributed manner. Simulation results show that by exploiting the spatial properties of the node failure patterns, one can substantially reduce the communication cost compared to the resilient data storage schemes in the prior literature.},

 abstract = {An inherent limitation of the existing digital wireless network coding is that the relay node has to settle for a single broadcast rate for the coded packet transmission. Since the selected rate should be supported on the worst quality links to the intended receivers, the throughput gain by network coding is essentially bound to the capacity of the worst link. Worse yet, the bottleneck capacity diminishes as the diversity of links increases, which generally happens when the nodes participating in network coding operation grow in number. In this paper, we solve this "broadcast bottleneck" by using a novel symbol-level network coding scheme called Rate Diverse Network Coding (RDNC). With RDNC, the relay node can deal with receivers under disparate channel conditions with a single coded data stream, eliminating the single-rate broadcast bottleneck. Through extensive simulation, we find that RDNC significantly boosts the coding gain and the throughput, more when the given topology provides richer opportunities for coding. Specifically, RDNC is as good as COPE in the worst case, but can achieve up to 2.5 times the coding gain if the network topology permits.},

Our study, from the viewpoint of end users, covers virtually all possible mobile scenarios in urban areas, including subways, trains, off-shore ferries and city buses. We have confirmed that mobility has largely negative impacts on the performance of HSPA networks, as fast-changing wireless environment causes serious service deterioration or even interruption. Meanwhile our field experiment results have shown unexpected new findings and thereby exposed new features of the mobile HSPA networks, which contradict commonly held views. We surprisingly find out that mobility can improve fairness of bandwidth sharing among users and traffic flows. Also the triggering and final results of handoffs in mobile HSPA networks are unpredictable and often inappropriate, thus calling for fast reacting fallover mechanisms. We have conducted in-depth research to furnish detailed analysis and explanations to what we have observed. We conclude that mobility is a double-edged sword for HSPA networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public report on a large scale empirical study on the performance of commercial mobile HSPA networks.},

 abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the emergence of shared sensor networks as integrated infrastructure for multiple applications. It is important to allocate multiple applications in a shared sensor network, in order to maximize the overall Quality of Monitoring (QoM) subject to resource constraints (e.g., in terms of memory and network bandwidth). The resulting constrained optimization problem is a difficult and open problem since it is discrete, nonlinear, and not in closed-form. This paper makes several important contributions towards optimal multi-application allocation in shared sensor networks. (1) We formulate the optimal application allocation problem for a common class of distributed sensing applications whose QoM can be modeled as variance reduction functions. (2) We prove key theoretical properties of the optimization problem, including the monotonicity and submodularity of the variance reduction functions and the multiple knapsack structure of constraints; (3) By exploiting these properties, we propose a local search algorithm, which is efficient and has a good approximation bound, for application allocation in shared sensor networks. Simulations based on both real-world datasets and randomly generated networks demonstrate that our algorithm is competitive against simulated annealing in term of QoM, with up to three orders of magnitude reduction in execution times, making it a practical solution towards multi-application allocation in shared sensor networks.},

Using the tool of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP), we develop a comprehensive framework where we expand the solution space from predetermined trajectories to policies that can map ferry observations to navigation actions dynamically. Under this framework, we present an optimal and several efficient heuristic policies. We compare the proposed policies with predetermined control through analysis and simulations with respect to multiple node mobility parameters including speed, locality, activeness, and range of movement. The comparisons show a significant performance gain of up to twice the contact rate in cases of high uncertainty. In cases of low uncertainty, we give a sufficient condition under which predetermined control is optimal.},

Their wireless transmission, processing and storage capabilities enable them to support the full automation of many inventory management functions in the industry. This paper studies the practically important problem of monitoring a large set of RFID tags and identifying the missing ones - the objects that the missing tags are associated with are likely to be missing, too. This monitoring function may need to be executed frequently and therefore should be made efficient in terms of execution time, in order to avoid disruption of normal inventory operations. Based on probabilistic methods, we design a series of missing-tag identification protocols that employ novel techniques to reduce the execution time. Our best protocol reduces the time for detecting the missing tags by 88.9% or more, when comparing with existing protocols.},

 abstract = {A typical wireless sensor network consists of many small sensors that collect instrument data around their locations and forward it to a central location for data processing. These networks can be deployed to monitor livestock and agricultural assets, products in a store, patients in a hospital, and so on. In many cases sensors have to be densely deployed, and collisions or overhead due to collision avoidance will considerably degrade the system performance below an application's required levels. With the decreasing cost of radio devices the obvious solution to this problem is the use of multiple receivers on different radio channels. However, we show that if receivers can be placed in different locations then increasing the number of receivers on a single channel will increase the rate of the capture effect and decrease collision losses, while also increasing the fairness of the transmitters' radio links. Not only can this single channel approach be more effective than using multiple channels, it is also required for some techniques, such as localization, where each receiver must be able to detect a transmission from any transmitter. We also show that the optimal choice between these two solutions is influenced by the radio attenuation rate and the number of receivers in the system.},

While recent analysis of mobile networks focused on the process governing node encounters ("contacts"), this model is not particularly suitable for gathering behavior. In this paper, we propose a model of stochastic coalescence (merge) and fragmentation (split) of clusters. We implement this process as a Markov chain and derive analytically the exact stationary distribution of cluster size. Further, we prove that, as the number of nodes grows, the clustering behavior converges to a mean field, which is obtained as a closed-form expression. This expression translates the empirical merge and split rate of a scenario, a microscopic property, to an important macroscopic property - the cluster size distribution - with surprising accuracy. We validate all results with synthetic as well as real-world mobility traces from conference visitors and taxicabs with several thousand nodes.},

 abstract = {In cognitive radio networks (CRN), primary users can lease out their unused bandwidth to secondary users in return for a fee. We study price competition in a CRN with multiple primaries and e secondaries in a region, where each primary tries to attract secondaries by setting a lower price for his bandwidth than other primaries. A CRN has two distinctive features, which makes the price competition very different from that in traditional commodity markets. First, in every slot, each primary may or may not have unused bandwidth available. So primaries are uncertain about the number of other primaries from whom they face competition. Second, spectrum is a commodity that allows spatial reuse: the same band can be simultaneously used at far-off locations without interference; on the other hand, simultaneous transmissions at neighboring locations on the same band interfere with each other. As a result, a primary cannot offer bandwidth at all locations, but must select an independent set of locations at which to offer it. Also, the choice of the independent set and the prices at those locations must be made jointly. We formulate price competition in a CRN as a game, taking into account both bandwidth uncertainty and spatial reuse. We analyze the game in a single slot, as well as its repeated version. In each case, we not only prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium, but also explicitly compute it. The expressions we obtain provide interesting insights into how the price competition evolves for different values of the system parameters. Moreover, for the game in a single slot, we prove the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the class of symmetric equilibria.},

 abstract = {Clients in wireless networks may have per-packet delay constraints on their traffic. Further, in contrast to wireline networks, the wireless medium is subject to fading. In such a time-varying environment, we consider the system problem of maximizing the total utility of clients, where the utilities are determined by their long-term average rates of being served within their delay constraints. We also allow for the additional fairness requirement that each client may require a certain minimum service rate. This overall model can be applied to a wide range of applications, including delay-constrained networks, mobile cellular networks, and dynamic spectrum allocation. We address this problem through convex programming. We propose an on-line scheduling policy and prove that it is utility-optimal. Surprisingly, this policy does not need to know the probability distribution of system states. We also design an auction mechanism where clients are scheduled and charged according to their bids. We prove that the auction mechanism restricts any selfish client from improving its utility by faking its utility function. We also show that the auction mechanism schedules clients in the same way as that done by the on-line scheduling policy. Thus, the auction mechanism is both truthful and utility-optimal. Finally, we design specific algorithms that implement the auction mechanism for a variety of applications.},

 abstract = {In geographic (or geometric) routing, messages are expected to route in a greedy manner: the current node always forwards a message to its neighbor node that is closest to the destination. Despite its simplicity and general efficiency, this strategy alone does not guarantee delivery due to the existence of local minima (or dead ends). Overcoming local minima requires nodes to maintain extra non-local state or to use auxiliary mechanisms. We study how to facilitate greedy forwarding by using a minimum amount of such non-local state in topologically complex networks. Specifically, we investigate the problem of decomposing a given network into a minimum number of Greedily Routable Components (GRC), where greedy routing is guaranteed to work. We approach it by considering an approximate version in a continuous domain, with a central concept called the Greedily Routable Region (GRR). A full characterization of GRR is given concerning its geometric properties and routing capability. We then develop simple approximate algorithms for the problem. These results lead to a practical routing protocol that has a routing stretch below 7 in a continuous domain, and close to 1 in several realistic network settings},

It distinguishes itself from previous work with a combination of three features: (1) it works for networks in both 2D and 3D spaces, possibly containing holes or concave regions; (2) it is anchor-free, and uses only connectivity information to faithfully recover the original network topology, up to scaling and rotation; (3) it does not depend on the knowledge of network boundaries, which suits it well to situations where boundaries are difficult to identify. The key idea of CATL is to discover the notch nodes, where shortest paths bend and hop-count-based distance starts to significantly deviate from the true Euclidean distance. An iterative protocol is developed that uses a em notch-avoiding multilateration mechanism to localize the network. Simulations show that CATL achieves accurate localization results with a moderate per-node message cost.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we study jointly the problems of rate control and contention resolution in multi-cell WLANs based on the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol in the presence of hidden terminals. We adopt the network utility maximization (NUM) framework to formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem. Unlike previous approaches that require maximal weight scheduling or target simple MAC protocols without hidden terminals, our problem formulation considers a realistic IEEE 802.11-based MAC layer model. The resulting formulation being non-convex, we propose a simple scheme to transform this non-convex problem into a convex one. We derive a simple distributed algorithm to solve the problem via Lagrangian dual decomposition. Our algorithm does not require exchanges of topology or spatial information about the mobile clients between APs. Practical issues like random backoff, carrier sensing, frame retransmission and optimal contention window (CW) setting are considered in our design. The effectiveness, accuracy and convergence speed of our analytically derived algorithm are verified via numerical experiments and simulations.},

 abstract = {This paper studies feedback resource allocation in the downlink of a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) multichannel wireless system. We consider a downlink network with a single base station, L shared channels and N mobile users. Throughput optimal algorithms like the MaxWeight scheduling in general require the complete channel state information (with N × L link states) for scheduling, which could be unaffordably expensive when the number of users is large. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the base station allocates only limited uplink resource for acquiring channel state information. We first show that to support a fraction (1 - ε) of the full throughput region (the throughput region with full channel state information), the base station needs to acquire at least Θ(L) link states at each time slot. We then propose a Weight Based Feedback allocation, named WBF, and show that WBF together with the MaxWeight scheduling achieves a fraction (1 - ε) of the full throughput region by acquiring at most Θ(L log 1 ⁄ ε) link states per time slot.},

 abstract = {We investigate the scalability of a class of algorithms that exploit the dynamics of wireless fading channels to achieve secret communication in a large wireless network of n randomly located nodes. We describe a construction in which nodes transmit artificial noise to suppress eavesdroppers whose locations are unknown and ensure secrecy of messages transported across the network. Under a model in which eavesdroppers operate independently and under appropriate conditions on the achievable per-node throughput Ψ(n), we show that the network can tolerate Ω((1⁄√n(n))2c) eavesdroppers while ensuring that the aggregate rate at which eavesdroppers intercept packets goes to 0, where c is a constant such that 0 < c < 1. The result clearly establishes a trade-off between the achievable throughput and the allowable number of eavesdroppers. Under a collaborating eavesdropper model and a similar constraint on the eavesdropper throughput, we show that the network can tolerate a single eavesdropper with Ω((ln 1⁄√n(n))1ε) antennas, ∀ε > 0. We also establish sufficient conditions on the number of eavesdroppers to achieve a non-zero throughput in our construction.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a fundamental understanding regarding the effect that transmitting power has on the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks. Under the assumption that all interference is essentially regarded as noise, we carry out a quantitative analysis from the perspective of information theory. First, we answer the question, "How much information can be carried per unit bandwidth over a wireless ad hoc network under a certain power assignment and nodal distribution?" We then prove that the maximum network capacity, whether in bps (bits per second) or in bmps (bit-meters per second), strictly increases with respect to the total transmitting power under a fixed-proportion assignment, and that there is a limit as the total transmitting power goes to infinity. We further conclude that the maximum power efficiency, whether in bpJ (bits per Joule) or in bmpJ (bit-meters per Joule), strictly decreases with respect to the total transmitting power under a fixed-proportion assignment. We also show that the maximum network capacity, whether in bps or in bmps, follows an O(n) scaling law, where n is the number of nodes, which coincides with previous asymptotic conclusions. Finally, we highlight the practical implications of the results for power allocation, power assignment, and transmission scheduling. The contributions of this paper may be worthy of consideration by wireless network designers.},

 abstract = {We present the Whirlpool Routing Protocol (WARP), which efficiently routes data to a node moving within a static mesh. The key insight in WARP's design is that data traffic can use an existing routing gradient to efficiently probe the topology, repair the routing gradient, and communicate these repairs to nearby nodes. Using simulation, controlled testbeds, and real mobility experiments, we find that using the data plane for topology maintenance is highly effective due to the incremental nature of mobility updates. WARP leverages the fact that converging flows at a destination make the destination have the region of highest traffic. We provide a theoretical basis for WARP's behavior, defining an "update area" in which the topology must adjust when a destination moves. As long as packets arrive at a destination before it moves outside of the update area, WARP can repair the topology using the data plane. Compared to existing protocols, such as DYMO and HYPER, WARP's packet drop rate is up to 90% lower while sending up to 90% fewer packets.},

In this paper, we introduce a quality of monitoring (QoM) metric defined by the expected number of active users monitored, and investigate the problem of maximizing QoM by judiciously assigning sniffers to channels based on knowledge of user activities in a multi-channel wireless network. Two capture models are considered. The first one, called the user-centric model assumes frame-level capturing capability of sniffers such that the activities of different users can be distinguished. The second one, called the sniffer-centric model only utilizes binary channel information (active or not) at a sniffer. For the user-centric model, we show that the implied optimization problem is NP-hard, but a constant approximation ratio can be attained via polynomial complexity algorithms. For the sniffer-centric model, we devise a stochastic inference scheme that transforms the problem into the user-centric domain, where we are able to apply our polynomial approximation algorithms. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme and algorithms is further evaluated using both synthetic data as well as real-world traces from an operational WLAN.},

Prior works in static sensor environments show that constructing sensor barriers with random sensor deployment can be effective for intrusion detection. In response to the recent surge of interest in mobile sensor applications, this paper studies the intrusion detection problem in a mobile sensor network, where it is believed that mobile sensors can improve barrier coverage. Specifically, we focus on providing k-barrier coverage against moving intruders. This problem becomes particularly challenging given that the trajectories of sensors and intruders need to be captured. We first demonstrate that this problem is similar to the classical kinetic theory of gas molecules in physics. We then derive the inherent relationship between barrier coverage performance and a set of crucial system parameters including sensor density, sensing range, sensor and intruder mobility. We examine the correlations and sensitivity from the system parameters, and we derive the minimum number of mobile sensors that needs to be deployed in order to maintain the k-barrier coverage for a mobile sensor network. Finally, we show that the coverage performance can be improved by an order of magnitude with the same number of sensors when compared with that of the static sensor environment},

As the number of participants grows, bidder collusion becomes a serious threat. In this paper, we study bidder collusion in large-scale spectrum auctions, investigating its impact on auction outcomes. We found that the nature of the complex interference constraints among bidders provides a fertile breeding ground for colluders, causing significant damage in auction efficiency and revenue. In particular, collusion group of small size plays a dominant role since it is easy to form and hard to be detected. We propose Athena, a new collusion-resistant auction framework for large-scale dynamic spectrum auction. Athena implements a soft collusion resistance, allowing the auctioneer to exploit the tradeoff between the level of collusion resistance and the cost of achieving such level of resistance. Unlike existing solutions, Athena enables spectrum reuse across bidders, achieves soft collusion resistance against any form of collusive bidding strategy, maintains provable revenue guarantee, and does so with polynomial-time complexity. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we first analytically prove Athena's collusion resistance and revenue guarantee (under any bids), and then experimentally verify our analytical conclusions using empirical bid distributions.},

 abstract = {Present broadcast approaches for wireless multihop networks distribute packets quickly to all nodes (i.e., with low latency) by constructing small broadcast trees, thereby reducing the number of forwarding transmissions. While these trees are sufficient in non-fading environments, we show that they have a low delivery rate under fading. As a solution, we (1) incorporate the Rayleigh fading model directly into tree construction to re-obtain complete distribution with high probability. To still achieve low latency at the same time, we combine transmissions at individual nodes to exploit cooperation diversity. Since in broadcasts, a packet has to be retransmitted by nodes along the tree anyway, we do not have to pay the multiplexing loss which hampers cooperation diversity in the unicast case. Thus, we (2) additionally exploit cooperation diversity during tree construction to gain improved reliability while still keeping the size of the tree low. This enables us to significantly decrease the time for broadcasts while still distributing packets to all nodes under fading with high probability. To justify our heuristic approach, we (3) show that finding minimum latency cooperative broadcasts is NP-complete.},

 abstract = {Barrier coverage is a critical issue in wireless sensor networks for various battlefield and homeland security applications. The goal is to effectively detect intruders that attempt to penetrate the region of interest. A sensor barrier is formed by a connected sensor cluster across the entire deployed region, acting as a "trip wire" to detect any crossing intruders. In this paper we study how to efficiently improve barrier coverage using mobile sensors with limited mobility. After the initial deployment, mobile sensors can move to desired locations and connect with other sensors in order to create new barriers. However, simply moving sensors to form a large local cluster does not necessarily yield a global barrier. This global nature of barrier coverage makes it a challenging task to devise effective sensor mobility schemes. Moreover, a good sensor mobility scheme should efficiently improve barrier coverage under the constraints of available mobile sensors and their moving range. We first explore the fundamental limits of sensor mobility on barrier coverage and present a sensor mobility scheme that constructs the maximum number of barriers with minimum sensor moving distance. We then present an efficient algorithm to compute the existence of barrier coverage with sensors of limited mobility, and examine the effects of the number of mobile sensors and their moving ranges on the barrier coverage improvement. Both the analytical results and performance of the algorithms are evaluated via extensive simulations.},

We consider descriptors based on the differences in the mean, standard deviation, and histogram comparison. In close to 1000 mobility events we conducted, our approach delivers perfect recall and near perfect precision for detecting mobility at a granularity of a few seconds. It is robust to the movement of dummy objects near the transmitter as well as people moving within the room. The detection is successful because true mobility causes fast fading, while environmental mobility causes shadow fading, which exhibit considerable difference in signal distributions. The ability to produce good detection accuracy throughout the experiments also demonstrates that our approach can be applied to varying room environments and radio technologies, thus enabling novel security, health care, and inventory control applications.},
