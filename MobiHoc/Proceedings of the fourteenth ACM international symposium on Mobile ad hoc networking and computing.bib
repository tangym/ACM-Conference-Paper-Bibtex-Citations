 abstract = {Cognitive radio allows radio devices to access the idle spectrum opportunistically, thus alleviates the huge demand for spectrum. Rendezvous, where two radios complete handshaking in an idle channel, is a key step for cognitive radios to start communication. Radios may have the same (homogeneous) or different (heterogeneous) spectrum sensing capabilities. Currently, there is a "gap" between the rendezvous algorithms for homogeneous and heterogeneous cognitive radios---existing homogeneous algorithms incur high delay when applied to heterogeneous radios; while heterogeneous algorithms incur high congestion when applied to homogeneous radios. Since mixtures of these two types of radios appear commonly in practice, it is crucial to bridge the gap between the respective rendezvous algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new rendezvous algorithm, named the ICH scheme, for arbitrary mixtures of radios with homogeneous or heterogeneous spectrum sensing capabilities. Rigorous analysis and extensive simulations are conducted and show that ICH is the first rendezvous scheme that guarantees rendezvous for arbitrary mixtures of homogeneous and heterogeneous radios without incurring large delay and congestion.},

Opportunistic communications satisfy well the communication requirements of these applications, because they naturally incorporate context. Recently, an opportunistic communication paradigm called "Floating Content" (FC) was proposed, to support infrastructure-less, distributed content sharing. But how good is floating content in supporting context-aware applications? In this work, we present a simple approximate analytical model for the performance analysis of context-aware applications that use floating content. We estimate the "success probability" for a representative category of context-aware applications, and show how the system can be configured to achieve the application's target QoS. We validate our model using extensive simulations under different settings and mobility patterns, showing that our model-based predictions are highly accurate under a wide range of conditions.},

To make such a technology work effectively, a vehicle is needed to carry a charger to travel inside the network. On the other hand, it has been well recognized that a mobile base station offers significant advantages over a fixed one. In this paper, we investigate an interesting problem of co-locating the mobile base station on the wireless charging vehicle. We study an optimization problem that jointly optimizes traveling path, stopping points, charging schedule, and flow routing. Our study is carried out in two steps. First, we study an idealized problem that assumes zero traveling time, and develop a provably near-optimal solution to this idealized problem. In the second step, we show how to develop a practical solution with non-zero traveling time and quantify the performance gap between this solution and the unknown optimal solution to the original problem.},

Our current approaches to understand and predict epidemics rely on the scarce, but exact/reliable, expert diagnoses. This paper proposes a different way forward: use more readily available but also more noisy data with {\em many false negatives and false positives}, to determine the causative network of an epidemic. Specifically, we consider an epidemic that spreads according to one of two networks. At some point in time we see a small random subsample (perhaps a vanishingly small fraction) of those infected, along with an order-wise similar number of false positives. We derive sufficient conditions for this problem to be detectable, and provide an efficient algorithm that solves the hypothesis testing problem. We apply this model to two settings. In the first setting, we simply want to distinguish between random illness (a complete graph) and an epidemic (spread along a structured graph). In the second, we have a superposition of both of these, and we wish to detect which is the strongest component.},

QMF is the most recently introduced of the three, and although it was shown in theory to approximately achieve the capacity of arbitrary wireless networks, its performance in practice had not been evaluated. We present in this work experimental results---to the best of our knowledge, the first ones---that compare QMF, AF and DF in a realistic indoor setting. We find that QMF is a competitive scheme to the other two, offering in some cases up to 12% throughput benefits and up to 60% improvement in frame error-rates over the next best scheme.},

 abstract = {Rate adaptation in WiFi networks has received significant attention recently. However, most existing work focuses on selecting the rate to maximize throughput. How to select a data rate to minimize energy consumption is an important yet under-explored topic. This problem is becoming increasingly important with the rapidly increasing popularity of MIMO deployment, because MIMO offers diverse rate choices (e.g., the number of antennas, the number of streams, modulation, and FEC coding) and selecting the appropriate rate has significant impact on power consumption. In this paper, we first use extensive measurement to develop a simple yet accurate energy model for 802.11n wireless cards. Then we use the models to drive the design of energy-aware rate adaptation scheme. A major benefit of a model-based rate adaptation is that applying a model allows us to eliminate frequent probes in many existing rate adaptation schemes so that it can quickly converges to the appropriate data rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using trace-driven simulation and real implementation in a wireless testbed.},

However, the existing OR protocols cannot meet all the requirements for high-speed, multi-rate wireless mesh networks, including: running on commodity Wi-Fi interface, supporting TCP, low complexity, supporting multiple link layer data rates, and exploiting partial packets. In this paper, we propose Practical Opportunistic Routing (POR), a new OR protocol that meets all above requirements. The key features of POR include: packet forwarding based on a per-packet feedback mechanism, block-based partial packet recovery, multi-hop link rate adaptation, and a novel path cost calculation which enables good path selection by considering the ability of nodes to select appropriate data rates to match the channel conditions. We implement POR within the Click modular router and our experiments in a 16-node wireless testbed confirm that POR achieves significantly better performance than the compared protocols for both UDP and TCP traffic.},

Each packet is associated with a deadline and will be dropped if it is not transmitted before the deadline expires. The number of packet arrivals in each time slot and the length of a deadline are both stochastic and follow certain distributions. We only allow a fraction of packets to be dropped. At each link, we assume the link keeps track of the difference between the minimum number of packets that need to be delivered and the number of packets that are actually delivered, which we call deficit. The largest-deficit-first (LDF) policy schedules links in descending order according to their deficit values, which is a variation of the largest-queue-first (LQF) policy for non-real-time traffic. We prove that the efficiency ratio of LDF can be lower bounded by a quantity that we call the real-time local-pooling factor (R-LPF). We further prove that given a network with interference degree β, the R-LPF is at least 1/(β+1), which in the case of the one-hop interference model translates into an R-LPF of at least 1/3.},

 abstract = {While the increasing scales of the recent WSN deployments keep pushing a higher demand on the network throughput, the 16 orthogonal channels of the ZigBee radios are intensively explored to improve the parallelism of the transmissions. However, the interferences generated by other ISM band wireless devices (e.g., WiFi) have severely limited the usable channels for WSNs. Such a situation raises a need for a spectrum utilizing method more efficient than the conventional multi-channel access. To this end, we propose to shift the paradigm from discrete channel allocation to continuous frequency allocation in this paper. Motivated by our experiments showing the flexible and efficient use of spectrum through continuously tuning channel center frequencies with respect to link distances, we present FAVOR (Frequency Allocation for Versatile Occupancy of spectRum) to allocate proper center frequencies in a continuous spectrum (hence potentially overlapped channels, rather than discrete orthogonal channels) to nodes or links. To find an optimal frequency allocation, FAVOR creatively combines location and frequency into one space and thus transforms the frequency allocation problem into a spatial tessellation problem. This allows FAVOR to innovatively extend a spatial tessellation technique for the purpose of frequency allocation. We implement FAVOR in MicaZ platforms, and our extensive experiments with different network settings strongly demonstrate the superiority of FAVOR over existing approaches.},

In the multi-hop CRNs consisting of SUs as relays, such spectrum mobility will cause the invalidity of pre-determined routes of data flows since some of the channels pre-assigned to the routes become unavailable. In this paper, we investigate the spectrum-mobility-incurred route-switching problem in both spatial and frequency domains for CRNs, where the spatial switching determines which relays and links should be re-selected and the frequency switching decides which channels ought to be re-assigned to the spatial routes. We further formulate the route-switching problem as the Route-Switching Game which is shown to be a potential game and has a pure Nash Equilibrium (NE). Accordingly, an efficient algorithm for finding the NE is proposed. The proposed route-switching scheme not only avoids conflicts with PUs but also mitigates spectrum congestion. Meanwhile, tradeoffs between routing costs and channel switching costs are achieved.},

Based on how keys are managed in the system, the privacy preserving tag authentications proposed in the past can be categorized into tree-based and group-based approaches. While a tree-based approach achieves high performance in key authentication, it suffers from the issue of low privacy should a fraction of tags be compromised. On the contrary, while group-based key authentication is relatively invulnerable to compromise attacks, it is not scalable to the large number of tags.

Deterministic approaches verify them one by one, and the communication overhead and time cost grow linearly with increasing size of tags. We design a fine-grained batch authentication scheme, INformative Counting (INC), which achieves sublinear authentication time and communication cost in batch verifications. INC also provides authentication results with accurate estimates of the number of counterfeiting tags and genuine tags, while previous batch authentication methods merely provide 0/1 results indicating the existence of counterfeits. We conduct detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to examine this design and the results show that INC significantly outperforms previous work in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.},

Most of previous work put their focus on the information propagation in static network. In this work, we examine two closely related problems on information propagation in predicable DTN. In particular, we assume that during a certain time period, the interacting process among nodes is known a priori or can be predicted. The first problem is to select a set of initial source nodes, subject to budget constraint, in order to maximize the total weight of nodes that receive the information at the final stage. This problem is well-known influence maximization problem which has been extensively studied for static networks. The second problem we want to study is minimum cost initial set problem, in this problem, we aim to select a set of source nodes with minimum cost such that all the other nodes can receive the information with high probability. We conduct extensive experiments using $10,000$ users from real contact trace.},

 abstract = {Recent studies on MAC scheduling have shown that carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) algorithms can be throughput optimal for arbitrary wireless network topology. However, these results are highly sensitive to the underlying assumption on `static' or `fixed' system conditions. For example, if channel conditions are time-varying, it is unclear how each node can adjust its CSMA parameters, so-called backoff and channel holding times, using its local channel information for the desired high performance. In this paper, we study `channel-aware' CSMA (A-CSMA) algorithms in time-varying channels, where they adjust their parameters as some function of the current channel capacity. First, we show that the achievable rate region of A-CSMA equals to the maximum rate region if and only if the function is exponential. Furthermore, given an exponential function in A-CSMA, we design updating rules for their parameters, which achieve throughput optimality for an arbitrary wireless network topology. They are the first CSMA algorithms in the literature which are proved to be throughput optimal under time-varying channels. Moreover, we also consider the case when back-off rates of A-CSMA are highly restricted compared to the speed of channel variations, and characterize the throughput performance of A-CSMA in terms of the underlying wireless network topology. Our results not only guide a high-performance design on MAC scheduling under highly time-varying scenarios, but also provide new insights on the performance of CSMA algorithms in relation to their backoff rates and underlying network topologies.},

 abstract = {To support high data rate applications such as multimedia streaming, the ongoing standardization of the next generation Wi-Fi increases the channel bonding from 40 MHz in 802.11n to 80, and even 160 MHz under certain conditions in 802.11ac. However, inefficiency and unfairness issues arise when devices that use different channel widths coexist in a contention domain. A device with channel bonding has to wait until all bonded channels to be idle to commence a transmission while narrow channel interferers have more channel access opportunities. To address the inefficiency and unfairness issues in channel bonding, we propose an adaptive channel bonding (ACB) protocol in which a node is allowed to initiate a transmission as long as a narrow channel is available and gradually increase channel width during transmission whenever a new narrow channel becomes available. ACB aggregates all available narrow channels as one wide channel, removing the need of setting guard bands between contiguous narrow channels. A challenge in the design is the communication over uncertain channels. To enable fast spectrum agreement between transmitter and receiver, a partial spectrum correlation method is introduced. ACB also considers the severe contention in a wide band of spectrum. When new channels become available, multiple nodes may contend for them. A compound preamble is designed to make collisions detectable in the frequency domain and a parallel bitwise arbitration mechanism is introduced to quickly resolve the collisions in the time domain. We implemented and evaluated the ACB through the GNU Radio/USRP platform. Experimental results show that ACB can well address the inefficiency and unfairness issues caused by heterogeneous radio coexistence.},

Although a diversity of GPS-less and GPS-free solutions have been developed recently for autonomous localization in wireless sensor networks, they primarily target at 2D planar or 3D volumetric settings. There exists unique and fundamental hardness to extend them to 3D surface. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, it proposes a theoretically-proven algorithm for the 3D surface localization problem. Seeing the challenges to localize general 3D surface networks and the solvability of the localization problem on single-value (SV) surface, this work proposes the {\em cut-and-sew} algorithm that takes a divide-and-conquer approach by partitioning a general 3D surface network into SV patches, which are localized individually and then merged into a unified coordinates system. The algorithm is optimized by discovering the minimum SV partition, an optimal partition that creates a minimum set of SV patches. Second, it develops practically-viable solutions for real-world sensor network settings where the inputs are often noisy. The proposed algorithm is implemented and evaluated via simulations and experiments in an indoor testbed. The results demonstrate that the proposed cut-and-sew algorithm achieves perfect 100% localization rate and the desired robustness against measurement errors.},

Aiming to develop a systematic understanding of the interplay between social structure and mobile communications, in this paper we exploit social ties in human social networks to enhance cooperative device-to-device communications. Specifically, as hand-held devices are carried by human beings, we leverage two key social phenomena, namely social trust and social reciprocity, to promote efficient cooperation among devices. With this insight, we develop a coalitional game theoretic framework to devise social-tie based cooperation strategies for device-to-device communications. We also develop a network assisted relay selection mechanism to implement the coalitional game solution, and show that the mechanism is immune to group deviations, individually rational, and truthful. We evaluate the performance of the mechanism by using real social data traces. Numerical results show that the proposed mechanism can achieve up-to 122% performance gain over the case without D2D cooperation.},

 abstract = {By taking advantage of active sensing using radio waves, radar sensors can offer several advantages over passive sensors. Although much recent attention has been given to multistatic and MIMO radar concepts, little has been paid to understanding the performance of radar networks (i.e., multiple individual radars working in concert). In this context, we study the optimal placement of a bistatic radar (BR) sensor network for barrier coverage. The coverage problem in a bistatic radar network (BRN) is challenging because: 1) in contrast to the disk sensing model of a traditional passive sensor, the sensing region of a BR depends on the locations of both the BR transmitter and receiver, and is characterized by a Cassini oval; 2) since a BR transmitter (or receiver) can potentially form multiple BRs with different BR transmitters (or receivers, respectively), the sensing regions of different BRs are coupled, making the coverage of a BRN highly non-trivial. This paper considers the problem of deploying a network of BRs in a region for maximizing the worst-case intrusion detectability, which amounts to minimizing the vulnerability of a barrier. We show that the shortest barrier-based placement is optimal if the shortest barrier is also the shortest line segment connecting the region's two boundaries. Based on this observation, we study the optimal placement of the BRs on a line segment for minimizing its vulnerability, which is a non-convex optimization problem. By exploiting some specific structural properties pertaining to the problem (particularly an important structure of detectability), we find the optimal placement order and the optimal placement spacing of the BR nodes, both of which exhibit elegant balanced structures. Our findings give valuable insight for the placement of BRs for barrier coverage. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to explore the coverage of a network of BRs.},

 abstract = {Developing scheduling mechanisms that can simultaneously achieve throughput optimality and good delay performance often require solving the Maximum Independent Weighted Set (MWIS) problem. However, under most realistic network settings, the MWIS problem can be shown to be NP-hard. In non-fading environments, low-complexity scheduling algorithms have been provided that converge either to the MWIS solution in time or to a solution that achieves at least a provable fraction of the achievable throughput. However, in more practical systems the channel conditions can vary at faster time-scales than convergence occurs in these lower-complexity algorithms. Hence, these algorithms cannot take advantage of the opportunistic gain, and may no longer guarantee good performance. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity scheduling scheme that performs provably well under fading channels and is amenable to implement in a distributed manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheduling scheme under fading environments that requires only local information, has a low complexity that grows logarithmically with the network size, and achieves provable performance guarantees (which is arbitrarily close to that of the well-known centralized Greedy Maximal Scheduler). Through simulations we verify that both the throughput and the delay under our proposed distributed scheduling scheme are close to that of the optimal solution to MWIS. Further, we implement a preliminary version of our algorithm in a testbed by modifying the existing IEEE 802.11 DCF. The preliminary experiment results show that our implementation successfully accounts for wireless fading, and attains the opportunistic gains in practice, and hence substantially outperforms IEEE 802.11 DCF.},

The likelihood functions of the hypotheses are often not known in advance, and decision rules have to be learned via supervised learning. A specific learning algorithm is Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), the classification accuracy of which has been previously studied in the context of wireless sensor networks. Previous work, however, does not take into account the communication protocol or battery lifetime; in this paper we extend existing studies by proposing a model that captures the relationship between battery lifetime and classification accuracy. To do so, we combine the FDA with a model that captures the dynamics of the carrier-sense multiple-access (CSMA) algorithm, the random-access algorithm used to regulate communications in sensor networks. This allows us to study the interaction between the classification accuracy, battery lifetime and effort put towards learning, as well as the impact of the back-off rates of CSMA on the accuracy. We characterize the tradeoff between the length of the training stage and accuracy, and show that accuracy is non-monotone in the back-off rate due to changes in the training sample size and overfitting.},

 abstract = {Small cells form a critical component of next generation cellular networks, where spatial reuse is the key to higher spectral efficiencies. Interference management in the spatial domain through beamforming allows for increased reuse without having to sacrifice resources in the time or frequency domain. Existing beamforming techniques for spatial reuse, being coupled with client scheduling, face a key limitation in practical realization, especially with OFDMA small cells. In this context, we argue that for a practical spatial reuse system with beamforming, it is important to decouple beamforming from client scheduling. Further, we show that jointly addressing client association with beamforming is critical to maximizing the reuse potential of beamforming. Towards our goal, we propose ProBeam -- a practical multi-cell beamforming system for reuse in small cell networks. ProBeam incorporates two key components - a low complexity, highly accurate SINR estimation module that helps determine interference dependencies for beamforming between small cells; and an efficient, low complexity joint client association and beam selection algorithm for the small cells that accounts for scheduling at the small cells without being coupled with it. We have prototyped ProBeam on a WiMAX-based network of four small cells. Our evaluations reveal the accuracy of our SINR estimation module to be within 1 dB, and the reuse gains from joint client association and beamforming to be as high as 115% over baseline approaches.},

 abstract = {Previous works usually simplify the network area as a disk, a square or a torus without obstacles. However, geometry in practical environment is much more intricate. Rectilinear communication between nodes is often blocked by external surroundings, such as buildings and mountains. Complicated shapes of the obstacles may cause the computation intractable. In this paper, we propose a characteristic function of connectivity to capture the geometric features of an ad-hoc network. The function can be expressed as power series, of which the orders and coefficients is based on the characteristics of the network. We formulate the shapes with fundamental factors and investigate their algebraic impact on connectivity. The critical transmission range is also calculated to mitigate the influence of obstacles.},

 abstract = {We consider the design of throughput-optimal scheduling policies in multi-hop wireless networks that also possess good mean delay performance and provide regular service for all links -- critical metrics for real-time applications. To that end, we study a parametric class of maximum-weight type scheduling policies with parameter α ≥ 0, called Regular Service Guarantee (RSG) Algorithm, where each link weight consists of its own queue-length and a counter that tracks the time since the last service. This policy has been shown to be throughput-optimal and to provide more regular service as the parameter α increases, however at the cost of increasing mean delay. This motivates us to investigate whether satisfactory service regularity and low mean-delay can be simultaneously achieved by the RSG Algorithm by carefully selecting its parameter α. To that end, we perform a novel Lyapunov-drift based analysis of the steady-state behavior of the stochastic network. Our analysis reveals that the RSG Algorithm can minimize the total mean queue-length to establish mean delay optimality under heavily-loaded conditions as long as α scales no faster than the order of 1/5√∈, where ∈ measures the closeness of the network load to the boundary of the capacity region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides regular service to all links while also achieving heavy-traffic optimality in mean queue-lengths.},

 abstract = {We are pleased to present the proceedings of the 15th ACM International Symposium on Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking and Computing (ACM MobiHoc 2014), held in Philadelphia, PA, USA, from August 11 toAugust 14, 2014. This conference continues with the great success of the previous editions. ACM MobiHoc is well recognized as a premier international forum for researchers, practitioners and students for discussions on emerging challenges from mobile networking, computing, and systems. It covers topics ranging from fundamental theory, to technology issues, to applications and system development. To align with the conference vision, the Technical Program Committee has assembled a strong and diverse program, covering a wide range of technical topics, hoping to influence the direction of a broad spectrum of wireless networking research. This year we received 211 submissions from countries covering all the world regions. Under the guidance of the TPC Co-Chairs, the technical program committee and the reviewers provided outstanding work. Each of the submitted papers, except the early rejected papers due to violation of the rule of anonymity, received, on average, three to four in-depth reviews from Program Committee members, and the process was completed by a TPC review with a recommendation of acceptance/reject/TPC-discussion. The first round review and discussion led by TPC-lead recommended 7 papers for direct acceptance. Based on the TPC recommendation and the review scores, 60 papers were selected for TPC meeting held on May 23, 2014, in Chicago. These papers are randomly grouped into two groups with consideration of balance of paper review scores and avoiding TPC conflict of interests. Extensive discussions of these papers were held among TPC members to advise the TPC Chairs of accepted papers for the program. Only 33 papers were accepted from the TPC meeting. Total 40 papers are included in the final program as regular papers. Due to the large number of submissions, many high quality papers, unfortunately, could not be included in the conference program. Overall, the final program is excellent and diverse, and covers both fundamental issues as well as emerging topics. The ACM MobiHoc 2014 technical program, in addition to ten technical sessions, consists of three keynote talks, a panel on full-duplex communication chaired by Dr. Ness Shroff, a poster session, a demo session, and a demo pitch session. It is our great pleasure and privilege to invite three worldknown researchers, Dr. Farnam Jahanian from NSF, Dr. Joao Barros from University of Porto, and Dr. Roger Wattenhofer from ETH to give three keynote talks on various interesting and timely topics. In addition to the main conference program, seven workshops will be held together with the conference on August 11, 2014.},

 abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used to monitor the physical environment. In a highly redundant sensor network, sensor readings from nearby sensors often have high similarity. In this work, we are interested in how to decide an appropriate sensing rate for each sensor node, in order to maximize the overall Quality-of-Monitoring (QoM), while ensuring that all readings can be transmitted to the sink. Note that a feasible sensing rate allocation should satisfy both energy constraint on each sensor node and flow conservation through the network. In order to capture the statistical correlations among sensor readings, we first introduce the concept of correlation graph. The correlation graph is further decomposed into several correlation components, and sensor readings from the same correlation component are highly correlated. For each correlation component, we defined a general utility function to estimate the QoM. The utility function of each correlation component is a non-decreasing submodular function of the total sensing rates allocated to that correlation component. Then we formulate the QoM-aware sensing rate allocation problem as a utility maximization problem under limited power supply on each node. To tackle this problem, we adopted an efficient algorithm, called Qute, by jointly considering both the energy constraint on each node and flow conservation through the network. Under some settings, we analytically show that Qute can find the optimal QoM-aware sensing rate allocation which achieves the maximum total utility. We conducted extensive testbed verifications of our schemes, and experimental results validate our theoretical results.},

This structure provides a realistic representation of a variety of network scenarios with obstacles and, at the same time, allows a simple enough analysis, which is partly based on percolation theory and partly based on geometric properties. We propose three different ways of modeling the geometric part of the network and derive analytical bounds for the connectivity probability and the critical transmission range for connectivity in the network. Finally, we present extensive simulations that demonstrate that our analytical results provide good approximations, especially for high density scenarios.},

This paper analyzes a localized KPD based on the Transversal Design (TD) design or Reed Solomon (RS) codes schemes; later two shown to be similar. They lack full direct communications among their constituent nodes and so, rely on multi-hop involving other nodes reducing the overall efficiency of the system. The communication issue for TD or RS and hence the localized KPD gets resolved by Deterministic Merging of exactly two nodes. The weakness of `selective node attack' of the merged designs, similar to their original KPDs, is overcome by invoking the novel trick of Sarkar \emph{et al.} Simulation results confirm that the various network parameters of the proposed schemes improves significantly over a random counterpart among other existing schemes.},

After receiving bid requests from secondary users, and possibly reserve price from primary users, our goal is to design truthful mechanisms that will either optimize the social efficiency or optimize the revenue of the primary user. As computing an optimal conflict-free spectrum allocation is an NP-hard problem, in this work, we design near optimal spectrum allocation mechanisms separately based on the techniques: derandomized allocation from integer programming formulation, and its linear programming (LP) relaxation. We theoretically prove that 1) our derandomized allocation methods are monotone, thus, implying truthful auction mechanisms; 2) our derandomized allocation methods can achieve a social efficiency or a revenue that is at least $1-\frac{1}{e}$ times of the optimal respectively; Our extensive simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the problem of serving multiple live video streams to several different clients from a single access point over unreliable wireless links, which is expected to be major a consumer of future wireless capacity. This problem involves two characteristics. On the streaming side, different video streams may generate variable-bit-rate traffic with different traffic patterns. On the network side, the wireless transmissions are unreliable, and the link qualities differ from client to client. In order to alleviate the above stochastic aspects of both video streams and link unreliability, each client typically buffers incoming packets before playing the video. The quality of the video playback subscribed to by each flow depends, among other factors, on both the delay of packets as well as their throughput. In this paper we address how to schedule packets at the access point to satisfy the joint per-packet-delay-throughput performance measure. We test the designed policy on the traces of three movies. From our tests, it appears to outperform other policies by a large margin.},

@inproceedings{Zhou:2013:DDT:2491288.2491296,
 abstract = {A wireless sensor network can be represented by a graph. While the network graph is extremely useful, it often exhibits undesired irregularity. Therefore, special treatment of the graph is required by a variety of network algorithms and protocols. In particular, many geometry-oriented algorithms depend on a type of subgraph called Delaunay triangulation. However, when location information is unavailable, it is nontrivial to achieve Delaunay triangulation by using connectivity information only. The only connectivity-based algorithm available for Delaunay triangulation is built upon the property that the dual graph for a Voronoi diagram is a Delaunay triangulation. This approach, however, often fails in practical wireless sensor networks because the boundaries of Voronoi cells can be arbitrarily short in discrete sensor network settings. In a sensor network with connectivity information only, it is fundamentally unattainable to correctly judge neighboring cells when a Voronoi cell boundary is less than one hop. Consequently, the Voronoi diagram-based Delaunay triangulation fails. The proposed algorithm employs a distributed approach to perform centroidal Voronoi tessellation, and constructs its dual graph to yield Delaunay triangulation. It exhibits several distinctive properties. First, it eliminates the problem due to short cell boundaries and thus effectively avoids crossing edges. Second, the proposed algorithm is proven to converge and succeed in constructing a Delaunay triangulation, if the CVT cell size is greater than a constant threshold. Third, the established Delaunay triangulation consists of close-to-equilateral triangles, benefiting a range of applications such as geometric routing, localization, coverage, segmentation, and data storage and processing. Extensive simulations are carried out under various 2D network models to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CVT-based triangulation algorithm.},
