 abstract = {Maximum Vertex-weighted Matching (MVM) is an important link scheduling algorithm for multihop wireless networks. Under certain assumptions, it has been shown that if the underlying network graph is bipartite, MVM not only maximizes the throughput in settings with continuous packet arrivals, but also minimizes the evacuation time (i.e., time to drain all the initial packets) in settings without future packet arrivals. Further, even if the network graph is arbitrary, MVM achieves the best known performance guarantee for the evacuation time among existing online link scheduling algorithms. Also, it empirically exhibits close-to-optimal throughput performance and good delay performance. However, in an arbitrary network graph the throughput performance of MVM has not been well understood. To that end, in this paper we aim to carry out a systematic study of the throughput performance of MVM, assuming single-hop flows and the node-exclusive interference model. Inspired by the celebrated Gallai-Edmonds structure theorem, we introduce a novel topological notion, called the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition factor, and rigorously prove that the efficiency ratio of MVM is no smaller than the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition factor of the network graph. Further, we show that if the smallest size of an odd cycle in a graph is 2m + 1 for a positive integer m, then the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition factor is equal to 2m/(2m + 1). This implies that the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition factor is at least 2/3 for an arbitrary graph and is equal to 1 for bipartite graphs. Having these results, the throughput performance of MVM can be well characterized.},

 abstract = {Using optical sensors for indoor monitoring has been widely adopted in many smart building applications. An important design problem in this space is to explore the tradeoff between energy consumption and coverage quality. While it is important that the sensors achieve full coverage (i.e., every interesting target point can be monitored by at least one sensors), it is often a waste of energy to keep sensors on all the time as events are typically stochastic and rare and most of the time the sensors are on idle monitoring. In this paper we design efficient sensor duty cycles to ensure that any target point of interest is still covered sufficiently frequently while only a subset of sensors are kept on at any time slot. We denote by the maximum dark length for each target point p as the maximum duration in which p is covered at least once. We formulate two optimization problems: the min max dark length scheduling and the min average dark length scheduling. For both versions we provide efficient, practical algorithms with provable approximation guarantee. The two algorithms have been tested on two real testbed scenarios to evaluate its efficiency and coverage quality.},

Infrared signals are directional and reliable signals that have little interference with other electromagnetic signals that are commonly found in the deployment domain such as visible light and wireless radio waves. Since the angle of arrival is used, and line of sight is the main constraint for IR signals, we investigate the problem called robust guarding, i.e., placing emitters to ensure that all points of the domain are robustly covered by two emitters that are from sufficiently different directions. We prove combinatorial upper and lower bounds for the number of emitters needed and prove that finding the minimum number of guards is NP-hard. We show that n/2 guards are always sufficient and sometimes necessary for rectilinear polygons and we provide practical algorithms in general. We also developed a testbed with low cost off-the-shelf infrared (IR) emitters and sensors for indoor device-free localization. We tested the algorithms for using infrared sensors for indoor localization and our system achieves an average accuracy of 11.7 cm in a typical office setting.},

 abstract = {Real world wireless networks usually have diverse connectivity characteristics. Although existing works have identified replication as the key to the successful design of routing protocols for these networks, the questions of when the replication should be used, by how much, and how to distribute packet copies are still not satisfactorily answered. In this paper, we investigate the above questions and present the design of the Hybrid Routing Protocol (HRP). We make a key observation that delay correlations can significantly impact performance improvements gained from packet replication. Thus, we propose a novel model to capture the correlations of inter-contact times among a group of nodes. HRP utilizes both direct delays feedback and the proposed model to estimate the replication gain, which is then fed into a novel regret-minimization algorithm to dynamically decide the amount of packet replication under unknown network conditions. We evaluate HRP through extensive simulations. We show that HRP achieves up to 3.5x delivery ratio improvement and up to 50% delay reduction, with comparable and even lower overhead than state-of-art routing protocols.},

 abstract = {A full-duplex radio can transmit and receive simultaneously, and, hence, is a natural fit for realizing an in-band relay system. Most of existing full-duplex relay designs, however, simply forward an amplified version of the received signal without decoding it, and, thereby, also amplify the noise at the relay, offsetting throughput gains of full-duplex relaying. To overcome this issue, we explore an alternative: demodulate-and-forward. This paper presents the design and implementation of DelayForward (DF), a practical system that fully extracts the relay gains of full-duplex demodulate-and-forward mechanism. DF allows a relay to remove its noise from the signal it receives via demodulation and forward the clean signal to destination with a small delay. While such delay-and-forward mechanism avoids forwarding the noise at the relay, the half-duplex destination, however, now receives the combination of the direct signal from a source and the delayed signal from a relay. Unlike previous theoretical work, which mainly focuses on deriving the capacity of demodulate-and-forward relaying, we observe that such combined signals have a structure similar to the convolutional code, and, hence, propose a novel viterbi-type decoder to recover data from those combined signals in practice. Another challenge is that the performance of full-duplex relay is inherently bounded by the minimum of the relay's SNR and the destination's SNR. To break this limitation, we further develop a power allocation scheme to optimize the capacity of DF. We have built a prototype of DF using USRP software radios. Experimental results show that our power-adaptive DF delivers the throughput gain of 1.25×, on average, over the state-of-the-art full-duplex relay design. The gain is as high as 2.03× for the more challenged clients.},

 abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing has been considered as a promising approach for large scale urban data collection, but has also posed new challenging problems such as incentivization and quality control. Among the other incentivization approaches, posted pricing has been widely adopted by commercial systems due to the reason that it naturally achieves truthfulness and fairness and is easy to be implemented. However, the fundamental problem of how to set a right posted price in crowdsensing systems remains largely open. In this paper, we study a quality-aware Bayesian pricing problem for mobile crowdsensing where the users' sensing costs and qualities for participating in crowdsensing are drawn from known distributions learned from historical information, and our goal is to choose an appropriate posted price to recruit a group of participants with reasonable sensing qualities for robust crowdsensing, while the total expected payment is minimized. We show that our problem is NP-hard and has close ties with the well known Poisson Binomial Distributions (PBD). To solve our problem, we first discover some non-trivial submodular properties of PBD, which have not been reported before, then we propose a novel "ironing method" that transforms our problem from a non-submodular optimization problem into a submodular one by leveraging the newly discovered properties of PBD. Finally, with the ironing method, an approximate algorithm with provable performance ratio is provided, and we also conduct extensive numerical simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

 abstract = {Performance of modern cognitive and interactive mobile applications highly depends on the data transmission delay in the wireless link that is vital to supporting real-time wireless traffic. To eliminate wireless network congestion caused by large amounts of concurrent network traffic and support such real-time traffic, traditional schemes adopt various flow control and QoS-aware traffic scheduling techniques, but fail when the amount of network traffic further increases. In this paper, we present a novel design of high-throughput wireless side channel, which operates concurrently with the existing wireless network channel over the same spectrum but dedicates to real-time traffic. Our key idea of realizing such a side channel is to exploit the excessive SNR margin in the wireless network to encode data as patterned interference. We design such patterned interference in form of energy erasure over specific subcarriers in an OFDM-based wireless network, and achieve a data rate of 1.25 Mbps in the side channel without affecting the existing wireless network links. Experimental results over software-defined radio platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our side channel design in reducing the latency of real-time wireless traffic, while providing sufficient data throughput for such traffic.},

Short-term spectrum auctions can pave the way for dynamic LSA in the future and to create incentives for incumbents to voluntarily participate in the LSA model, thereby increase spectrum availability. Different from existing auction schemes that are mostly based on the sealed-bid auction format, we consider an ascending bid format which is theoretically equivalent to a sealed bid format but comes with better behavioral properties. We develop a novel auction mechanism called GAVEL that follows the ascending bid auction format and is well-suited for the dynamic LSA context. GAVEL, besides being strategy-proof, satisfies the three additional desirable properties of supporting heterogeneous spectrum, fine-grained spectrum sharing and bidder privacy protection. In fact, GAVEL is the first mechanism to satisfy all these properties. Through simulation-based evaluations, GAVEL is shown to outperform two recently proposed schemes in terms of revenue, social welfare, number of winners and achieving high spectrum utilization while at the same time performing close to the LP based optimal solution.},

 abstract = {A novel attack model is proposed against the existing wireless link-based source identification, which classifies packet sources according to the physical-layer link signatures. A link signature is believed to be a more reliable indicator than an IP or MAC address for identifying packet source, as it is generally harder to modify/forge. It is therefore expected to be a future authentication against impersonation and DoS attacks. However, if an attacker is equipped with the same capability/hardware as the authenticator to process physical-layer signals, a link signature can be easily manipulated by any nearby wireless device during the training phase. Based on this finding, we propose an attack model, called the analog man-in-the-middle (AMITM) attack, which utilizes the latest full-duplex relay technology to inject semi-controlled link signatures into authorized packets and reproduce the injected signature in the fabricated packets. Our experimental evaluation shows that with a proper parameter setting, 90% of fabricated packets are classified as those sent from an authorized transmitter. A countermeasure against this new attack is also proposed for the authenticator to inject link-signature noise by the same attack methodology.},

However, in applications such as remote monitoring of patients using mobile devices, data requirement of end users varies significantly depending upon their roles. The fixed chunking approach would lead to unnecessary data download due to the dynamic variability of data access. Also, the requests are more often than not based on fixed time chunks that do not necessarily translate to fixed data size. To overcome this challenge, we present a dynamic log chunking mechanism based on reader access pattern and domain specific data characteristics.

 abstract = {A coflow is a collection of related parallel flows that occur typically between two stages of a multi-stage compute task in a network, such as shuffle flows in MapReduce. The coflow abstraction allows applications to convey their semantics to the network so that application-level requirements (e.g., minimizing the completion time of the slowest flow) can be better satisfied. In this paper, we study the routing and scheduling of multiple coflows to minimize the average coflow completion time (CCT). We first propose a rounding-based randomized approximation algorithm, called OneCoflow, for single coflow routing and scheduling. The multiple coflow problem is more challenging as coexisting coflows will compete for the same network resources such as link bandwidths. To minimize the average CCT, we derive an online multiple coflow routing and scheduling algorithm, called OMCoflow, and prove that it has a reasonably good competitive ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online algorithm with theoretical performance guarantees which considers routing and scheduling simultaneously for multi-coflows. Compared with existing methods, OMCoflow runs more efficiently, and it avoids the problem of frequently rerouting the flows. Extensive simulations on a Facebook data trace show that OMCoflow outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic schemes significantly (e.g., reducing the average CCT by up to 41.8% and the execution time by up to 99.2% against RAPIER [28]).},

These problems arise from emerging networking applications where mobile chargers are dispatched to deliver energy to mobile agents (e.g., robots, drones, and vehicles), which have specified tasks and mobility patterns. We instantiate our work by focusing on finding the charging path maximizing the number of nodes charged within a fixed time horizon. We prove that this problem is APX-hard. By recursively decomposing the problem into sub-problems of searching sub-paths, we design a quasi-polynomial time algorithm that achieves poly-logarithmic approximation to the optimum charging path. Our approximation algorithm can be further adapted and extended to solve a variety of charging path optimization and scheduling problems with realistic constraints, such as limited time and energy budget.},

 abstract = {Gesture recognition has become increasingly important in human-computer interaction (HCI) and can support a broad array of emerging applications, such as smart home, virtual reality, and mobile gaming. Traditional approaches usually rely on dedicated sensors that are worn by the user or cameras that require line of sight. In this paper, we present fine-grained finger gesture recognition by using a single commodity WiFi device without requiring user to wear any sensors. Our low-cost system, WiFinger, takes advantages of the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) available from commodity WiFi devices and the prevalence of WiFi network infrastructures. It senses and identifies subtle movements of finger gestures by examining the unique patterns exhibited in the detailed CSI. In WiFigner, we devise environmental noise removal mechanism to mitigate the effect of signal dynamic due to the environment changes. Moreover, we propose to capture the intrinsic gesture behavior to deal with individual diversity and gesture inconsistency. Our experimental evaluation in both home and office environments demonstrates that our system can achieve over 93% recognition accuracy and is robust to both environment changes and individual diversity. Results also show that our system can work with WiFi beacon signals and provides accurate gesture recognition under NLOS scenarios.},

 abstract = {Interference in WiFi deployments is a growing problem due to the increasing popularity of WiFi. Therefore it is important that APs find the right channel to operate upon. Through a large scale measurement study involving over 10,000 WiFi APs we show that channel measurements and selection are most effective when performed frequently (every few minutes). This is because of the highly dynamic nature of WiFi traffic congestion. Our key contribution in this paper is a novel approach to distributed channel selection -- Ineffective time Quantum (IQ) Hopping, that is simple enough to be described in three lines and has provable optimality guarantees. IQ-Hopping does not require any explicit channel measurements and can react within a matter of several seconds to bad channel conditions, including microwave ovens, hidden interferers, or dynamically varying congestion. Through implementation and experiments on off-the-shelf WiFi routers (OpenWRT, MadWiFi), we demonstrate the effectiveness of IQ-Hopping.},

 abstract = {"Edge-clouds," which are small servers located close to mobile users, have the potential to greatly reduce delay and backhaul traffic of mobile applications by moving cloud services closer to users at the edge. Due to their limited storage capacity, proper configurations of edge-clouds have a significant impact on their performance. This paper proposes a tractable online algorithm that configures edge-clouds dynamically solely based on past system history without any assumptions on the arrival patterns of mobile applications. We evaluate the competitive ratio, which quantifies the worst-case performance in comparison to an optimal offline policy, of our policy. We prove that the competitive ratio of our policy is linear with the capacity of the edge-cloud. Moreover, we also prove that no deterministic online policy can achieve a competitive ratio that is asymptotically better than ours. The utility of our online policy is further evaluated by traces from real-world data centers. These trace-based simulations demonstrate that our policy has better, or similar, performance compared to many intelligent offline policies that have complete knowledge of all future arrivals.},

 abstract = {The enormous success of advanced wireless devices is pushing the demand for higher wireless data rates. The industry is satisfying this increasing demand by densely deploying large numbers of access points (APs). Unfortunately, unicast rates, especially in crowded scenarios, remain very low due to severe interference and time-sharing. However, one may take advantage of the broadcasting nature of wireless transmissions to offer high multicast rates. Motivated by this, we present coordinated broadcasting (Co-BCast), a system which coordinates multiple APs to provide participants of big events with high multicast rates that can support multiple high definition video streams. Co-BCast requires no complicated time or frequency synchronization and no instantaneous channel state information. Yet, despite the time and frequency offsets among concurrent transmitters, the aggregate signal from the coordinated APs offers uniform coverage and high SINR to all users. We explore the challenges of such asynchronous transmissions through theoretical analysis and wireless experiments on software defined radio (SDR) testbeds. We use a number of PHY techniques to address those challenges and implement our coordination scheme on top of an 802.11 reference design. Both wireless experiments and large-scale simulations demonstrate that Co-BCast can achieve multicast rates in the order of 100Mbps even in the most crowded scenarios. These rates are orders of magnitude higher than the unicast and multicast rates achieved by uncoordinated transmissions.},

However, as an infrastructure, WiFi APs are easily connected by some undesired users nearby. In this paper, we propose NiFi, a non-intrusive WiFi user identification system based on WiFi signals that enables AP to automatically identify legitimate users in indoor environment such as home, office and hotel. The core idea is that legitimate and undesired users may have different physical constraints, e.g., moving area, walking path, etc, leading to different signal sequences. NiFi analyzes and exploits the characteristics of signal sequences generated by mobile devices. NiFi proposes a practical and effective method to extract useful features and measure similarity for signal sequences, while not relying on precise user location information. We implement NiFi on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) APs, and the implementation does not require any modification to user devices. The experiment results demonstrate that NiFi is able to achieve an average identification accuracy at 90.83% with true positive rate at 98.89%.},

We consider core problem where a set of LTE-U cells from different operators share the same channel as a co-located WiFi access point (AP). We assume that LTE-U cells utilize Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) as the default channel access mechanism. Principally, we deal with the following question: how should an operator's LTE-U cell adjust its contention window in order to provide a fair coexistence both with WiFi and co-located LTE-U cells of other operators? We consider that LTE-U cells behave altruistically both among themselves and to WiFi. Cooperation of LTE-U cells is studied using a coalition formation game framework which is based on the well-known Shapley value. We define a payoff configuration scheme in the coalition game which involves altruism. We prove that the coalitional game is always zero-monotonic, and Shapley value is also max-min fair. We compare airtime sharing performance of Shapley value with weighted proportional fairness via numerical results and show that Shapley value provides much better fairness than proportional fairness as determined by entropy and Jain's index metrics while having roughly equal average airtime.},

 abstract = {Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has been widely adopted by real-world industries. This paper presents a new application for distributively deployed RFID systems, wherein a user chooses multiple tag sets at will from different spatial or temporal domains, and then connects them by set operators (union, intersection and relative complement) to form a set expression. The user is allowed to query for the cardinality of an arbitrary set expression, which is called the joint property of multiple sets. We focus on the problem of estimating the joint property with bounded error, which has many potential applications. One of them is to allow users to check the number of tags in an arbitrary tag flow passing through a distributed RFID system. For this problem, we propose a solution with a novel design that supports versatile snapshot construction: Given the snapshots of multiple tag sets, although their lengths may be very different, our formulas can estimate their joint properties, with an accuracy that can be arbitrarily set. For the proposed estimator, we formally analyze its bias and variance, and also the optimal settings of protocol parameters to minimize the time cost of taking a snapshot of a tag set. The simulation results show that, under predefined accuracy requirement, our solution can reduce time cost by multiple folds as compared with existing works named DiffEstm and CCF, which require all tag sets must be encoded into snapshots with an equal length.},

 abstract = {The popularity of digital currencies, especially cryptocurrencies, has been continuously growing since the appearance of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency protocol enabling transactions between individuals without the need of a trusted authority. Its network is formed from resources contributed by individuals known as miners. Users of Bitcoin currency create transactions that are stored in a specialised data structure called a block chain. Bitcoin's security lies in a proof-of-work scheme, which requires high computational resources at the miners. These miners have to be synchronised with any update in the network, which produces high data traffic rates. Despite advances in mobile technology, no cryptocurrencies have been proposed for mobile devices. This is largely due to the lower processing capabilities of mobile devices when compared with conventional computers and the poorer Internet connectivity to that of the wired networking. In this work, we propose LocalCoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that requires minimal computational resources, produces low data traffic and works with off-the-shelf mobile devices. LocalCoin replaces the computational hardness that is at the root of Bitcoin's security with the social hardness of ensuring that all witnesses to a transaction are colluders. It is based on opportunistic networking rather than relying on infrastructure and incorporates characteristics of mobile networks such as users' locations and their coverage radius in order to employ an alternative proof-of-work scheme. Localcoin features (i) a lightweight proof-of-work scheme and (ii) a distributed block chain.},

In recent years, ensemble clustering has been extensively studied and successfully applied to many areas. In this paper, we study a new variant of ensemble clustering, distributed ensemble clustering, motivated by the proliferation of networked sensing systems where communication is enabled between only connected nodes. Our goal is to aggregate the clustering solutions produced by the sensor nodes that observe the same set of objects. Different from traditional ensemble clustering problems, distributed ensemble clustering aims to achieve not only accurate clustering results, but also low communication cost among the nodes. To this end, we build a novel geometric optimization model that can be efficiently solved with theoretical quality guarantee. The proposed approach, bearing nice geometric properties, can be easily adapted to distributed settings without any sacrifice of clustering quality, and facilitates a dimension reduction procedure which can significantly reduce the communication complexity. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets. Experimental results suggest that our approach can efficiently solve the distributed ensemble clustering problem, and outperform the baselines on both clustering accuracy and communication cost.},

 abstract = {On behalf of the Technical Program Committee, we would like to welcome you to ACM MobiHoc 2015 in Hangzhou, China. ACM MobiHoc is the premier international symposium dedicated to addressing challenges emerging from wireless networking and computing. The highly selective technical program has traditionally brought together a unique blend of researchers and practitioners, thereby influencing the direction of a wide range of wireless networking research areas. We hope that you will find the conference intellectually stimulating. We are delighted to report that this year's program continues the tradition of excellence set by this conference over the years. We received 250 submissions, which has made it extremely challenging to select only 37 papers for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. At such a selective acceptance rate (14.8%) many of the papers that we could not accept are of high quality and we are certain that many of them will appear in the near future at other top-tier conferences. The paper selection process was handled by the Technical Program Committee (TPC). The TPC included 65 excellent members with expertise spanning all the major areas relevant to the conference scope. In particular, the TPC was composed of members from 16 countries and included 11 members from research labs and industry. The 250 submitted papers went through a first phase of reviews followed by a very active online discussion phase. Then, several papers went through a second review phase. The reviews were provided by the TPC members and, when needed, a few reviews were provided by external expert reviewers. At the end of this process and based on the results of the online discussion, 12 papers were accepted and 46 papers were further discussed at the TPC meeting that was held on Feb. 28, 2015 at Columbia University in New York. Following the discussions at the meeting, 25 additional papers were accepted. Ten of the accepted papers were assigned shepherds who volunteered to assist the authors during the process of preparing the final version. The work of the TPC was outstanding and we thank all the members for the time and efforts they dedicated to the paper selection process and to attending the meeting. These efforts make this wonderful conference possible. We are pleased with the strong technical program of the conference, represented by the papers in these proceedings. The conference program covers a wide range of topics, including routing, scheduling, algorithms, performance evaluation, dynamic spectrum access, cellular networks, sensor networks, mobile applications and crowdsensing, security, and wireless systems. This year's program is preceded by a set of seven workshops. It continues the tradition of having keynote talks from outstanding leaders in the field, and it includes a poster/demo session. The keynote speakers are Prof. Ness B. Shroff, the Ohio Eminent Scholar in Networking and Communications at The Ohio State University, Prof. Wen Gao, Vice President of the NSF of China, and Prof. Andrea Goldsmith, the Stephen Harris Professor in the School of Engineering, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.},

In this regard, encoding the video with high-quality encoder results in humongous increase in the data-rate. Given that users tend to focus more on certain parts of video, the region of video frame that is highly viewed is encoded with best-possible quality and the other regions are encoded with decreasing quality. However, the main challenge is to ensure that adaptive encoding does not result in significant perceivable degradation in video quality. In this 2-pager for poster, the nature of region of interest (RoI) is analyzed by identifying the user's focus while watching video captured with two different camera technology. It has been observed that user's RoI follows a Gaussian distribution from left to right of the screen. At the same time, the user's RoI from top to bottom follows a distribution that is almost Gaussian, but varies with the nature of the video content. This is a significant result that will play a key role in designing an adaptive RoI for reducing the data rate while transmitting multimedia content over the network.},

Our metric captures two important elements of smartness, i.e., being able to know what users want and pre-serve them, and achieving good resource management while doing so. We provide an explicit characterization of the system intelligence, and show that it is jointly determined by user demand volume (opportunity to impress), demand correlation (user predictability), and system resource and action costs (flexibility to pre-serve). We then propose an online learning-aided control algorithm called Learning-aided Budget-limited Intelligent System Control (LBISC). We show that LBISC achieves an intelligence level that is within O(N(T)-1/2 + ε) of the highest level, where N(T) represents the number of data samples collected within a learning period T and is proportional to the user population size in the system, while guaranteeing an O(max(N(T)-1/2/ε, log(1/ε)2)) average resource deficit. Moreover, we show that LBISC possesses an O(max(N(T)-1/2/ε log(1/ε)2)+T) convergence time, which is much smaller compared to the Θ(1/ε) time required for non-learning based algorithms. The analysis of LBISC rigorously quantifies the impact of data and user population (captured by N(T)), learning (captured by our learning method), and control (captured by LBISC) on the achievable system intelligence, and provides novel insight and guideline into designing future smart systems.},

 abstract = {In recent years, there have been significant efforts on the research and development of Massive MIMO (M-MIMO) technologies at the physical layer. So far, however, the understanding of how M-MIMO could affect the performance of network control and optimization algorithms remains rather limited. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the performance of the queue-length-based joint congestion control and scheduling framework (QCS) over M-MIMO cellular networks with limited channel state information (CSI). Our contributions in this paper are two-fold: i) We characterize the scaling performance of the queue-lengths and show that there exists a phase transitioning phenomenon in the steady-state queue-length deviation respect to the CSI quality (reflected in the number of bits B that represent CSI); and ii) We characterize the congestion control rate scaling performance and show that there also exists a phase transitioning phenomenon in steady-state congestion control rate deviation respect to the CSI quality. Collectively, the findings in this paper advance our understanding of the trade-offs between delay, throughput, and the accuracy/complexity of CSI acquisition in M-MIMO cellular network systems.},

However, disclosure of one's true value causes numerous security vulnerabilities. Moreover, as a distinguished property of spectrum auction compared to classical auctions, spectrum reutilisation requires that the bidder locations be disclosed to the auctioneer to run the auction. We investigate the impact of disclosing bidder locations and demonstrate that such disclosure can be exploited by a malicious auctioneer to gain extra profit and significantly degrade bidders' utility. We then design a provably secure spectrum auction framework that does not leak any information on either bids or bidder locations other than the auction outcome. Technically, we leverage tools in garbled circuits and secret sharing, and design data-oblivious algorithms where the execution path does not depend on the input. We further implement our solution and theoretically and experimentally show that it incurs only limited computation and communication overhead.},

 abstract = {The ever growing wireless bandwidth demand is pushing WiFi and cellular networks to dense multi-cell deployments, as well as to multi-tier architectures consisting of macrocells and small cells. In such a multi-tier multi-cell environment, the classic problem of associating users to base stations becomes both more challenging and more critical to the overall network performance. Most previous analytical work is focused on offline/static user-cell association, where the users' arrivals and their rates are assumed to be known in advance and thus has little practical relevance. On the other hand, practical online algorithms based on heuristics are often suboptimal and may not provide any performance guarantees. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm for the multi-tier multi-cell user association problem that has a provable performance guarantee which improves previously known bounds by a sizable amount. The proposed algorithm is motivated by online combinatorial auctions, while capturing and leveraging the relative sparsity of choices in wireless networks as compared to auction setups. Specifically, it is a 1/2−a−1 approximation algorithm, where a is the maximum number of feasible associations for a user and is, in general, small due to path loss. In addition to establishing formal performance bounds, we also conduct simulations under realistic assumptions which establish the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing approaches under real-world scenarios.},

The interaction of the campaign with users is realized through a mobile app interface that recommends tasks to users and offers them incentives. The main contribution is a novel perspective on the payment distribution problem faced by the crowdsensing campaign organizer in light of originally unknown individual user preferences. Contrary to common practice, we acknowledge that users exhibit high diversity in decision making because they assess differently attributes related to a task such as their proximity to the place of interest (PoI), the payment made for contributing data, or the task context/theme. We draw on logistic-regression techniques from machine learning to learn users' individual preferences from past data rather than hypothesizing about them. We then formulate non-linear (sigmoid) optimization problems to determine the tasks and incentives (payments) that should be optimally offered to each user. Our mechanism is validated against synthetic but also real data about the way users choose tasks, collected through an online questionnaire. It achieves very good approximations of the optimal solutions and substantially outperforms alternative preference-agnostic policies that do not exercise behavioral user profiling to target the provision of incentives.},

 abstract = {Centralized spectrum management is one of the key dynamic spectrum access (DSA) mechanisms proposed to govern the spectrum sharing between government incumbent users (IUs) and commercial secondary users (SUs). In the current centralized DSA designs, the operation data of both government IUs and commercial SUs needs to be shared with a central server. However, the operation data of government IUs is often classified information and the SU operation data may also be commercial secret. The current system design dissatisfies the privacy requirement of both IUs and SUs since the central server is not necessarily trust-worthy for holding such sensitive operation data. To address the privacy issue, this paper presents a privacy-preserving centralized DSA system (P2-SAS), which realizes the complex spectrum allocation process of DSA through efficient secure multi-party computation. In P2-SAS, none of the IU or SU operation data would be exposed to any snooping party, including the central server itself. We formally prove the correctness and privacy-preserving property of P2-SAS and evaluate its scalability and practicality using experiments based on real-world data. Experiment results show that P2-SAS can respond an SU's spectrum request in 6.96 seconds with communication overhead of less than 4 MB.},

We also provide near-optimal and heuristic algorithms that "convexify" the capacity region when it is not convex. The convexified region corresponds to a combination of a few full-duplex rates (i.e., to time sharing between different operation modes). The algorithms can be used for theoretical characterization of the capacity region as well as for resource (time, power, and channel) allocation with the objective of maximizing the sum of the rates when one of them (uplink or downlink) must be guaranteed (e.g., due to QoS considerations). We numerically illustrate the capacity regions and the rate gains (compared to time division duplex) for various channel and cancellation scenarios.

 abstract = {We consider the problem of throughput-optimal broadcasting in time-varying wireless network with an underlying Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology. Known broadcast algorithms route packets along pre-computed spanning trees. In large wireless networks with time-varying connectivities, the optimal trees are difficult to compute and maintain. In this paper we propose a new online throughput-optimal broadcast algorithm, which takes packet-by-packet scheduling and routing decisions, obviating the need for maintaining any global topological structures, such as spanning-trees. Our algorithm utilizes certain queue-like system-state information for making transmission decisions and hence, may be thought of as a generalization of the well-known back pressure algorithm, which makes point-to-point unicast transmission decisions based on local queue-length information. Technically, the back-pressure algorithm is derived by stabilizing the packet-queues. However, because of packet-duplications, the work-conservation principle is violated and appropriate queuing processes are difficult to define in the broadcast setting. To address this fundamental issue, we identify certain state-variables whose dynamics behave like virtual queues. By stochastically stabilizing these virtual queues, we devise a throughput-optimal broadcast policy. We also derive new characterizations of the broadcast-capacity of time-varying wireless DAGs and derive an efficient algorithm to compute the capacity exactly under certain assumptions, and a poly-time approximation algorithm for computing the capacity approximately under less restrictive assumptions.},

We devise proactive techniques to restore broken directional links with low overhead and design a mechanism to jointly adapt beamwidth and data rate, targeting throughput maximization that incorporates data rate, overhead for beam alignment, and mobility resilience.

 abstract = {One of the critical aspect in V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) communications is secured data transfer in real-time; and critically, data not being tampered by malicious infringing. In this context, this work aims to propose an integrated cryptographic technique obtained by combining asymmetric and symmetric techniques that would be suitable for V2V environment. This paper investigates the performance of different cryptographic techniques - RSA, ECC and El-Gamal - for real-time data transfer in V2V. Particularly, these three techniques are analyzed in terms of the time taken at the transmitter and at the receiver; for various message length. It is observed that the time taken by ECC is the least, while time taken by RSA is the highest. This provide a platform for evaluating integrated El-Gamal ECC mechanism and comparing it with other integrated asymmetric and symmetric algorithm.},

 abstract = {Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technologies have been widely used in many applications. Tag estimation, which is to estimate the cardinality of a single tag set, is an important research topic. This paper expands the estimation research as follows: It performs joint estimation between two tag sets, and more importantly the estimation is fine-grained in an effort to accommodate common practical scenarios, where each tag set consists of tags belonging to different categories. For any two given tag sets, we want to know the detailed information about the joint property of each category, instead of just the aggregate information of the whole sets. Furthermore, due to the open nature of RFID communications, it is often desirable that category-level joint estimation can be performed in an anonymous way without revealing the tags' IDs. To support these requirements, we develop a new technique called mask bitmap that can encode a tag set without requiring the tags to report their IDs or category IDs. Any two mask bitmaps that encode different tag sets can be combined to perform category-level joint estimation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed solution can yield accurate category-level estimates and preserve tags' anonymity.},

 abstract = {Recent studies in wireless scheduling have shown that CSMA can be made throughput optimal by optimizing over activation rates. However, those throughput optimal CSMA algorithms were found to suffer from poor delay performance, especially at high throughputs where the delay can potentially grow exponentially in the size of the network. Motivated by these shortcomings, in this paper we propose a node-based version of the throughput optimal CSMA (NB-CSMA) as opposed to previous link-based CSMA algorithms, where links were treated as separate entities. Our algorithm is fully distributed and corresponds to Glauber dynamics with "Block updates". We show analytically and via simulations that NB-CSMA outperforms conventional link-based CSMA in terms of delay for any fixed-size network. We also characterize the fraction of the capacity region for which the average queue lengths (and the average delay) grow polynomially in the size of the network, for networks with bounded-degree conflict graphs. This fraction is no smaller than the fraction known for link-based CSMA, and is significantly larger for a special class of wireless ad-hoc networks.},

 abstract = {In this paper we design throughput-optimal dynamic broadcast algorithms for multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies. Most of the previous broadcast algorithms route packets along spanning trees, rooted at the source node. For large time-varying networks, computing and maintaining a set of spanning trees is not efficient, as the network-topology may change frequently. In this paper we design a class of dynamic algorithms which make packet-by-packet scheduling and routing decisions and hence, obviate the need for maintaining any global topological structures, such as spanning trees. Our algorithms may be conveniently understood as a non-trivial generalization of the familiar back-pressure algorithm, which makes unicast packet routing and scheduling decisions, based on local queue-length information and does not require to maintain end-to-end paths. However, in the broadcast setting, due to packet duplications, it is hard to define appropriate queuing structures. We design and prove the optimality of a virtual-queue based algorithm, where virtual-queues are defined for subsets of nodes. We then propose a multi-class broadcast policy which combines the above scheduling algorithm with in-class-in-order packet forwarding, resulting in significant reduction in complexity. Finally, we evaluate performance of the proposed algorithms via extensive numerical simulations.},

 abstract = {One of the most important applications of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is to detect unknown tags brought by new tagged items moved in, misplacement, or counterfeit tags. While unknown tag identification is able to pinpoint all the unknown tags, probabilistic unknown tag detection is preferred in large-scale RFID systems that need to be frequently checked up, e.g., real-time inventory monitoring. Nonetheless, we find that the efficiency of most previous works is not well optimized due to the transmission of unhelpful data. In this paper, we propose a fast and reliable method for probabilistic unknown tag detection, White Paper (WP) protocol. The key novelty of WP is to build a composite message data structure that consists of all the informative data from several independent detection synopses, i.e., excluding the useless data from communication. Hence, this design allows us to optimize the detection and communication efficiency at the same time. In particular, the compact detection synopsis is designed and tuned to minimize the failure probability for detection and the detection message is compositely constructed to reduce the transmission overhead, achieving the optimal detection and communication efficiency, respectively. We implement a prototype system using USRP software-defined radio and WISP tags to show the feasibility of this design. We also conduct extensive simulations and comparisons to show that WP achieves more than 2x performance gain compared to the state-of-the-art protocols.},

 abstract = {In various online/offline networked environments, it is very popular that the system can benefit from coordinating actions of two interacting nodes, but incur some cost due to such coordination. Examples include a wireless sensor networks with duty cycling, where a sensor node consumes a certain amount of energy when it is awake, but a coordinated operation of sensors enables some meaningful tasks, e.g., sensed data forwarding, collaborative sensing of a phenomenon, or efficient decision of further sensing actions. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem that captures the amount of coordination gain at the cost of node activation over networks. This problem is challenging since the target utility is a function of the long-term time portion of the inter-coupled activations of two adjacent nodes, and thus a standard Lagrange duality theory is hard to apply to obtain a distributed decomposition as in the standard NUM (Network Utility Maximization). We propose a fully-distributed algorithm that requires only one-hop message passing. Our approach is inspired by a control of Ising model in statistical physics, and the proposed algorithm is motivated by a stochastic approximation method that runs a Markov chain incompletely over time, but provably guarantees its convergence to the optimal solution. We validate our theoretical findings on convergence and optimality through extensive simulations under various scenarios.},

 abstract = {WiFi data offloading provides a promising auxiliary to alleviate network congestion by diverting traffic from the cellular infrastructure onto WiFi access points (APs). Despite the importance and momentum of this method, the current deployment of APs by the carriers follows mostly a heuristic approach. In addition, the prevalent free-of-charge WiFi access approach may result in significant opportunity costs for the carriers as this traffic could yield non-negligible revenues. In this paper, we propose and study the problem of optimizing the deployment of WiFi offloading infrastructure, and pricing the offloading service with the goal of maximizing carrier profits. Addressing this problem is a prerequisite for the efficient integration of WiFi technology to next generation of cellular systems and the development of carrier-grade offloading solutions. Our framework considers a fundamental, intuitive model of carrier costs and revenues, and two demand models that predict how traffic will change in response to alteration in the price and the set of deployed APs. We present both analytical and approximate solutions for this intricate problem, and reveal how key network parameters shape the offloading benefits. Using a dataset of WiFi access patterns collected from real users, we evaluate the impact of offloading for different regional markets around the world. We find that in mature markets WiFi can help carriers reduce their costs, while charging users up to 50% lower than the cellular service. The gains are higher for small "virtual carriers" who resell other's mobile data services (up to a factor of 2). However, in less mature markets where the AP deployment or access costs are higher, deploying APs can actually lead to a net loss for the carrier. Our evaluation code is publicly available for the benefit of research community.},

A fundamental issue in such systems is to effectively incentivize worker participation. However, instead of being an isolated module, the incentive mechanism usually interacts with other components which may affect its performance, such as data aggregation component that aggregates workers' data and data perturbation component that protects workers' privacy. Therefore, different from past literature, we capture such interactive effect, and propose INCEPTION, a novel MCS system framework that integrates an incentive, a data aggregation, and a data perturbation mechanism. Specifically, its incentive mechanism selects workers who are more likely to provide reliable data, and compensates their costs for both sensing and privacy leakage. Its data aggregation mechanism also incorporates workers' reliability to generate highly accurate aggregated results, and its data perturbation mechanism ensures satisfactory protection for workers' privacy and desirable accuracy for the final perturbed results. We validate the desirable properties of INCEPTION through theoretical analysis, as well as extensive simulations.},
