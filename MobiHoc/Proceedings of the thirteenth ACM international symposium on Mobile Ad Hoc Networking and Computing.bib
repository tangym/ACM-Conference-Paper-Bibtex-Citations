 abstract = {Epidemic content dissemination in opportunistic social networks (OSN) has been analyzed in depth, theoretically and empirically. Most related works have studied the pairwise contact history among nodes in conference or campus environments. We claim that given the nature of these networks, this approach leads to a biased understanding of the content dissemination process. We design a methodology to break OSN traces down into 'temporal communities', i.e., groups of people who meet periodically during an experiment. We show that these communities correlate with people's social communities. As in previous works, we observe that efficient content dissemination is mostly due to high contact rate nodes. However, we show that high contact rate nodes that are more frequently involved in temporal communities contribute less to the dissemination process, leading us to conjecture that social communities tend to limit dissemination in OSNs.},

 abstract = {Real-time routing is a basic element of closed-loop, real-time sensing and control, but it is challenging due to dynamic, uncertain link/path delays. The probabilistic nature of link/path delays makes the basic problem of computing the probabilistic distribution of path delays NP-hard, yet quantifying probabilistic path delays is a basic element of real-time routing and may well have to be executed by resource-constrained devices in a distributed manner; the highly-varying nature of link/path delays makes it necessary to adapt to in-situ delay conditions in real-time routing, but it has been observed that delay-based routing can lead to instability, estimation error, and low data delivery performance in general. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Timescale Estimation (MTE) method; by accurately estimating the mean and variance of per-packet transmission time and by adapting to fast-varying queueing in an accurate, agile manner, MTE enables accurate, agile, and efficient estimation of probabilistic path delay bounds in a distributed manner. Based on MTE, we propose the Multi-Timescale Adaptation (MTA) routing protocol; MTA integrates the stability of an ETX-based directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) with the agility of spatiotemporal data flow control within the DAG to ensure real-time data delivery in the presence of dynamics and uncertainties. We also address the challenges of implementing MTE and MTA in resource-constrained devices such as TelosB motes. We evaluate the performance of MTA using the NetEye and Indriya sensor network testbeds. We find that MTA significantly outperforms existing protocols, e.g., improving deadline success ratio by 89% and reducing transmission cost by a factor of 9.7.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of identifying influential users in mobile social networks. Traditional approaches find these users through centralized algorithms on either friendship or social-contact graphs of all users. However, the computational complexity of these algorithms is known to be very high, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. We propose a lightweight and distributed protocol, iWander, to identify influential users through fixed-length random walks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to design a distributed protocol on smartphones that leverages random walks for identifying influential mobile users, although this technique has been used in other areas. The most attractive feature of iWander is its extremely low message overhead, which lends itself well to mobile applications. We evaluate the performance of iWander for two applications, targeted immunization of infectious diseases and target-set selection for information dissemination. Through extensive simulation studies using a real-world mobility trace, we demonstrate that targeted immunization using iWander achieves a comparable performance with a degree-based immunization policy that vaccinates users with large number of contacts first, while consuming only less than 1% of this policy's message overhead. We also show that target-set selection based on iWander outperforms the random and degree-based target-set selections for information dissemination in several scenarios.},

The uncoordinated, dense deployments of femtocells however, pose several unique challenges relating to interference and resource management in these networks. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose RADION, a distributed resource management framework that effectively manages interference across femtocells. RADION's core building blocks enable femtocells to opportunistically find the available resources in a completely distributed and efficient manner. Further, RADION's modular nature paves the way for different resource management solutions to be incorporated in the framework. We implement RADION on a real WiMAX femtocell testbed deployed in a typical indoor setting. We extensively evaluate two solutions integrated with RADION, both via prototype implementation and simulations and quantify their performance in terms of quick and efficient self-organization.},

 abstract = {RFID (radio frequency identification) technologies are poised to revolutionize retail, warehouse and supply chain management. One of their interesting applications is to automatically detect missing tags (and the associated objects) in a large storage space. In order to timely catch any missing event such as theft, the detection operation may have to be performed frequently. Because RFID systems typically work under low-rate channels, past research has focused on reducing execution time of a detection protocol, in order to prevent excessively-long protocol execution from interfering normal inventory operations. However, when active tags are used to provide a large spatial coverage, energy efficiency becomes critical in prolonging the lifetime of these battery-powered tags. Existing literature lacks thorough study on how to conserve energy in the process of missing-tag detection and how to jointly optimize energy efficiency and time efficiency. This paper makes two important contributions: First, we propose a novel protocol design that takes both energy efficiency and time efficiency into consideration. It achieves multi-fold reduction in both energy cost and execution time when comparing with the best existing work. In some cases, the reduction is more than an order of magnitude. Second, we reveal a fundamental energy-time tradeoff in missing-tag detection. Through our analytical framework, we are able to flexibly control the tradeoff through a couple of system parameters in order to achieve desirable performance.},

We first neglect propagation delay and study the ratio of transmission delay to distance, denoted by γ (λsAp and figure out its exact value in supercritical secondary network. In case of subcritical secondary network, we introduce a multi-cluster hop transmission process to get the lower bound of γ (λsAp.

Similarly, a consensus algorithm can also be used by the nodes to synchronize their clocks. Research on consensus algorithms has a long history, with contributions from different research communities, including distributed computing, control systems, and social science. In this talk, we will discuss two resilient consensus algorithms that can perform correctly despite the following two types of adversities: (i) In wireless networks, transmissions are subject to transmission errors, resulting in packet losses. We will discuss how average consensus can be achieved over such lossy links, without explicitly making the links reliable, for instance, via retransmissions. (ii) In a distributed setting, some of the nodes in the network may fail or may be compromised. We will discuss a consensus algorithm that can tolerate Byzantine failures in partially connected networks.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, an increasing number of objects can be represented by their wireless electronic identifiers. For example, people can be recognized by their phone numbers or their phones' WiFi' MAC addresses and products can be identified by their RFID numbers. Localizing objects with electronic identifiers is increasingly important as our lives become increasingly "digitalized". However, traditional wireless localization techniques cannot meet the fast growing needs of accurate and cost efficient localization. Some of these techniques require expensive hardware to achieve high accuracy, which is impractical for massive deployment. Others, such as WiFi RSSI based localization, are inaccurate and not robust to environmental noise. In this paper, we propose a new localization technique called EV-Loc. In EV-Loc, we use visual signals to help improve the accuracy of wireless localization. Our technique fully leverages visual signals' high accuracy and electronic signals' pervasiveness. To effectively couple these two signals, we design an E-V match engine to find the correspondence between an object's electronic identifier and its visual appearance. We implement our technique on mobile devices and evaluate it in real-world scenarios. The localization error is less than 1 m. We also evaluate our approach using large scale simulations. The results show that our approach is accurate and robust.},

@inproceedings{Singh:2012:CAS:2248371.2248404,
 abstract = {In today's OFDMA networks, the transmission power is typically fixed and the same for all the sub-carriers that compose a channel. The sub-carriers though, experience different degrees of fading and thus, the received power is different for different sub-carriers; while some frequencies experience deep fades, others are relatively unaffected. In this paper, we make a case of redistributing the power across the sub-carriers (subject to a fixed power budget constraint) to better cope with this frequency selectivity. Specifically, we design a joint power and rate adaptation scheme (called JPRA for short) wherein power redistribution is combined with sub-carrier level rate adaptation to yield significant throughput benefits. We further consider two variants of JPRA: (a) JPRA-CR where, the power is redistributed across sub-carriers so as to support a maximum common rate (CR) across sub-carriers and (b) JPRA-MT where, the goal is to redistribute power such that the transmission time of a packet is minimized. While the first variant decreases transceiver complexity and is simpler, the second is geared towards achieving the maximum throughput possible. We implement both variants of JPRA on our WARP radio testbed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme provides a 35% improvement in total network throughput in testbed experiments compared to FARA, a scheme where only sub-carrier level rate adaptation is used. We also perform simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of JPRA in larger scale networks.},

 abstract = {In this work, we investigate the use of epidemic routing in energy constrained Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). In DTNs, connected paths between source and destination rarely materialize due to the mobility and sparse density of nodes. Epidemic routing is well-suited for these environments due to its simplicity and fully distributed implementation. In epidemic routing, messages are relayed by intermediate nodes at contact opportunities, i.e., when pairs of nodes come within transmission range. Each node needs to decide whether to forward its message upon contact with a new node based on its residual energy level and the age of that message. We mathematically characterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and forwarding efficacy as a heterogeneous dynamic energy-dependent optimal control problem. We prove, somewhat surprisingly given the complex nature of the problem, that in the mean field regime, the optimal dynamic forwarding decisions follow simple threshold-based structures in which the forwarding threshold for each node depends on its current remaining energy. We analytically establish this result under generalized classes of utility functions for DTNs. We then characterize the dependence of these thresholds on current energy reserves in each node.},

In this paper, we discuss the first local distributed scheduling and power control algorithm in the SINR model that achieves an O(g(L)) approximation factor of the rate region, where O(g(L)) denotes the link diversity. As an intermediate step, we develop a scheduling algorithm in a k-hop interference model, which is used in the analysis of the more general model. Our algorithms are based on random-access and use local queue size information. Exchanging queue size information is challenging, and the complexity of this step is often ignored in prior local distributed algorithms. A novel aspect of our paper is the use of stale and infrequently updated queue size info, which significantly improves the complexity of our algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a framework of spatial spectrum access games on directed interference graphs, which can model quite general interference relationship with spatial reuse in wireless networks. We show that a pure strategy equilibrium exists for the two classes of games: (1) any spatial spectrum access games on directed acyclic graphs, and (2) any games satisfying the congestion property on directed trees and directed forests. Under mild technical conditions, the spatial spectrum access games with random backoff and Aloha channel contention mechanisms on undirected graphs also have a pure Nash equilibrium. We then propose a distributed learning algorithm, which only utilizes users' local observations to adaptively adjust the spectrum access strategies. We show that the distributed learning algorithm can converge to an approximate mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any spatial spectrum access games. Numerical results demonstrate that the distributed learning algorithm achieves up to 100% performance improvement over a random access algorithm.},

It is intended to support dynamic and diverse multicast requests typical of, for example, publish/subscribe and content-based communication. The scheme is built on top of a geographical routing layer. Each message is transmitted along the geometric minimum spanning tree that connects the source and all the destinations. Then, for each edge in this tree, the scheme routes a message through a random intermediate node, chosen independently of the set of multicast requests. The intermediate node is chosen in the vicinity of the corresponding edge such that congestion is reduced without stretching the routes by more than a constant factor. We first evaluate the scheme analytically, showing that it achieves a theoretically optimal level of congestion. We then evaluate the scheme in simulation, showing that its performance is also good in practice.},

 abstract = {We study adaptive network coding (NC) for scheduling real-time traffic over a single-hop wireless network. To meet the hard deadlines of real-time traffic, it is critical to strike a balance between maximizing the throughput and minimizing the risk that the entire block of coded packets may not be decodable by the deadline. Thus motivated, we explore adaptive NC, where the block size is adapted based on the remaining time to the deadline, by casting this sequential block size adaptation problem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. One interesting finding is that the optimal block size and its corresponding action space monotonically decrease as the deadline approaches, and the optimal block size is bounded by the "greedy" block size. These unique structures make it possible to narrow down the search space of dynamic programming, building on which we develop a monotonicity-based backward induction algorithm (MBIA) that can solve for the optimal block size in polynomial time. Since channel erasure probabilities would be time-varying in a mobile network, we further develop a joint real-time scheduling and channel learning scheme with adaptive NC that can adapt to channel dynamics. We also generalize the analysis to multiple flows with hard deadlines and long-term delivery ratio constraints, devise a low-complexity online scheduling algorithm integrated with the MBIA, and then establish its asymptotic throughput-optimality. In addition to analysis and simulation results, we perform high fidelity wireless emulation tests with real radio transmissions to demonstrate the feasibility of the MBIA in finding the optimal block size in real time.},

Example applications include tracking personnel underground or animals under dense tree canopies. We assume that each sensor uses inertial, visual or mechanical odometry to measure its relative movement as a series of displacement vectors. Each displacement vector suffers a small quantity of error which compounds, causing the overall accuracy of the positional estimate to decrease with time. The primary contribution of this paper is a novel offline method of counteracting this error by exploiting opportunistic radio encounters between sensors. We fuse encounter information with the displacement vectors to build a graph that models sensor mobility. We show that two dimensional sensor tracking is equivalent to finding an embedding of this graph in the plane. Finally, using radio, inertial and ground truth trace data, we conduct simulations to observe how the number of anchors, transmission range and radio noise affect the performance of the proposed model. We compare these results to those from a competing model in the literature.},

In this paper, we study the Minimum-Energy Connected Coverage (MeCoCo) problem in WSNs with Omni-directional (O) and Directional (D) features, aiming at minimizing the total energy cost of both sensing and connectivity. Considering different combinations of O and D features, we study the MeCoCo problem under four cases, namely: O-Antenna and O-Sensor (OAOS), O-Antenna and D-Sensor (OADS), D-Antenna and D-Sensor (DADS), as well as D-Antenna and O-Sensor (DAOS). We prove that the MeCoCo problem is NP-hard under all these cases, and present approximation algorithms with provable approximation ratios. In particular, we propose a constant-approximation for OAOS, and polylogarithmic approximations for all other cases.

 abstract = {Dynamic spectrum access is a maturing technology that allows next generation wireless devices to make highly efficient use of wireless spectrum. Spectrum can be allocated on an on-demand basis for a given geographic location, time duration and frequency range. However, a major obstacle to adoption remains. There are no effective solutions to protect licensed users from spectrum misuse, where users transmit without properly licensing spectrum, and in doing so, interfere and disrupt legitimate flows to whom the spectrum is assigned. Given the flexibility of today's cognitive radios, an application can easily transmit on frequencies outside of its allocated range, either accidentally due to misconfiguration, or intentionally to avoid spectrum licensing costs. In this paper, we propose a system to secure dynamic spectrum transmissions, where authorized users embed secure spectrum permits into data transmissions, thus enabling patrolling trusted devices to detect devices transmitting without authorization. We focus our attention on the development of spectrum permits, and describe Gelato, a spectrum misuse detection system that minimizes both hardware costs and performance overhead on legitimate data transmissions.},

 abstract = {We study the multicast capacity of a random wireless network consisting of n randomly placed ordinary wireless nodes and m regularly placed base stations in a square region, known as a hybrid network. All ordinary wireless nodes have the uniform transmission range r and uniform interference range R=θ(r) and they can transmit/receive at Wa-bps. Each base station can communicate with adjacent base stations directly with a data rate WB-bps and the data transmission rate between a base station and a wireless node is assumed to be Wc-bps. Assume that there is a random set of ns ordinary wireless nodes that will serve as the source nodes of ns multicast flows (each has randomly selected k-1 receivers). Each flow will have data rate λi bps. We found that the minimum per-flow multicast capacity min n s over i = 1 λi for hybrid networks has three regimes, and for each regime we derive matching asymptotic upper and lower bounds. Thus it closes the gap of previous results in the literature.},

 abstract = {Beamforming is a signal processing technique with numerous benefits. Unlike with omni-directional communications, it focuses the energy of the transmitted and/or the received signal in a particular direction. Although beamforming has been extensively studied on conventional systems such as WiFi, little is known about its practical impact on OFDMA femtocell deployments. Since OFDMA schedules multiple clients (users) in the same frame (in contrast to WiFi), designing intelligent scheduling mechanisms and at the same time leveraging beamforming, is a challenging task. Unlike downlink, we show that the integration of beamforming with uplink scheduling projects an interesting trade-off between beamforming gain on the one hand, and the power pooling gain resulting from joint multi-user scheduling on the other hand. This, in turn, makes the uplink scheduling problem even hard to approximate. To address this, we propose algorithms that are simple to implement, yet provably efficient with a worst case guarantee of half. We implement our solutions on a real WiMAX femtocell platform integrated with an eight-element phased array beamforming antenna. Evaluations from both prototype implementation and trace-driven simulations show that our solution delivers throughput gains of over 40% compared to an omni-directional scheme.},

 abstract = {Mobile devices are increasingly being relied on for services that go beyond simple connectivity and require more complex processing. Fortunately, a mobile device encounters, possibly intermittently, many entities capable of lending it computational resources. At one extreme is the traditional cloud-computing context where a mobile device is connected to remote cloud resources maintained by a service provider with which it has an established relationship. In this paper we consider the other extreme, where a mobile device's contacts are only with other mobile devices, where both the computation initiator and the remote computational resources are mobile, and where intermittent connectivity among these entities is the norm. We present the design and implementation of a system, Serendipity, that enables a mobile computation initiator to use remote computational resources available in other mobile systems in its environment to speedup computing and conserve energy. We propose a simple but powerful job structure that is suitable for such a system. Serendipity relies on the collaboration among mobile devices for task allocation and task progress monitoring functions. We develop algorithms that are designed to disseminate tasks among mobile devices by accounting for the specific properties of the available connectivity. We also undertake an extensive evaluation of our system, including experience with a prototype, that demonstrates Serendipity's performance.},

Eliminating the service discovery and connection (including potential pairing) phases in Bluetooth allows for speedier and more power-efficient conveying of location information using friendly device names. Furthermore, we observe that using the signal strength commonly provided in reference APIs of mobile OSs, client distances can be calculated with high accuracy and without additional power penalties.},
