 abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of mobile technologies designed to enrich our lives by increasing our productivity, keeping us abreast of news, tracking our fitness, and connecting us to people right across the world. Despite these advantages, excessive mobile phone usage -- especially during face-to-face social interactions -- has been reported to cause significant negative social impact. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for a study investigating the motivations and patterns of phone usage in social situations, and developing intervention mechanism to direct users' attention away from their phones and towards their physical social space. We have conducted a small user study as a proof of concept and, although we cannot draw any inferences about the general population at this early stage, our findings do provide some indication of key reasons behind the phone usage and different usage patterns across the study participants. The concept of proactively interrupting users to discourage mobile phone use during social situations has been favourably received by our participants, and warrants further development into a more sophisticated form before conducting a larger scale study.},

These notifications may raise awareness, but also have the downside of being disruptive. In this paper we present a laboratory study investigating users' attitudes towards notifications and how they deal with notification settings on their smartphones. Permission requests for sending push notifications on iOS don't inform the user about the nature of notifications of this app, leaving the user to make a rather uninformed choice on whether to accept or deny. We show that requests including explanations are significantly more likely to be accepted. Our results further indicate that apart from being disruptive, notifications may create stress due to information overload. Notification settings, once assigned a preset, are rarely changed, although not necessarily matching the favored one.},

Given that more and more services attempt to attract mobile phone users' attention via push notifications, attention in this context can be considered as an increasingly scarce resource. However, when people are bored, by definition, they seek stimuli and hence often turn to their mobile phones. We cite evidence from our most recent work that boredom can be inferred from patterns of mobile phone usage and that during inferred phases of boredom, people are more likely to engage with suggested content. Thus, using boredom as content-independent trigger might help to make proactive recommendations a more pleasant experience and, in consequence, more successful.},

Our approach to structure a PD workshop is to embed a pre-activity where children can have simulated experiences in a situated context. In a main-activity, children engaged in creating game scenarios with gamification strategies through the layered elaboration technique.

 abstract = {There is a growing realization that the notion of sustainability should encompass the aspect of human energy as well as environmental resources. Indeed, many HCI researchers have already concerned themselves with designing persuasive technologies leading towards human sustainability. Self-reflection plays at least two critical roles in these initiatives: (1) it is frequently used as a research method to understand behaviors and inform design; (2) technology-mediated reflection can be provided as a system feature that catalyzes learning and behavior change towards more effective management of human energetic resources. We argue that automatically-captured first-person-perspective images can add utility to both routes by augmenting participants/users' self-reflection process.},

With PCs, smartphones, smartwatches, smart glasses, and smart TVs the number of devices that display notifications currently increases. Users receive notifications on multiple devices at the same time which further aggravate the disruptive nature of notifications. In particular, displaying notifications is a main use case for smartwatches. While a body of work studied notifications on other devices, this paper investigates notifications on smartwatches. We conducted an online survey to assess users' expectations for notifications on different devices. We contrast the results with an in-situ study where we ask participants to rate individual notifications shown on a smartwatch. The results reveal that the importance of notifications depends not only on the type of app that creates them but also on the type of smart device that shows them. We conclude that a holistic notification service that manages the distribution of notifications is needed.},

Unfortunately, usability is always a secondary aspect when developing interfaces, because of the effort it requires in terms of money and time. Introducing gamification, i.e. engaging end-users in usability evaluation by means of a mobile game, could be a winning strategy to collect valuable usability data to be used by developers and usability experts in the design of more usable mobile applications. By means of a game application that proposes different types of interfaces to users, one can collect a big amount of data, which can become statistically meaningful to be considered in the design of such kind of interfaces. The motivation induced by the gaming and challenge logic provides a guarantee that users try to use the interfaces in the best way, in order to gain the best score and improve their reputation. This provides the basis for computing objective metrics leading to the best interface design among the ones proposed to users.},

As such, notifications are the main mechanisms to proactively communicate with the user. Focusing on individual device types such as PCs and smartphones, previous work showed that notifications can be distractive and disruptive. The ongoing wave of smart devices makes it possible to reach the user through multiple devices at once -- amplifying the effects of notifications. What is missing is an understanding of notifications in a multi-device environment to enable the smart management of notifications across devices. In this paper we present a system that is able to share notifications across smartphones, tablets, PCs, and smart TVs. It can further reach users through connected devices such as smart watches and smart glasses. The system currently distributes 5.3 million notifications by almost 30,000 users every day. It is not only intended to provide a holistic notification mechanism but also serves us to conduct large scale user studies to gain a deeper understanding of notifications in a multi-device environment.},

Despite the advantages of PRSs, especially in the mobile scenario where users could be provided with relevant items on-the-fly when needed, the area of PRSs is still unexplored with many challenges. In particular, it is crucial to identify the relevant items for the target users as well as to determine the right context for pushing these items, since otherwise the user acceptance, and therefore system success, will be negatively impacted. In this paper, we propose a new model that scores each item on two dimensions, preference fit and context fit, to proactively push relevant items to the target user in the right context. Furthermore, we present the preliminary design of a prototype of a mobile Point of Interest (POI) recommender which will be implemented in order to evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed model.},

It states that learning is most effective when building knowledge through active engagement. Experiential and discovery learning by challenges inspire creativity, and projects allow independent thinking and new ways of learning information. This paper describes how the "No One Left Behind" (NOLB) project plans to integrate this approach into school curricula using two concepts. The first one is to enable students to create their own games with Pocket Code by using its easy-to-learn visual programming language. The second concept is to foster collaboration and teamwork through hands-on sessions by conducting Game Jams using Pocket Code, so called Pocket Game Jams. We present insights into such a Pocket Game Jam and give an outlook on how we will use this concept.},

The current market provides several accessibility devices that can be coupled to mobile devices, extending their interface abilities. However, there is not a work that compares such devices and assists the job of developers in finding an adequate device in accordance with their needs. Considering this scenario, this paper analyzed 60 scientific articles and over 250 relevant sites to identify devices that facilitate the use of applications running on mobile operating systems for impaired people. At the final of the process, 15 products were analyzed and compared against predefined features. Apart the number of existing devices for accessibility, it is possible to conclude that the market is still requiring a higher variety of options and further researches to provide a better level of accessibility for impaired users.},

At the same time, older adults are using the Internet and mobile technologies in increasingly large numbers. As evidenced by the proceedings of many conferences such as the ACM MobileHCI or the ACM CHI, the usability of interactive technologies designed for older adults is of significant concern. Yet, the methodologies we employ for designing and evaluating such interfaces are largely the same as those used for any other user group. In this position paper, we argue that one methodological size does not fit all especially when it comes to usability evaluations with older adults. We do so by reflecting on our own experiences with designing and evaluating interactive technologies for older adults (particularly for those over 80 years -- the "oldest old"). We then propose for discussion senior-centred approaches and adaptations of established usability evaluation methodologies.},

Personal and intimate display devices such as head-mounted displays, smartwatches, smartphones and tablets are rarely part of such a multi-display ecosystem. This presents an opportunity to realise "body proximate" display environments, employing on and around the body displays. These can be formed by combining multiple handheld, head-mounted, wrist-worn or other personal or appropriated displays. However, such an ecosystem encapsulating evermore interaction points, is not yet well understood. For example, does this trap the user in an "interaction bubble" even more than interaction with individual displays such as smartphones? Within this paper, we investigate the perceptual and social challenges that could inhibit the adoption and acceptance of interactive proximate display ecosystems. We conclude with a series of research questions raised in the consideration of such environments.},

The purpose of this work is twofold: a) we will examine the potential of PulseCam to capture pictures of significant moments and b) investigate the potential of such pictures to improve one's ability to remember.

Experimental results showed that it is possible that encumbrance had no significant effect on pressure-based targeting performance.

 abstract = {We present the prototype design for a novel user interface, which extends the concept of tangible user interfaces from mostly specialized hardware components and studio deployment to commodity mobile devices in daily life. Our prototype enables mobile devices to be components of a tangible interface where each device can serve as both, a touch sensing display and as a tangible item for interaction. The only necessary modification is the attachment of a conductive 2D touch pattern on each device. Compared to existing approaches, our Active Commodity Tangible User Interfaces (ACTUI) can display graphical output directly on their built-in display paving the way to a plethora of innovative applications where the diverse combination of local and global active display area can significantly enhance the exibility and effectiveness of the interaction. We explore two exemplary application scenarios where we demonstrate the potential of ACTUI.},

Gluey can minimize device switching costs, opening new possibilities and scenarios for multi-device interaction.

In our first study, we assessed the ability of a local person (the guide) to identify the view orientation of the remote person by looking at the physical pose of the telepresence device. In the follow-up study, we explored visual feedback methods for communicating the relative viewpoints of the remote user and the guide via a head-mounted display. Our results show that actively observing the pose of the device is useful for viewpoint estimation. However, in the case of telepresence devices without physical directional affordances, a live video feed may yield comparable results. Lastly, more abstract visualizations lead to significantly longer recognition times, but may be necessary in more complex environments.},

Mobile life has changed the way we communicate. It has added a freedom of movement that provides ease of use and a seamless connection to the social world. The smart communication of the youth represents a modern and fashionable lifestyle. The everyday life of the younger generation is undergoing drastic change. Smart mobile devices have brought us great convenience and have met the demands that other tools have been unable to fulfil. In this study we conduct observations, questionnaires and focus group interviews to collect data, with the aim of understanding Hong Kong young people mobile lifestyle transformation brought about by smart communication. We set up a PSDS (people, society, device and service) model with the purpose to better understand the interactive relationship between people and smart mobile devices. The findings implicate inspiration and direction for better user experience design in smart communication.},

 abstract = {On behalf of the organising and program committees for MobileHCI'14 we welcome you to Toronto, Canada, for the 16th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services. This year is particularly exciting given Toronto hosted CHI here earlier this year and now we return for this conference, the premier forum for innovations in mobile, portable and personal devices and with the services to which they enable access. MobileHCI brings together people from diverse areas, which provides a multidisciplinary forum for academics, hardware and software developers, designers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and potential solutions for effective interaction with and through mobile devices, applications, and services. The research community maintains a strong interest and commitment to the field with 211 paper submissions (134 full and 77 short). In the other submission categories we received 41 poster submissions, 11 demonstrations and mobile experience submissions, 8 doctoral consortium submissions, 16 industrial case study submissions, and 10 workshop submissions. This represents a doubling of industrial case study papers and a 5% increase in full paper submissions on 2013. Our 26-member international program committee completed a peer review process involving a broad reach into the research community, with over 390 experts asked to provide reviews. Three external reviewers first reviewed each anonymous submission, and a meta-review was provided by a program committee member along with a further review by a second program committee member. The program committee met in person in Toronto, Canada, on Sunday, April 27th, to select the papers for the conference. This face-to-face committee meeting provided the opportunity to discuss the papers, expert reviews, and discussions and to reach a final consensus. In addition it allowed us to clarify papers to be shepherded, improvements to be made and to form the initial sessions for the conference. Submissions were finally accepted only after the authors provided a final revision addressing the committee's comments. After this review process, the program committee accepted 45 papers (35 full papers and 10 short papers). The topics in the paper program, which are clustered into their respective sessions, include social networks, input and interaction, devices and interaction design, context awareness, 3D, e-learning, gesture interaction, user centered design, gesture and text entry, recommender systems and CSCW. This year the program committee gave best paper awards to the authors of two papers, "An In-Situ Study of Mobile Phone Notifications" and "ProactiveTasks: the Short of Mobile Device Use Sessions" along with five further honorable mentions. These awards and honorable mentions represent a special recognition of excellence and come from the entire program committee that were guided by nominations from the external experts and committee. In addition to our 45 papers it is our great pleasure to introduce the rest of this year's program which includes, 5 workshops on mapping, self-reflection, socio-technical practices, older adults and mobile healthcare, 4 tutorials on tangible interaction, mobile health, wearable computing and speech, 20 posters, 9 demonstrations and mobile experiences, 8 doctoral consortium papers, 5 industrial case studies, 7 design competition and future innovations along with a panel on mobile health in Canada. Our dedicated demonstrations and poster reception will allow you to see many of these parts of the program in more detail. In addition we are pleased to have two keynotes this year: Collective Mobile Interaction in Urban Spaces by Amahl Hazelton, Producer, Urban Spaces 2.0, Moment Factory Spaces of Innovation in Complex UX Design, Mark Vanderbeeken, CEO, Experientia Amahl Hazelton works at the convergence of art, event entertainment, architecture, urban design and digital technology. With a Masters degree in Urban Planning from McGill University, he is interested in new kinds of urban place making defined as much by digital technology and experience as by physical form. Inspiring urban gatherings, the technology /city interfaces that he directs cross technical boundaries, integrating massive urban projections with smart handset based control systems. X-Agora by Moment Factory is a scalable, connected, real time media management and playback system that can integrate motion sensors, video screens, and projectors with smartphone sensors, multi-media tools and data sources. Mark Vanderbeeken will describe Spaces of Innovation in Complex UX Design. Leading practice in mobile user experience design presents complex opportunities and challenges not always fully revealed in academic exploration and research. Addressing users with cultural and behavioral differences; understanding economic imbalances and wide demographic ranges amongst individuals and networks; including ethical considerations such as right to privacy and confidentiality, authorship, and transparency; perception and cognition; larger sustainability concerns; and understanding often ignored biases within the client group - these many factors define the contemporary user experience design landscape. How can we create a space for innovation that takes these constraints and people's context and aspirations into account? Mark will illustrate these challenges with examples from Experientia's practice, particularly through a project they recently conducted with Intel.},

They have been delivering daily lunches from homes to offices for over a century and any kind of error in their delivery process is almost negligible. They have maintained their heritage working process since the inception of the service and therefore any kind of technology has not been incorporated in their work. They are currently facing numerous business sustainability challenges such as reaching out to new customers and also in maintaining their existing customer base. In 8--10 years, the number of customers a dabbawala serves a day has reduced from 50 to around 20 now. Through our research we have understood that they will lose their current customer base soon as similar food delivery businesses with faster and better services are emerging. To empower them we introduce Dabbawala --- a mobile application that enables partnership between dabbawalas and food services around the city and directly connects them to their combined customer base. This application enables the customers to order lunch from anywhere in the city. Customer registrations and any kind of money transactions are all handled through the application. The application is also used within the Dabbawala community to manage teams and responsibilities.},

Modalities such as a user's location, her physical activity, time of day, can be used in machine learning models to infer if a user is going to welcome an incoming notification or not. However, the success of context-aware interruptibility systems questions the existing theory of interruptibility, that is based on the internal state of the user, not her surroundings. In this work we examine the role of a user's internal context, defined by her engagement in the current task, on the sentiment towards an interrupting mobile notification.

We investigated the impact of three types of recommender systems on consumers' trusting beliefs and purchase intention by varying the level of social presence in recommender systems. Additionally, we accounted for the importance of context-sensitive services in m-commerce by examining, whether different usage contexts yield preferences for a certain level of social presence in a recommender system. Our findings suggest that different types of recommender systems vary in their impact on trusting beliefs. Furthermore, the usage of recommender systems is more likely to translate into purchase intentions in high-risk situations. In high-risk situations, low levels of social presence in recommender systems are important whereas in low-risk situations, high levels of social presence are preferred. Limitations and future implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

This shifting paradigm of device interaction combined with the increasing popularity of wearables presents an exciting opportunity for researchers to reflect on existing qualitative methodologies employed in observational studies of mobile collocated interactions, and how these can be adapted to the changing landscape of technological interaction. This position paper discusses some of these methodologies, and questions the suitability of these approaches with respect to the changing form that devices can take.},

 abstract = {Soft wearables include clothing and textile-based accessories that incorporate smart textiles and soft electronic interfaces to enable responsive and interactive experiences. When designed well, they leverage the cultural, sociological and material qualities of textiles, fashion and dress; diverse capabilities and meanings of the body; as well as the qualities and capabilities afforded by smart and programmable elements. Textiles behave in particular ways. They are part of culture. No matter a person's views on fashion or dress, they will have an intimate relationship with textiles, as they are one of the few products worn much of the time, close to the body. When designing wearables a designer must consider a range of requirements that do not typically demand focus when designing products that are not worn, including: a particular sensitivity for material details; an eye for fit and comfort on bodies with perhaps diverse and idiosyncratic movement capabilities; openness to a diversity of meanings that may be generated; and consideration of wearers' intimate relations with technology. In this paper we discuss the opportunities and challenges of designing and using soft wearables, applying notions of situatedness and personal meaning-making to understand and posit values in relation to outcomes. We present three design cases focusing respectively on body, material, and context; and reflect on how the different design approaches might impact use. Finally, we reflect on how embodied and collocated interactions might extend understanding of how to frame wearables research.},

 abstract = {Eco labeling is one of the most important measures to encourage sustainable consumer behavior. However problems are identified in the consumer's ability to perceive and understand eco labels. The concept of information individualization was suggested to engage consumers by tailoring eco information that appeals to their preferences. In this paper we describe the design of a prototype based on the conceptual framework of eco information individualization. Using enabling technologies such as smartphone with NFC function, the proposed device will embed personal visual data (i.e. landscape photo retrieved from the user's Facebook page) into an individualized eco label. It is believed that the photo would provoke the user into reflecting on their experience and increase their attention to eco labels. We suggest a framework that evaluates the effectiveness of the device, and discuss some related issues of qualitative and quantitative research approaches.},

 abstract = {This paper evaluates how the "index finger zone" on the back of a smartphone could compensate for the limitations of the "thumb space." We conducted two experiments to investigate how to reach to a distant point comfortably with one hand. First, we gave the participants four typical tasks while using mobile phones (tapping, texting, calling, and scrolling). In these situations, we measured the position of the index finger and the thumb with the natural hand posture. Consequently, the index finger was primarily positioned in the upper left side. Second, the main experiment was to determine how a touchable area could be extended using the index finger zone on the back side. 1) Randomly selected tiles were touched 84 times with a thumb and 42 times with an index finger. 2) Each tile's preference was evaluated with a 5-point Likert scale. As a result, we found that the "comfort zone" could be expanded by 15% by using index finger zone.},

In this position paper we describe the results of a pilot study exploring the experimental in-the-wild validation of these findings in the context of run exercises. Based on today's technological improvements in data collection (advanced mobile and wearable sensors) and data visualization to capture and replay running exercise experiences, we created an experimental prototype that takes pictures during one's run and, based on the music one was listening to at the time, plays back slide shows of the experience. In an initial pilot study with 10 runners, we equipped 5 runners (the experimental group) with our prototype for 10 days and afterwards interviewed them on how the system influenced their exercise behavior.},

 abstract = {There are two simultaneous transformative changes occuring in Education: the use of mobile and tablet devices for accessing educational content, and the rise of the MOOCs. Happening independently and in parallel are significant advances in interaction technologies through smartphones and tablets, and the rise in the use of social-media and social-network analytics in several domains. Given the extent of personal context that is available on the mobile device, how can the education experience be personalised, made social, and tailored to the cultural context of the learner? The goal of this proposal is twofold: (a) To understand the usage, and student behaviour in this new environment (MOOCS and mobile devices) and (b) To design experiments and implement them to make these new tools more effective by tailoring them to the individual student's personal, social and cultural settings and preferences.},

 abstract = {Searching for unknown urban events in the hope of making serendipitous discoveries has been the focus of multiple mobile tourist guide and recommender systems. This study investigates how transitory search can be used as an interaction mechanism for making such discoveries on a mobile phone. Our prototype, onMelbourne, returns a changing collection of urban events within physical and temporal proximity based on the setting and adjustment of search sliders by the user. Laboratory tests with 5 participants show that users understand transitory search for urban events and do make serendipitous discoveries. In addition we found that users fear missing out on events not shown by the system, and that the choice of labels on sliders impacts their understanding of a slider set halfway. The contribution of the paper is a better understanding of how transitory search can facilitate explorative behaviour when browsing for urban events on mobiles.},
