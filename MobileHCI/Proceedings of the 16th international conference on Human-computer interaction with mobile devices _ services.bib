 abstract = {On behalf of the organising and program committees for MobileHCI'14 we welcome you to Toronto, Canada, for the 16th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services. This year is particularly exciting given Toronto hosted CHI here earlier this year and now we return for this conference, the premier forum for innovations in mobile, portable and personal devices and with the services to which they enable access. MobileHCI brings together people from diverse areas, which provides a multidisciplinary forum for academics, hardware and software developers, designers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and potential solutions for effective interaction with and through mobile devices, applications, and services. The research community maintains a strong interest and commitment to the field with 211 paper submissions (134 full and 77 short). In the other submission categories we received 41 poster submissions, 11 demonstrations and mobile experience submissions, 8 doctoral consortium submissions, 16 industrial case study submissions, and 10 workshop submissions. This represents a doubling of industrial case study papers and a 5% increase in full paper submissions on 2013. Our 26-member international program committee completed a peer review process involving a broad reach into the research community, with over 390 experts asked to provide reviews. Three external reviewers first reviewed each anonymous submission, and a meta-review was provided by a program committee member along with a further review by a second program committee member. The program committee met in person in Toronto, Canada, on Sunday, April 27th, to select the papers for the conference. This face-to-face committee meeting provided the opportunity to discuss the papers, expert reviews, and discussions and to reach a final consensus. In addition it allowed us to clarify papers to be shepherded, improvements to be made and to form the initial sessions for the conference. Submissions were finally accepted only after the authors provided a final revision addressing the committee's comments. After this review process, the program committee accepted 45 papers (35 full papers and 10 short papers). The topics in the paper program, which are clustered into their respective sessions, include social networks, input and interaction, devices and interaction design, context awareness, 3D, e-learning, gesture interaction, user centered design, gesture and text entry, recommender systems and CSCW. This year the program committee gave best paper awards to the authors of two papers, "An In-Situ Study of Mobile Phone Notifications" and "ProactiveTasks: the Short of Mobile Device Use Sessions" along with five further honorable mentions. These awards and honorable mentions represent a special recognition of excellence and come from the entire program committee that were guided by nominations from the external experts and committee. In addition to our 45 papers it is our great pleasure to introduce the rest of this year's program which includes, 5 workshops on mapping, self-reflection, socio-technical practices, older adults and mobile healthcare, 4 tutorials on tangible interaction, mobile health, wearable computing and speech, 20 posters, 9 demonstrations and mobile experiences, 8 doctoral consortium papers, 5 industrial case studies, 7 design competition and future innovations along with a panel on mobile health in Canada. Our dedicated demonstrations and poster reception will allow you to see many of these parts of the program in more detail. In addition we are pleased to have two keynotes this year: Collective Mobile Interaction in Urban Spaces by Amahl Hazelton, Producer, Urban Spaces 2.0, Moment Factory Spaces of Innovation in Complex UX Design, Mark Vanderbeeken, CEO, Experientia Amahl Hazelton works at the convergence of art, event entertainment, architecture, urban design and digital technology. With a Masters degree in Urban Planning from McGill University, he is interested in new kinds of urban place making defined as much by digital technology and experience as by physical form. Inspiring urban gatherings, the technology /city interfaces that he directs cross technical boundaries, integrating massive urban projections with smart handset based control systems. X-Agora by Moment Factory is a scalable, connected, real time media management and playback system that can integrate motion sensors, video screens, and projectors with smartphone sensors, multi-media tools and data sources. Mark Vanderbeeken will describe Spaces of Innovation in Complex UX Design. Leading practice in mobile user experience design presents complex opportunities and challenges not always fully revealed in academic exploration and research. Addressing users with cultural and behavioral differences; understanding economic imbalances and wide demographic ranges amongst individuals and networks; including ethical considerations such as right to privacy and confidentiality, authorship, and transparency; perception and cognition; larger sustainability concerns; and understanding often ignored biases within the client group - these many factors define the contemporary user experience design landscape. How can we create a space for innovation that takes these constraints and people's context and aspirations into account? Mark will illustrate these challenges with examples from Experientia's practice, particularly through a project they recently conducted with Intel.},
