 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 19th ACM Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming -- PPoPP'14. PPoPP is a forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including foundational and theoretical aspects, techniques, tools, and practical experiences. Given the rise of parallel architectures into the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices), we made an effort to attract work that addresses new parallel workloads, techniques and tools that attempt to improve the productivity of parallel programming, and work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures. In 2014, PPoPP will again be co-located with the 20th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-2014) and 2014 International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO-2014). Our joint events will take place in sunny Orlando, Florida, providing both a mid-winter escape from colder climates and also an opportunity for children and family-friendly activities. Our call for papers was enthusiastically answered with 184 submissions from academia, industry and national research facilities from all geographies. The PPoPP'14 Program Committee and external reviewers diligently evaluated each of the papers carefully and, after a rebuttal period and an in-person meeting, selected 28 papers for formal presentation at the symposium. An additional 17 submissions were selected for presentation at the Poster Session. Two joint (with HPCA and CGO) keynotes, by Mark Hill (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Norm Rubin (NVIDIA), and a PPoPP keynote by Kunle Olukotun (Stanford University) complete our technical program.},
