 abstract = {This poster is aimed at solving the problem of maximizing the energy margin of a solar-powered sensor network at a fixed time horizon, to maximize the network performance during an event to monitor. Using a game theoretic approach, the optimal routing maximizing the energy margin of the network at a given time under solar power forcing can be computed in a decentralized way and solved exactly through dynamic programming with a low overall complexity. We also show that this decentralized algorithm is simple enough to be implemented on practical sensor nodes. Such an algorithm would be very useful whenever the energy margin of a solar-powered sensor network has to be maximized at a specific time.},

 abstract = {This poster describes the information funnel, a data collection protocol for social sensing that maximizes a measure of delivered information utility. We argue that information-centric networking (ICN), where data objects are named instead of hosts, is especially suited for utility-maximizing transport in resource-constrained environments, because data names can expose similarities between named objects that can be leveraged for minimizing redundancy, hence maximizing utility. We implement the funnel on the recently proposed named-data networking (NDN) stack, an instance of ICN. With proper name space design, a protocol prioritizes transmission of data items over bottlenecks to maximize information utility, with very weak assumptions on the utility function. This prioritization is achieved merely by comparing data names, without knowing application-level name semantics, which makes it generalizable across a wide range of applications. Evaluation results show the information funnel improves the utility of the collected data objects compared with state-of-the-art solutions.},

Their current main shortcoming is that they are affected by severe noise components at both stations. Our aim in this work is to quantify the noise level introduced by the target in order to derive practical limits of the ranging accuracy achievable using off-the-shelf devices. For this purpose, we develop a low-noise experimental platform which allows us to measure the echo-reply delay with very high accuracy. Our preliminary results with two popular chipsets from different manufacturers show that the median echo-reply delay at the target is never equal to the nominal SIFS value, and it deviates by approximately 10-20 ns over time, suggesting a practical ranging accuracy limit of 3 m.},

 abstract = {The future of air traffic control (ATC) will heavily depend on the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol as a crucial component. ADS-B marks a paradigm change in airspace monitoring as global ATC is switching from an independent, radar-based approach to dependent, satellite-supported surveillance. With ADS-B, aircraft broadcast their own position and other information in short periodic messages to other aircraft and control stations on the ground. As the protocol is becoming mandatory in most airspaces over the next years, it is important that its characteristics and challenges are thoroughly investigated. The large-scale ADS-B data required to do this has not been openly accessible until now, as specialized and expensive infrastructure was needed. We demonstrate OpenSky, a sensor network based on low-cost hardware connected over the Internet, which enables real-world experimental studies. OpenSky works with off-the-shelf sensors run by volunteers distributed over Central Europe. Currently comprising 11 sensors, the sensor network covers an area of 720,000km2 km. We capture more than 30% of Europe's commercial air traffic, offering access to billions of ADS-B messages.},

CSense addresses the needs of these systems by providing a new programming model that supports flexible application configuration, a high-level concurrency model, memory management, and compiler analyses and optimizations. Our compiler includes a novel flow analysis that optimizes the exchange of data across components from an application-wide perspective. A mobile sensing application benchmark indicates that flow analysis may reduce CPU utilization by as much as 45%. Static analysis is used to detect a range of programming errors including application composition errors, improper use of memory management, and data races. We identify that memory management and concurrency limit the scalability of stream processing systems. We incorporate memory pools, frame conversion optimizations, and custom synchronization primitives to develop a scalable run-time. CSense is evaluated on Galaxy Nexus phones running Android. Empirical results indicate that our run-time achieves 19 times higher steam processing rate compared to a realistic baseline implementation. We demonstrate the versatility of CSense by developing three mobile sensing applications.},

 abstract = {Ultra-fine particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 microns, namely Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), are capable of penetrating the lung cells and circulating the circulatory system, and compose a major health threat to people. Although the government is publishing the outdoor PM2.5 concentration on an hourly basis, the indoor PM 2.5 concentration, to which most people expose for most of their everyday life time, remains unsupervised. The high cost of the professional PM 2.5 measuring equipments, which utilize filtering and direct mass measuring methodology, prevents the indoor air quality to be monitored pervasively. We designed and implemented PiMi air box, a cost-effective portable sensor, which is able to estimate the PM 2.5 mass concentration with satisfactory accuracy. The PiMi air boxes adopt the low-cost optical particle counting technology and convert the particle counts into PM 2.5 mass concentration via empirical diameter-distribution and density of particulate matters. The errors introduced by the individuality of the low-cost particle counters are offset during a machine-learning-based calibration procedure for each single unit. The PiMi air box enjoys a stunning cost reduction by a factor of 1,000 comparing to professional equipments, and still maintains an satisfactory level of accuracy for everyday life air quality measurement. Together with embedded Bluetooth connectivity and SmartPhone APPs, PiMi air box is well-suited for massive crowd-sourced indoor air-quality monitoring research.},

@inproceedings{Buevich:2014:FRM:2602339.2602341,
 abstract = {In this paper, we present the architecture, design and experiences from a wirelessly managed microgrid deployment in rural Les Anglais, Haiti. The system consists of a three-tiered architecture with a cloud-based monitoring and control service, a local embedded gateway infrastructure and a mesh network of wireless smart meters deployed at 52 buildings. Each smart meter device has an 802.15.4 radio that enables remote monitoring and control of electrical service. The meters communicate over a scalable multi-hop TDMA network back to a central gateway that manages load within the system. The gateway also provides an 802.11 interface for an on-site operator and a cellular modem connection to a cloud-backend that manages and stores billing and usage data. The cloud backend allows occupants in each home to pre-pay for electricity at a particular peak power limit using a text messaging service. The system activates each meter within seconds and locally enforces power limits with provisioning for theft detection. We believe that this fine-grained micro-payment model can enable sustainable power in otherwise unfeasible areas. This paper provides a chronology of our deployment and installation strategy that involved GPS-based site mapping along with various network conditioning actions required as the network evolved. Finally, we summarize key lessons learned and hypothesis about additional hardware that could be used to ease the tracing of faults like short circuits and downed lines within microgrids.},

 abstract = {We collaborate with environmental scientists to study the hydrodynamics and water quality in an urban district, where the surface wind distribution is an essential input but undergoes high spatial and temporal variations due to the complex urban landform created by surrounding buildings. In this work, we study an optimal sensor placement scheme to measure the wind distribution over a large urban reservoir with a limited number of wind sensors. Unlike existing sensor placement solutions that assume Gaussian process of target phenomena, this study measures the wind which inherently exhibits strong non-Gaussian yearly distribution. By leveraging the local monsoon characteristics of wind, we segment a year into different monsoon seasons which follow a unique distribution respectively. We also use computational fluid dynamics to learn the spatial correlation of wind in the presence of surrounding buildings. The output of sensor placement is a set of the most informative locations to deploy the wind sensors, based on the readings of which we can accurately predict the wind over the entire reservoir surface in real time. 10 wind sensors are finally deployed around or on the water surface of an urban reservoir. The in-field measurement results of more than 3 months suggest that the proposed sensor placement and spatial prediction approach provides accurate wind measurement which outperforms the state-of-the-art Gaussian model based or interpolation based approaches.},

 abstract = {While high throughput is the key for a number of important applications of sensor networks, performance of the state-of-the-art approach is often poor in practice. This is because if even one of the channels used in its pipeline is bad, the pipeline stalls and throughput degrades significantly. In this paper, we propose a new protocol called P3 (Practical Packet Pipeline) that keeps its packet pipeline flowing despite the quality differences among channels. P3 exploits sender and receiver diversities through synchronous transmissions (constructive interference), involving concurrent transmissions from multiple senders to multiple receivers at every stage of its packet pipeline. To optimize throughput further, P3 uses node grouping to enable the source to transmit in every pipeline cycle, thus fully utilizing the transmission capacity of an underlying radio. Our evaluation results on a 139-node testbed show that P3 achieves an average goodput of 178.5 Kbps while goodput of the state-of-the-art high throughput protocol PIP (Packets In Pipeline) is only 31 Kbps. More interestingly, P3 achieves a minimum goodput of about 149 Kbps, while PIP's goodput reduces to zero in 65% of the cases.},

 abstract = {There is high interest in up-scaling capacities of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. However, variability and uncertainty in power output is a major concern and forecasting is, therefore, a top priority. Advancements in forecasting can potentially limit the impact of fluctuations in solar power generation, specifically in cloudy days when the variability and dynamics are the largest. We propose SIPS, Solar Irradiance Prediction System, a novel sensing infrastructure using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to enable sensing of solar irradiance for solar power generation forecasting. In this paper, we report the findings of a deployment of a hierarchical WSN system consisting of 19 TelosB nodes equipped with solar irradiance sensors, and 5 MicaZ nodes equipped with GPS boards, deployed in the vicinity of a 1 MW solar array. We evaluate different irradiance sensor types and the performance of different novel prediction methods using SIPS? data and show that the spatial-temporal cross-correlations between sensor node readings and solar array output power exists and can be exploited to improve prediction accuracy. Using this data for short-term solar forecasting for cloudy days with very high dynamics in solar output power generation - the worst case scenario for prediction - we get an average of 97.24% accuracy in our prediction for short time horizon forecasting and 240% reduction of predicted normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) compared to state-of-the-art methods that do not use SIPS data.},

 abstract = {We present eNav, a smartphone-based vehicular GPS navigation system that has an energy-saving location sensing mode capable of drastically reducing navigation energy needs. Traditional implementations sample the phone GPS at the highest possible rate (usually 1Hz) to ensure constant highest possible localization accuracy. This practice results in excessive phone battery consumption and reduces the attainable length of a navigation session. The seemingly most common solution would be to always use a car-charger and keep the phone plugged-in during navigation at all times. However, according to a comprehensive survey we conducted, only a small percent of people would actually always carry around their phones' car-chargers and cables, as doing so is inconvenient and defeats the true ''wireless'' nature of mobile phones. In addressing this problem, eNav exploits the phone's lower-energy on-board motion sensors for approximate location sensing when the vehicle is sufficiently far from the next navigation waypoint, using actual GPS sampling only when close. Our user study shows that, while remaining virtually transparent to users, eNav can reduce navigation energy consumption by over 80% without compromising navigation quality or user experience.},

As a cost effective solution for non-invasive breathing monitoring, utilizing the received signal strength measurements of inexpensive transceivers has been proposed. However, the applicability of the available solutions is limited since they rely on numerous sensors. In this work, considerable improvement is made, and a respiratory rate monitoring system based on a single commercial off-the-shelf transmitter-receiver pair is presented. Methods that enable estimation and enhance the accuracy are presented and their effects are evaluated. Moreover, it is empirically demonstrated that the performance of the system is comparable to the accuracy of a high-end device for 3-4 orders of magnitude less price; achieving mean absolute error of 0.12 breaths per minute in the most realistic scenario of the experiments.},

Current solutions are costly, invasive, and difficult to maintain. Sub-metering approaches rely on - and are hindered by - complex hardware. To address these problems, we demonstrate a sub-metering system that can estimate the power draw of individual loads by augmenting aggregate measurements with very simple sensors. These sensors wake up at a frequency proportional to the power draw of a neighboring load, and report these wakeups to a central server. We model the relationship between each sensor's wakeup frequency and the load's power draw as a monotonically increasing polynomial. We calibrate each sensor's function by constructing a linear least squares problem that allows us to discover the set of polynomial coefficients that minimize the difference between the estimated power draw and the power draw as derived from the aggregate measurements. After calibration, we can convert sensor wakeup frequencies to power draw in real time. This systems approach to sub-metering results in deployments that are easy to install and maintain, allowing users to gain a broad yet detailed view of their energy consumption and costs.},

Since ADS-B will become mandatory by 2020 for most airspaces, it is important that aspects such as capacity, applications, and security are investigated by an independent research community. However, large-scale real-world data was previously only accessible to a few closed industrial and governmental groups because it required specialized and expensive equipment. To enable researchers to conduct experimental studies based on real data, we developed OpenSky, a sensor network based on low-cost hardware connected over the Internet. OpenSky is based on off-the-shelf ADS-B sensors distributed to volunteers throughout Central Europe. It covers 720,000 sq km2, is able to capture more than 30% of the commercial air traffic in Europe, and enables researchers to analyze billions of ADS-B messages. In this paper, we report on the challenges we faced during the development and deployment of this participatory network and the insights we gained over the last two years of operations as a service to academic research groups. We go on to provide real-world insights about the possibilities and limitations of such low-cost sensor networks concerning air traffic surveillance and further applications such as multilateration.},

 abstract = {Counting and identifying neighboring active nodes are two fundamental operations in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we propose two mechanisms, Power based Counting (Poc) and Power based Identification (Poid), which achieve fast and accurate counting and identification by allowing neighbors to respond simultaneously to a poller. A key observation that motivates our design is that the power of a superposed signal increases with the number of component signals under the condition of constructive interference (CI). However, due to the phase offsets and various hardware limitations (e.g., ADC saturation), the increased superposed power exhibits dynamic and diminishing returns as the number of component signals increases. This uncertainty of phase offsets and diminishing returns property of the superposed power pose serious challenges to the design of both Poc and Poid. To overcome these challenges, we design delay compensation methods to reduce the phase offset of each component signal, and propose a novel probabilistic estimation technique in cooperation with CI. We implement Poc and Poid on a testbed of 1 USRP and 50 TelosB nodes, the experimental results show that the accuracy of Poc is above 97.9%, and the accuracy of Poid is above 96.5% for most cases. In addition to their high accuracy, our methods demonstrate significant advantages over the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of substantially lower energy consumption and estimation delay.},

 abstract = {The explosive growth in social network content suggests that the largest "sensor network" yet might be human. Extending the participatory sensing model, this paper explores the prospect of utilizing social networks as sensor networks, which gives rise to an interesting reliable sensing problem. In this problem, individuals are represented by sensors (data sources) who occasionally make observations about the physical world. These observations may be true or false, and hence are viewed as binary claims. The reliable sensing problem is to determine the correctness of reported observations. From a networked sensing standpoint, what makes this sensing problem formulation different is that, in the case of human participants, not only is the reliability of sources usually unknown but also the original data provenance may be uncertain. Individuals may report observations made by others as their own. The contribution of this paper lies in developing a model that considers the impact of such information sharing on the analytical foundations of reliable sensing, and embed it into a tool called Apollo that uses Twitter as a "sensor network" for observing events in the physical world. Evaluation, using Twitter-based case-studies, shows good correspondence between observations deemed correct by Apollo and ground truth.},

In an attempt to reduce the energy cost of this data offloading operation, we propose Sparse-GPS1: a new computing framework for GPS acquisition via sparse approximation. Within the framework, GPS signals can be efficiently compressed by random ensembles. The sparse acquisition information, pertaining to the visible satellites that are embedded within these limited measurements, can subsequently be recovered by our proposed representation dictionary. By extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the acquisition quality and energy gains of Sparse-GPS. We show that it is twice as energy efficient than offloading uncompressed data, and has 5-10 times lower energy costs than standalone GPS; with a median positioning accuracy of 40 m.},

This paper gives a rigorous analysis of CNA and shows that waves of awake-state nodes automatically solve pusuit/evasion-type problems without centralized coordination. As a corollary of this work, we unearth some interesting topological interpretations of features previously observed in cyclic cellular automata (CCA). By considering CCA over networks and completing to simplicial complexes, we induce dynamics on the higher-dimensional complex. In this setting, waves are seen to be generated by topological defects with a nontrivial degree (or winding number). The simplicial complex has the topological type of the underlying map of the workspace (a subset of the plane), and the resulting waves can be classified cohomologically. This allows one to 'program' pulses in the sensor network according to cohomology class. We give a realization theorem for such pulse waves.},

 abstract = {While device-free localization (DFL), i.e., target without carrying any devices, is attractive, the need for a significant degree of pre-deployment effort is a key challenge. In this paper, we proposed the NDP method, which do not assume knowledge of the placement layout, including the parameters of the transceivers. The key intuition is that all of the distorted wireless signals caused by the target, even the many from unknown transceivers, are constrained the presence of the target(s). Despite the absence of any explicit pre-deployment calibration, NDP yields a 80th percentile error of 1.8m which is much butter than the 6.2m, 5.8m and 5m yielded by the three state-of-the-art algorithms from prior work.},

 abstract = {Device-free localization (DFL) plays an important role in many applications, such as the intrusion detection. Most traditional DFL systems assume a fixed distribution of the received signal strength (RSS) changes even they are distorted by different types of targets. It inevitably causes the localization to fail if the targets for modeling and testing belong to different categories. We propose a transferring scheme for DFL, which employs a rigorously designed transferring function to transfer the distorted RSS changes across different categories of targets into a latent feature space, where the distributions of the distorted RSS changes from different categories of targets are unified. A benefit of this approach is that the same transferred localization models can be shared by different categories of targets, leading to a substantial reduction of the human efforts. The results of experiments illustrate the efficacy of our transferring scheme.},

 abstract = {Home monitoring systems currently gather information about peoples activities of daily living and information regarding emergencies, however they currently lack the ability to track speech. Practical speech analysis solutions are needed to help monitor ongoing conditions such as depression, as the amount of social interaction and vocal affect is important for assessing mood and well-being. Although there are existing solutions that classify the identity and the mood of a speaker, when the acoustic signals are captured in reverberant environments they perform poorly. In this paper, we present a practical reverberation compensation method called RESONATE, which uses simulated room impulse responses to adapt a training corpus for use in multiple real reverberant rooms. We demonstrate that the system creates robust classifiers that perform within 5 -- 10% of baseline accuracy of non-reverberant environments. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of this matched condition strategy using a public dataset, and also in controlled experiments with six rooms, and two long-term and uncontrolled real deployments. We offer a practical implementation that performs collection, feature extraction, and classification on-node, and training and simulation of training sets on a base station or cloud service.},

When a user accesses the PiMi air box for his personal air quality data on his smartphone, the data is relayed to the backend PiMi cloud server for analysis. Accumulating large amount of indoor air quality data under different circumstances, the PiMi cloud server is able to use statistical learning methodologies to detect point of interests (POIs) in the data series, and asks users to label their activities or events at the POIs. Together with the user-reported physicality information on the indoor environments, PiMiair.org is able to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of the environment physicality and human behaviors on the indoor air quality, and mine the knowledges on how to alleviate indoor air pollution. We believe that by sharing these knowledge among the community, healthier breathing environments could be nurtured for the well-being of the public.},

Using additional passive infrared sensors, we show that ground temperature and local sensor temperature measurements are sufficient to correct the rangefinder readings and improve the flood detection performance. Since floods occur very rarely, we use a supervised learning approach to estimate the correction to the ultrasonic rangefinder caused by temperature fluctuations. Preliminary data shows that water level can be estimated with an absolute error of less than 2 cm.},

 abstract = {Leak localization is a major issue faced by water utilities worldwide. Leaks are ideally detected and localized by a network-wide metering infrastructure. However, in many utilities, in-network metering is minimally present at just the inlets of sub-networks called District Metering Area (DMA). We consider the problem of leak localization using data from a single flow meter placed at the inlet of a DMA. We use standard time-series based modeling to detect if a current meter reading is a leak or not, and if so, to estimate the excess flow. Conventional approaches use an a-priori fully calibrated hydraulic model to map the excess flow back to a set of candidate leak locations. However, obtaining an accurate hydraulic model is expensive and hence, beyond the reach of many water utilities. We present an alternate approach that exploits the network structure and static properties in a novel way. Specifically, we extend the use of centrality metrics to infrastructure domains and use these metrics to map from the excess leak flow to the candidate leak location(s). We evaluate our approach on benchmark water utility network topologies as well as on real data obtained from an European water utility. On benchmark topologies, the localization obtained by our method is comparable to that obtained from a complete hydraulic model. On a real-world network, we were able to localize two out of the three leaks whose data we had access to. Of these two cases, we find that the actual leak location was in the candidate set identified by our approach; further, the approach pruned as much as 78% of the DMA locations, indicating a high degree of localization.},

 abstract = {A variety of health and behavioral states can potentially be inferred from physiological measurements that can now be collected in the natural free-living environment. The major challenge, however, is to develop computational models for automated detection of health events that can work reliably in the natural field environment. In this paper, we develop a physiologically-informed model to automatically detect drug (cocaine) use events in the free-living environment of participants from their electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The key to reliably detecting drug use events in the field is to incorporate the knowledge of autonomic nervous system (ANS) behavior in the model development so as to decompose the activation effect of cocaine from the natural recovery behavior of the parasympathetic nervous system (after an episode of physical activity). We collect 89 days of data from 9 active drug users in two residential lab environments and 922 days of data from 42 active drug users in the field environment, for a total of 11,283 hours. We develop a model that tracks the natural recovery by the parasympathetic nervous system and then estimates the dampening caused to the recovery by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system due to cocaine. We develop efficient methods to screen and clean the ECG time series data and extract candidate windows to assess for potential drug use. We then apply our model on the recovery segments from these windows. Our model achieves 100% true positive rate while keeping the false positive rate to 0.87/day over (9+ hours/day of) lab data and to 1.13/day over (11+ hours/day of) field data.},

 abstract = {Face recognition is an element of many smartphone apps, e.g. face unlocking, people tagging and games. Sparse Representation Classification (SRC) is a state-of-the-art face recognition algorithm, which has been shown to outperform many classical face recognition algorithms in OpenCV. The success of SRC is due to its use of l1, which makes SRC robust to noise and occlusions. Since l1 optmisation is computationally intensive, SRC uses random projection matrices to reduce the dimension of the l1 problem. However, random projection matrices do not give consistent classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method to optimise the projection matrix for l1-based classification1. Our evaluations, based on publicly available databases and real experiment, show that face recognition based on the optimised projection matrix can be 5-17% more accurate than its random counterpart and OpenCV algorithms. Furthermore, the optimised projection matrix does not have to be re-calculated even if new faces are added to the training set. We implement the SRC with optimised projection matrix on Android smartphones and find that the computation of residuals in SRC is a severe bottleneck, taking up 85-90% of the computation time. To address this problem, we propose a method to compute the residuals approximately, which is 50 times faster but without sacrificing recognition accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the feasibility of our new algorithm by the implementation and evaluation of a new face unlocking app and show its robustness to variation to poses, facial expressions, lighting changes and occlusions.},

 abstract = {The omnipresence of indoor lighting makes it an ideal vehicle for pervasive communication with mobile devices. In this paper, we present a communication scheme that enables interior ambient LED lighting systems to send data to mobile devices using either cameras or light sensors. By exploiting rolling shutter camera sensors that are common on tablets, laptops and smartphones, it is possible to detect high-frequency changes in light intensity reflected off of surfaces and in direct line-of-sight of the camera. We present a demodulation approach that allows smartphones to accurately detect frequencies as high as 8kHz with 0.2kHz channel separation. In order to avoid humanly perceivable flicker in the lighting, our system operates at frequencies above 2kHz and compensates for the non-ideal frequency response of standard LED drivers by adjusting the light's duty-cycle. By modulating the PWM signal commonly used to drive LED lighting systems, we are able to encode data that can be used as localization landmarks. We show through experiments how a binary frequency shift keying modulation scheme can be used to transmit data at 1.25 bytes per second (fast enough to send an ID code) from up to 29 unique light sources simultaneously in a single collision domain. We also show how tags can demodulate the same signals using a light sensor instead of a camera for low-power applications.},

This paper presents the design and implementation of SOAR - a vision-based surveillance robot system that integrates an off-the-shelf Android smartphone and a gliding robotic fish for debris monitoring. SOAR features real-time debris detection and coverage-based rotation scheduling algorithms. The image processing algorithms for debris detection are specifically designed to address the unique challenges in aquatic environments. The rotation scheduling algorithm provides effective coverage of sporadic debris arrivals despite camera's limited angular view. Moreover, SOAR is able to dynamically offload computation-intensive processing tasks to the cloud for battery power conservation. We have implemented a SOAR prototype and conducted extensive experimental evaluation. The results show that SOAR can accurately detect debris in the presence of various environment and system dynamics, and the rotation scheduling algorithm enables SOAR to capture debris arrivals with reduced energy consumption.},

 abstract = {Temperature has a strong impact on the operations of all electrical and electronic components. In wireless sensor nodes, temperature variations can lead to loss of synchronization, degradation of the link quality, or early battery depletion, and can therefore affect key network metrics such as throughput, delay, and lifetime. Considering that most outdoor deployments are exposed to strong temperature variations across time and space, a deep understanding of how temperature affects network protocols is fundamental to comprehend flaws in their design and to improve their performance. Existing testbed infrastructures, however, do not allow to systematically study the impact of temperature on wireless sensor networks. In this paper we present TempLab, an extension for wireless sensor network testbeds that allows to control the on-board temperature of sensor nodes and to study the effects of temperature variations on the network performance in a precise and repeatable fashion. TempLab can accurately reproduce traces recorded in outdoor environments with fine granularity, while minimizing the hardware costs and configuration overhead. We use TempLab to analyse the detrimental effects of temperature variations (i) on processing performance, (ii) on a tree routing protocol, and (iii) on CSMA-based MAC protocols, deriving insights that would have not been revealed using existing testbed installations.},

 abstract = {Welcome to the 13th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN 2014) in Berlin, Germany. IPSN is one of the flagship research conferences of the networked sensing and control community, and continues to serve as a major forum for cutting edge research results. In IPSN 2014, we made a few changes from the past years. First, we merged the Information Processing (IP) and the Sensor Platforms, Tools and Design Methods (SPOTS) tracks. Over the years, SPOTS track has fostered the research and dissemination of networked sensor platforms and design tools. It is a stable and integral part of the conference. We no longer need to call it out as a separate track. In IPSN 2014, although the authors may indicate whether their submissions are targeted for IP or SPOTS track, the reviews were assigned across tracks to the most appropriate reviewers. Among accepted papers, one third are labeled as SPOTS submissions by the authors, a similar ration of those in the submissions. Another change in IPSN 2014 was an experimental call for Challenge papers. The goal of these papers is to motivate the research community to think about new directions and future challenges. We received five challenge paper submissions, but none has passed the rigorous review process. This year, we received 111 submissions spanning across all areas of network sensors and information processing. These papers are from 5 continents, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. The reviews were handled in two phases. In the first phase, all papers received three reviews. All papers with at least one weak accept recommendation entered the second phase, where they received at least two more reviews. A physical TPC meeting was held in Houston, TX, USA, where 46 papers were discussed by the committee. In the end, 23 papers were accepted to appear in the final program. The acceptance rate is 20.7%. Then, each paper was shepherded by a TPC member to ensure that the final versions meet the highest publication quality. In the entire review process, we handled conflict of interests seriously. TPC members were blocked from reading the reviews and listening to discussions on papers that they have conflict with. Two papers co-authored by a TPC chair were handled out of the review system.},

 abstract = {Indoor tracking and navigation is a fundamental need for pervasive and context-aware smartphone applications. Although indoor maps are becoming increasingly available, there is no practical and reliable indoor map matching solution available at present. We present MapCraft, a novel, robust and responsive technique that is extremely computationally efficient (running in under 10 ms on an Android smartphone), does not require training in different sites, and tracks well even when presented with very noisy sensor data. Key to our approach is expressing the tracking problem as a conditional random field (CRF), a technique which has had great success in areas such as natural language processing, but has yet to be considered for indoor tracking. Unlike directed graphical models like Hidden Markov Models, CRFs capture arbitrary constraints that express how well observations support state transitions, given map constraints. Extensive experiments in multiple sites show how MapCraft outperforms state-of-the art approaches, demonstrating excellent tracking error and accurate reconstruction of tortuous trajectories with zero training effort. As proof of its robustness, we also demonstrate how it is able to accurately track the position of a user from accelerometer and magnetometer measurements only (i.e. gyro- and WiFi-free). We believe that such an energy-efficient approach will enable always-on background localisation, enabling a new era of location-aware applications to be developed.},

 abstract = {We address the problem of estimating the neighborhood cardinality of nodes in dynamic wireless networks. Different from previous studies, we consider networks with high densities (a hundred neighbors per node) and where all nodes estimate cardinality concurrently. Performing concurrent estimations on dense mobile networks is hard; we need estimators that are not only accurate, but also fast, asynchronous (due to mobility) and lightweight (due to concurrency and high density). To cope with these requirements, we propose Estreme, a neighborhood cardinality estimator with extremely low overhead that leverages the rendezvous time of low-power medium access control (MAC) protocols. We implemented Estreme on the Contiki OS and show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art. With Estreme, 100 nodes can concurrently estimate their neighborhood cardinality with an error of â10%. State-of-the-art solutions provide a similar accuracy, but on networks consisting of a few tens of nodes and where only a fraction of nodes estimate the cardinality concurrently.},

 abstract = {Bulk data transmission is an important traffic pattern of many sensor network applications. These applications deliver large amounts of sensed data to a sink node for further processing. Most of the existing bulk data transmission protocols use a single flow of communication. This is inefficient as the radio at the source node is transmitting and the sink node is receiving packets for only half of the duration of the burst. We show in this paper that reduced contention because of directional communication enables us to construct node disjoint paths from the source to the sink node using only one wireless channel. This allows us to forward subsequent packets in the burst on the disjoint paths which maximises the radio transmit and receive time at the source and the sink node respectively. We demonstrate that this doubles the sink throughput as compared to a single flow of communication.},

 abstract = {Abstract--Manufacturers announce on a regular basis the availability of novel tiny devices, most of them featuring network interfaces: the Internet of Things (IoT) is already here -- from the hardware perspective. On the software side however, embedded platforms available so far made it uneasy for developers to build apps that run across heterogeneous IoT hardware. Linux does not scale down to small, energy-constrained devices, while alternatives such as Contiki yield a steep learning curve and lengthy development life-cycles because they rule out standard programming and debugging tools. RIOT is a new open source software platform bridging this gap. RIOT allows just about any programmer to develop IoT application with zero learning curve. This is achieved by allowing standard C and C++ application programming with multi-threading, using well-known debugging tools (gdb, Valgrind, profilers etc.), while requiring only a minimum of 1.5 kB of RAM. RIOT also provides built-in energy efficiency and real-time capabilities. These characteristics make this platform attractive in several contexts, including teaching in the field of the Internet of Things, and experimental research in the domain of sensor networks and the IoT.},
