 abstract = {LoRa, an emerging wireless technology, is examined for long range communication performance in a large area. Although LoRa shows good performance for long-distance transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated and interfered with by buildings, trees and other signal sources. In urban areas, our observation shows that LoRa requires a dense deployment of LoRa gateways to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can transfer data back to remote servers. Mesh networking is a solution for increasing the communication range and packet delivery ratio without the need to install additional LoRa gateways. This study presents our design of a LoRa mesh-networking module for IoT applications (e.g.,collecting data from multiple, widely distributed sensors on a university campus). We deployed 19 LoRa mesh-networking devices distributed in an 800m by 600m area on campus to serve as a gateway and to collect data at one-minute intervals. The results show our LoRa mesh networking module achieved a 88.49% packet delivery ratio (PDR), while the LoRaWAN in star-network topology was only 58.7% under the same conditions.},

With the seamless connection to the physical world, IoT provides tremendous opportunities to a wide range of applications. However, potential risks exist when the IoT system collects sensor data and uploads it to the cloud. The leakage of private data can be severe with curious database administrator or malicious hackers who compromise the cloud. In this work, we propose Kryptein, a compressive-sensing-based encryption scheme for cloud-enabled IoT systems to secure the interaction between the IoT devices and the cloud. Kryptein supports random compressed encryption, statistical decryption, and accurate raw data decryption. According to our evaluation based on two real datasets, Kryptein provides strong protection to the data. It is 250 times faster than other state-of-the-art systems and incurs 120 times less energy consumption. The performance of Kryptein is also measured on off-the-shelf IoT devices, and the result shows Kryptein can run efficiently on IoT devices.},

 abstract = {Wearable technologies play a central role in human-centered Internet-of-Things applications. Wearables leverage machine learning algorithms to detect events of interest such as physical activities and medical complications. These algorithms, however, need to be retrained upon any changes in configuration of the system, such as addition/ removal of a sensor to/ from the network or displacement/ misplacement/ mis-orientation of the physical sensors on the body. We challenge this retraining model by stimulating the vision of autonomous learning with the goal of eliminating the labor-intensive, time-consuming, and highly expensive process of collecting labeled training data in dynamic environments. We propose an approach for autonomous retraining of the machine learning algorithms in real-time without need for any new labeled training data. We focus on a dynamic setting where new sensors are added to the system and worn on various body locations. We capture the inherent correlation between observations made by a static sensor view for which trained algorithms exist and the new dynamic sensor views for which an algorithm needs to be developed. By applying our real-time dynamic-view autonomous learning approach, we achieve an average accuracy of 81.1% in activity recognition using three experimental datasets. This amount of accuracy represents more than 13.8% improvement in the accuracy due to the automatic labeling of the sensor data in the newly added sensor. This performance is only 11.2% lower than the experimental upper bound where labeled training data are collected with the new sensor.},

 abstract = {We present a method for calibration-free, infrastructure-free localization in sensor networks. Our strategy is to estimate node positions and noise distributions of all links in the network simultaneously - a strategy that has not been attempted thus far. In particular, we account for biased, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) range measurements from ultra-wideband (UWB) devices that lead to multi-modal noise distributions, for which few solutions exist to date. Our approach circumvents cumbersome a-priori calibration, allows for rapid deployment in unknown environments, and facilitates adaptation to changing conditions. Our first contribution is a generalization of the classical multidimensional scaling algorithm to account for measurements that have multi-modal error distributions. Our second contribution is an online approach that iterates between node localization and noise parameter estimation. We validate our method in 3-dimensional networks, (i) through simulation to test the sensitivity of the algorithm on its design parameters, and (ii) through physical experimentation in a NLOS environment. Our setup uses UWB devices that provide time-of-flight measurements, which can lead to positively biased distance measurements in NLOS conditions. We show that our algorithm converges to accurate position estimates, even when initial position estimates are very uncertain, initial error models are unknown, and a significant proportion of the network links are in NLOS.},

However, state-of-art camera systems do not support this as they are often limited to one application per camera. We believe that we should break the one-to-one binding between the steerable camera and the application. By doing this we can quickly move the camera to a new view needed to support a different vision application. When done well, the scheduling algorithm can support a larger number of applications over an existing network of surveillance cameras. With this in mind we developed Panoptes, a technique that virtualizes a camera view and presents a different fixed view to different applications. A scheduler uses camera controls to move the camera appropriately providing the expected view for each application in a timely manner, minimizing the impact on application performance. Experiments with a live camera setup demonstrate that Panoptes can support multiple applications, capturing up to 80% more events of interest in a wide scene, compared to a fixed view camera.},

 abstract = {Identifying "who is around" is key in a plethora of smart scenarios. While many solutions exist, they often take a theoretical approach, reasoning about protocol behavior with an abstract model that makes simplifying assumptions about the environment. This approach creates a gap between protocol implementations and the models used during design and analysis. In this paper, we take a system approach to continuous neighbor discovery: starting with the concrete technology of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) we build a protocol, called BLEnd, tailored to its constraints. Moreover, we also consider the very real effects of packet collisions, to our knowledge a first in this domain. Our ultimate goal is to directly empower developers with the ability to determine the optimal protocol configuration for their applications; in this respect, the slotless operation of BLEnd offers richer alternatives than state-of-the-art protocols. Developers specify the minimum discovery probability, the target discovery latency, and the maximum expected node density; these are used by an optimizer tool to parameterize the BLEnd implementation towards maximum lifetime. This paper shows that BLEnd not only achieves the user-specified goals, but does so more efficiently than analogous configurations of competing protocols.},

 abstract = {Sensor data acquired from multiple sensors simultaneously is featuring increasingly in our evermore pervasive world. Buildings can be made smarter and more efficient, spaces more responsive to users. A fundamental building block towards smart spaces is the ability to understand who is present in a certain area. A ubiquitous way of detecting this is to exploit the unique vocal features as people interact with one another. As an example, consider audio features sampled during a meeting, yielding a noisy set of possible voiceprints. With a number of meetings and knowledge of participation (e.g. through a calendar or MAC address), can we learn to associate a specific identity with a particular voiceprint? Obviously enrolling users into a biometric database is time-consuming and not robust to vocal deviations over time. To address this problem, the standard approach is to perform a clustering step (e.g. of audio data) followed by a data association step, when identity-rich sensor data is available. In this paper we show that this approach is not robust to noise in either type of sensor stream; to tackle this issue we propose a novel algorithm that jointly optimises the clustering and association process yielding up to three times higher identification precision than approaches that execute these steps sequentially. We demonstrate the performance benefits of our approach in two case studies, one with acoustic and MAC datasets that we collected from meetings in a non-residential building, and another from an online dataset from recorded radio interviews.},

Conflicts can occur due to lexical features, (such as, negation, antonyms, or numerical mismatch) or can be conditioned upon time and/or physiological status. Detecting conflicts from textual health advice poses several challenges, including, large structural variation between text and hypothesis pairs, finding conceptual overlap between pairs of advice, and inference of the semantics of an advice (i.e., what to do, why, and how). In this demonstration, we present a semantic rule-based system to detect different types of conflicts in online textual health advice statements in a context-aware and interpretable manner.},

 abstract = {Low-power wireless technology, i.e., IEEE 802.15.4, consumes less energy and is suitable for battery-powered applications; fixed-interval data reporting is a common characteristic of these applications, e.g., a wireless sensor needs to report its temperature or air quality every minute. However, data-receiving failure occurs frequently because the output power of such wireless technology is low, typically 1 mW in 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4; also, crowd wireless traffic on ISM 2.4 GHz usually has serious radio interference. Meanwhile, data sent from a wireless transmitter but is not received by a receiver is not only wasted energy but also causes potential radio interference with other wireless devices. Based on the observation of radio interference, we proposed an adaptive-delay transmission mechanism for increasing the energy efficiency and the packet delivery ratio of the fixed-interval reporting application. The timing of data reporting is adaptively postponed if the recent transmissions fail. By integrating this method, the number of data packet been sent is reduced by up to 42.7% in a high-interference period; therefore, the power consumption of the wireless transmitter is reduced.},

 abstract = {Recent results show that slotless, purely-interval based neighbor discovery protocols, in which time is assumed to be continuous, achieve significantly lower worst-case discovery latencies than time-slotted protocols. In slotted protocols, the discovery of device A by B and vice-versa occurs within the same slot, and hence the latencies for one-way and two-way discovery are identical. However, in purely interval-based protocols, these latencies are independent from each other, leading to longer mean latencies for two-way discovery. In this paper, we propose a cooperative approach to reduce this two-way discovery latency. In particular, each side broadcasts information on the time-period until its next reception phase takes place. The remote device adjusts its beacon schedule accordingly once a first packet is received. Compared to non-cooperative slotless protocols, this technique can reduce the two-way discovery latency by up to 43 %. We propose a theory to model such protocols and show that with an optimized schedule, our proposed protocol achieves considerably shorter mean latencies than all known protocols, while still guaranteeing worst-case latencies that are similar to the best known solutions. For example, compared to Searchlight-Striped, our proposed protocol achieves by up to 89 % lower mean latencies and by up to 86 % lower worst-case latencies.},

 abstract = {Sensing bed vibrations caused by heartbeats has shown great potentials in detecting and monitoring a person's heartbeats during sleep, without requiring special mattress or sheets, or assuming certain sleeping position/posture. Earlier work has studied how to use this method to detect heartbeats when a single subject is on the bed, and in this study, we aim to separate the heartbeats when multiple subjects share the same bed and the vibration signals are mixed together. Our heartbeat separation algorithm is based upon signal unmixing via time-frequency masking [4], which was originally designed to extract individual voices from two audio mixtures. Though these two problems have similarity, separating heartbeat signals is much harder and poses new challenges, mainly because heartbeat signals have a much smaller frequency range than audio signals, fluctuate considerably from beat to beat, and propagate through a mattress that has much more complex propagation properties than the air. In this study, we address these challenges by carefully designing the signal processing algorithms, especially in phase correction, filtering, window size choice, etc. Through detailed experimentation, we show that our technique can accurately separate two heartbeats (the most common case) using two vibration sensors (geophones in our case) - with an average estimation error below 2 beats per minute.},

 abstract = {Low-cost mini-drones with advanced sensing and maneuverability enable a new class of intelligent visual sensing systems. This potential motivated several research efforts to employ drones as standalone surveillance systems or to assist legacy deployments. However, several fundamental challenges remain unsolved including: 1) Adequate coverage of sizable targets; 2) Target orientation that render coverage effective only from certain directions; 3) Occlusion by elements in the environment, including other targets. In this paper, we present Argus, a system that provides visual coverage of wide and oriented targets, using camera-mounted drones, taking into account the challenges stated above. Argus relies on a geometric model that captures both target shapes and coverage constraints. With drones being the scarcest resource in Argus, we study the problem of minimizing the number of drones required to cover a set of such targets and derive a best-possible approximation algorithm. Building upon that, we present a sampling heuristic that performs favorably, while running up to 100x faster compared to the approximation algorithm. We implement a complete prototype of Argus to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed coverage algorithms within a fully autonomous surveillance system. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithms via simulations to compare their performance at scale under various conditions.},

This paper studies the time accuracy of these natural timestamps obtained from powerline electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which is mainly excited by powerline voltage oscillations at the rate of the ENF. However, since the EMR signal is often weak and noisy, extracting the ENF is challenging, especially on resource-limited sensor platforms. We design an efficient EMR conditioning algorithm and evaluate the time accuracy of EMR natural timestamps on two representative classes of IoT platforms - a high-end single-board computer with a customized EMR antenna and a low-end mote with a normal conductor wire acting as EMR antenna. Extensive measurements at five sites in a city, which are away from each other for up to 24 km, show that the high-end and low-end nodes achieve median time errors of about 50 ms and 150 ms, respectively. To demonstrate the use of the EMR natural timestamps, we discuss two applications, namely time recovery and runtime clock verification.},

 abstract = {The process of two wireless devices meeting over-the-air for the first time is referred to as neighbor discovery. In mobile ad-hoc networks, battery powered devices duty-cycle their radios during neighbor discovery. As a result, they transmit and receive for very short durations of time and sleep at other times. Energy-efficient protocols, which guarantee short, bounded latencies while achieving low energy-consumptions are highly important for long battery lifetimes. In the past, neighbor discovery has been carried out mostly using slotted protocols, which subdivide time into multiple, equal length periods, called slots. An alternative are slotless protocols, which decouple beaconing from listening and can potentially achieve lower latency-duty-cycle-relations. As in slotted protocols, they also guarantee bounded latencies. However, understanding the mechanisms that ensure these deterministic bounds is more complex than for slotted protocols, since they rely on less intuitive concepts. In this demo, we propose a setup that visualizes the operation of two radios with slotless protocols in real-time, thereby providing insights that help in understanding slotless neighbor discovery. This demo is supposed to accompany the paper entitled "Griassdi: Mutually Assisted Slotless Neighbor Discovery Protocols", which appeared at IPSN 2017 as a regular paper.},

@inproceedings{Alanwar:2017:PRL:3055031.3055080,
 abstract = {Aided by advances in sensors and algorithms, systems for localizing and tracking target objects or events have become ubiquitous in recent years. Most of these systems operate on the principle of fusing measurements of distance and/or direction to the target made by a set of spatially distributed observers using sensors that measure signals such as RF, acoustic, or optical. The computation of the target's location is done using multilateration and multiangulation algorithms, typically running at an aggregation node that, in addition to the distance/direction measurements, also needs to know the observers' locations. This presents a privacy risk for an observer that does not trust the aggregation node or other observers and could in turn lead to lack of participation. For example, consider a crowd-sourced sensing system where citizens are required to report security threats, or a smart car, stranded with a malfunctioning GPS, sending out localization requests to neighboring cars - in both cases, observer (i.e., citizens and cars respectively) participation can be increased by keeping their location private. This paper presents PrOLoc, a localization system that combines partially homomorphic encryption with a new way of structuring the localization problem to enable efficient and accurate computation of a target's location without requiring observers to make public their locations or measurements. Moreover, and unlike previously proposed perturbation based techniques, PrOLoc is also resilient to malicious active false data injection attacks. We present two realizations of our approach, provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, and also compare the performance of each against traditional methods. Our experiments on real hardware demonstrate that PrOLoc yields location estimates that are accurate while being at least 500x faster than state-of-art secure function evaluation techniques.},

 abstract = {In this work, we study privacy preserving trajectory sensing and query when n mobile entities (e.g., mobile devices or vehicles) move in an environment of m checkpoints (e.g, WiFi or cellular towers). The checkpoints detect the appearances of mobile entities in the proximity, meanwhile, employ the MinHash signatures to record the set of mobile entities passing by. We build on the checkpoints a distributed data structure named the MinHash hierarchy, with which one can efficiently answer queries regarding popular paths and other traffic patterns. The MinHash hierarchy has a total of near linear storage, linear construction cost, and logarithmic update cost. The cost of a popular path query is logarithmic in the number of checkpoints. Further, the MinHash signature provides privacy protection using a model inspired by the differential privacy model. We evaluated our algorithm using a large mobility data set and compared with previous works to demonstrate its utilities and performances.},

 abstract = {Localization of sensor nodes is important for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) especially for underwater WSNs (UWSNs). Among the existing UWSN localization approaches, reverse localization scheme (RLS) is an event-driven method suitable for underwater surveillance. RLS adopts the strongest arrival or the first arrival as the direct path, which is however not accurate enough due to the severe multipath effect in underwater acoustic channels. We propose median RLS (MRLS) to select the median path and weighted RLS (WRLS) by assigning each path with a possibility to be the direct path for UWSNs. Numerical results have validated the proposed schemes and further suggested that WRLS outperforms MRLS and traditional approaches and is capable to diminish the multipath effect.},

Current receivers consume too much power for energy-constrained situations like continuous location tracking on small wearable devices. Mainly, this is due to the large amount of GPS signal that has to be decoded to compute the first position fix. While Coarse-Time Navigation (CTN) can reduce the necessary signal to a few milliseconds, it is not robust to noise. Collective Detection (CD) of satellites can mitigate noise to some degree, but the basic method is computationally expensive. We show how CD can be solved optimally and efficiently. Furthermore, we improve the accuracy of CD by exploiting the shape of the likelihood function. All our results are based on real-world signal observations and we achieve localization accuracies of less than 25 meters using a single millisecond of signal. When using 10 consecutive millisecond samples the accuracy improves to less than 10 meters.},

 abstract = {The exponential growth of mobile videos has enabled a variety of video crowdsourcing applications. However, existing crowdsourcing approaches require all video files to be uploaded, wasting a large amount of bandwidth since not all crowdsourced videos are useful. Moreover, it is difficult for applications to find desired videos based on user-generated annotations, which can be inaccurate or miss important information. To address these issues, we present VideoMec, a video crowdsourcing system that automatically generates video descriptions based on various geographical and geometrical information, called metadata, from multiple embedded sensors in off-the-shelf mobile devices. With VideoMec, only a small amount of metadata needs to be uploaded to the server, hence reducing the bandwidth and energy consumption of mobile devices. Based on the uploaded metadata, VideoMec supports comprehensive queries for applications to find and fetch desired videos. For time-sensitive applications, it may not be possible to upload all desired videos in time due to limited wireless bandwidth and large video files. Thus, we formalize two optimization problems and propose efficient algorithms to select the most important videos to upload under bandwidth and time constraints. We have implemented a prototype of VideoMec, evaluated its performance, and demonstrated its effectiveness based on real experiments.},

 abstract = {Mobile sensor networks are a great source of data. By collecting data with mobile sensor nodes from individuals in a user community, e.g. using their smartphones, we can learn global information such as traffic congestion patterns in the city, location of key community facilities, and locations of gathering places. Can we publish and run queries on mobile sensor network databases without disclosing information about individual nodes? Differential privacy is a strong notion of privacy which guarantees that very little will be learned about individual records in the database, no matter what the attackers already know or wish to learn. Still, there is no practical system applying differential privacy algorithms for clustering points on real databases. This paper describes the construction of small coresets for computing k-means clustering of a set of points while preserving differential privacy. As a result, we give the first k-means clustering algorithm that is both differentially private, and has an approximation error that depends sub-linearly on the data's dimension d. Previous results introduced errors that are exponential in d. We implemented this algorithm and used it to create differentially private location data from GPS tracks. Specifically our algorithm allows clustering GPS databases generated from mobile nodes, while letting the user control the introduced noise due to privacy. We provide experimental results for the system and algorithms, and compare them to existing techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical system that enables differentially private clustering on real data.},

 abstract = {Cane-toads (Bufo marinus) are introduced to Australia to negate the insect pests. However, cane-toad population is out of control, and has highly affected native frog species for its great reproductive capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor cane-toads and control their population. Recent advances in acoustic sensors make it possible to monitor cane-toads over long periods. In this paper, we present a novel approach to analyze cane-toad calls for long-term monitoring. Specifically, recorded acoustic data is first transformed into spectrogram using short-time Fourier transform. Then, cane-toad calls are recognized with an oscillation detector. Next, recognized cane-toad calls are annotated for further analysis. Initial analysis of our method demonstrates promising results, with 71.36% true positive rate. With the oscillation detector, cane-toad calling activity is investigated over the whole year.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in the 3D through-wall imaging of a completely unknown area, using WiFi RSSI and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that move outside of the area of interest to collect WiFi measurements. It is challenging to estimate a volume represented by an extremely high number of voxels with a small number of measurements. Yet many applications are time-critical and/or limited on resources, precluding extensive measurement collection. In this paper, we then propose an approach based on Markov random field modeling, loopy belief propagation, and sparse signal processing for 3D imaging based on wireless power measurements. Furthermore, we show how to design efficient aerial routes that are informative for 3D imaging. Finally, we design and implement a complete experimental testbed and show high-quality 3D robotic through-wall imaging of unknown areas with less than 4% of measurements.},

 abstract = {Crowdsensing systems collect large-scale sensor data from mobile devices to provide a wide-area view of phenomena including traffic, noise and air pollution. Because such data often exhibits sparse structure, it is natural to apply compressive sensing (CS) for data sampling and recovery. However in practice, crowd participants are often distributed highly unevenly across the sensing area, and thus the numbers of observations collected over different areas may vary wildly - an issue we call density disparity. Density disparity leads to inaccuracy in low density areas, and potentially undermines the recovery performance if conventional compressive sensing is applied directly, which equally treats data from areas of different density. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic accuracy estimator, based on which we devise two recovery algorithms: Threshold Recovery (TR) and Weighted Recovery (WR). As general-purpose recovery algorithms, TR and WR improve the performance of CS in the scenarios with density disparity, and also provide better guarantees in terms of &ell;2-norm accuracy compared with conventional CS recovery algorithms. We also conduct extensive experiments based on synthetic and real-life datasets. Our results show that TR/WR typically reduce &ell;2-norm error by more than 60% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

 abstract = {Touch surfaces are intuitive interfaces for computing devices. Most of the traditional touch interfaces (vision, IR, capacitive, etc.) have mounting requirements, resulting in specialized touch surfaces limited by their size, cost, and mobility. More recent work has shown that vibration-based touch sensing techniques can localize taps/knocks, which provides a low-cost flexible alternative. These surfaces are envisioned as intuitive inputs for applications such as interactive meeting tables, smart kitchen appliance control, etc. However, due to dispersive and reflective properties of various vibrating mediums, it is difficult to localize taps accurately on ubiquitous surfaces. Furthermore, no work has been done on tracking continuous swipe interactions through vibration sensing. In this paper, we present SurfaceVibe, a vibration-based interaction tracking system for multiple surface types. The system accounts for physics properties of different waves to allow two major interaction types: tap and swipe. For tap induced impulse-like surface waves, we design an algorithm that takes wave dispersion and reflection into account to achieve accurate localization on ubiquitous surfaces. For swipe induced body waves, SurfaceVibe segments signals into 'slip pulses' to localize, and then tracks the trajectory. We validate SurfaceVibe through experiments on different materials and varying surface/sensing area sizes in this paper. Our methods achieve up to 6X decrease in localization error for taps and 3X reduction in length estimation error for swipes compared to existing algorithms that do not take wave properties into account.},

Few of the existing systems are accurate, unobtrusive, robust and easy to install at the same time. Thus, we propose a completely unobtrusive system which can detect heartbeats during sleep by sensing the weak ballistic vibrations caused by heartbeats on any bed. The system, HB-Phone, is centered around the off-the-shelf geophone sensor and can be easily installed on an existing bed. In this demo, we demonstrate that our system can detect and extract heartbeats accurately and in real time, even with the presence of noise from the environment and gross body movements during sleep.},

 abstract = {Despite the advent of numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, recent research demonstrates potential side-channel vulnerabilities exploiting sensors which are used for event and environment monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new side-channel attack, where a network of distributed non-acoustic sensors can be exploited by an attacker to launch an eavesdropping attack by reconstructing intelligible speech signals. Specifically, we present PitchIn to demonstrate the feasibility of speech reconstruction from non-acoustic sensor data collected offline across networked devices. Unlike speech reconstruction which requires a high sampling frequency (e.g., > 5 KHz), typical applications using non-acoustic sensors do not rely on richly sampled data, presenting a challenge to the speech reconstruction attack. Hence, PitchIn leverages a distributed form of Time Interleaved Analog-Digital-Conversion (TIADC) to approximate a high sampling frequency, while maintaining low per-node sampling frequency. We demonstrate how distributed TI-ADC can be used to achieve intelligibility by processing an interleaved signal composed of different sensors across networked devices. We implement PitchIn and evaluate reconstructed speech signal intelligibility via user studies. PitchIn has word recognition accuracy as high as 79%. Though some additional work is required to improve accuracy, our results suggest that eavesdropping using a fusion of non-acoustic sensors is a real and practical threat.},

The control center can collect information such as the visitors' viewing p, location, and status of activity level, enabling it to wirelessly send suggestions of exhibits and visiting paths to visitors, avoiding the overcrowding of visitors in one location. Meanwhile, visitors can communicate with the control center to update their locations and ask simple questions via the badge. In this paper, we introduce the system architecture and the prototype smart badge that we used to evaluate the performance of this system.},
