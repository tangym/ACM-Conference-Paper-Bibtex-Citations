 abstract = {Road lighting management, i.e., finding a faulty street lamp or street lamps blocked by overgrown trees for example, can improve road illumination and reduce traffic accidents. Based on previous work [1], which explores the use of illumination maps to detect faulty lamps, we present a road lighting management system for detecting significant changes in road lighting automatically. This system is characterized by eliminating any need to modify conventional street lamps. Therefore, the cost is extremely low compared to other approaches, e.g., Wireless sensor network for street lamp monitoring. We design a special embedded system, the Hitchhiker, for installation on fixed-route vehicles, such as shuttle buses, to collect illumination readings along the vehicle's route. All data from the Hitchhiker is uploaded to the Google App Engine (GAE) server for data storage, analysis, and user query; this allows identification of possible locations of faulty street lamps on the web-based management interface. We designed and implemented a prototype of the Hitchhiker and GAE server to demonstrate the practicability of this system; we are working toward enabling this design for automatic faulty street lamp detection in the near future.},

It has been shown that such systems can locate people who do not participate in the system by wearing any radio device, even through walls, because of the changes that moving people cause to the static wireless sensor network. However, many such systems cannot locate stationary people. We present and evaluate a system which can locate stationary or moving people, without calibration, by using kernel distance to quantify the difference between two histograms of signal strength measurements. From five experiments, we show that our kernel distance-based radio tomographic localization system performs better than the state-of-the-art NRES systems in different non line-of-sight environments.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Nemo -- a practical in situ power metering system for wireless sensor networks. Nemo features a new circuit design called shunt resistor switch that can dynamically adjust the resistance of shunt resistors based on the current load. This allows Nemo to achieve a wide dynamic current range and high measurement accuracy. Nemo transmits real-time power measurements to the host node solely through the power line, by modulating the current load and the supply voltage. This feature leads to a noninvasive, plug & play design that allows Nemo to be easily installed on existing mote platforms without physical wiring or soldering. We have implemented a prototype of Nemo and conducted extensive experimental evaluation. Our results show that Nemo can transmit high-throughput measurement data to the host through voltage/current load modulation. Moreover, it has satisfactory measurement fidelity over a wide range of operating conditions. In particular, Nemo yields a dynamic measurement range of 250,000:1, which is 2.5X and 7X that of two state-of-the-art sensor network power meter systems, while only incurring an average measurement error of 1.34%. We also use a case study to demonstrate that Nemo is able to track the highly dynamic sleep current consumption of TelosB motes, which has important implications for the design of low duty-cycle sensor networks that operate in dynamic environments.},

 abstract = {A user's location information is commonly used in diverse mobile services, yet providing the actual name or semantic meaning of a place is challenging. Previous works required manual user interventions for place naming, such as searching by additional keywords and/or selecting place in a list. We believe that applying mobile sensing techniques to this problem can greatly reduce user intervention. In this paper, we present an autonomous place naming system using opportunistic crowdsensing and knowledge from crowdsourcing. Our goal is to provide a place name from a person's perspective: that is, functional name (e.g., food place, shopping place), business name (e.g., Starbucks, Apple Store), or personal name (e.g., my home, my workplace). The main idea is to bridge the gap between crowdsensing data from smartphone users and location information in social network services. The proposed system automatically extracts a wide range of semantic features about the places from both crowdsensing data and social networks to model a place name. We then infer the place name by linking the crowdsensing data with knowledge in social networks. Extensive evaluations with real deployments show that the proposed system outperforms the related approaches and greatly reduces user intervention for place naming.},

 abstract = {Poor posture and incorrect muscle usage are a leading cause of many injuries in sports and fitness. For this reason, non- invasive, fine-grained sensing and monitoring of human motion and muscles is important for mitigating injury and improving fitness efficacy. Current sensing systems either de- pend on invasive techniques or unscalable approaches whose accuracy is highly dependent on body sensor placement. As a result these systems are not suitable for use in active sports or fitness training where sensing needs to be scalable, accurate and un-inhibitive to the activity being performed. We present MARS, a system that detects both body motion and individual muscle group activity during physical human activity by only using unobtrusive, non-invasive in- ertial sensors. MARS not only accurately senses and recreates human motion down to the muscles, but also allows for fast personalized system setup by determining the individual identities of the instrumented muscles, obtained with minimal system training. In a real world human study con- ducted to evaluate MARS, the system achieves greater than 95% accuracy in identifying muscle groups.},

To ensure visual sensing coverage, it is crucial to place optical sensor nodes at proper locations. Under the scenario of energy constrained wireless camera deployment, the issue of communication cost should also be considered. Previous camera deployment research (e.g Art Gallery Problem) mainly concerned sensing coverage. One well-known solution for the art gallery problem is to triangulate the objective polygon and then select vertices to ensure full coverage. However, deploying cameras only in the vertices of polygon may induce inefficiency both in number of necessary cameras and overall communication cost. To reduce the cost, we propose two deployment algorithms: 1) connected visibility region planning algorithm for static deployment given the floor plan is known, and 2) connected visibility region tracking algorithm for the dynamic deployment during the run time. In extensive simulations with real floor plans, our algorithms outperform previous solutions significantly.},

The homes have differing construction and a range of heating infrastructure (wall-mounted radiators, underfloor heating, and furnace-driven forced-air). Data was gathered using a network of simple and sparse (one per room) temperature sensors, a gas meter sensor, and an outdoor temperature sensor. We show that our model can predict future indoor temperature trends with a 90th percentile aggregate error between 0.61--1.50°, when given boiler or furnace actuation times and outdoor temperature forecasts. Two existing models were also implemented and then evaluated on our dataset alongside Matchstick. As a proof of concept, we used data from a previous control study to show that when Matchstick is used to predict temperatures (rather than assuming a preset linear heating rate) the possible gas savings increase by up to 3%.},

Accurate localization and tracking of multiple people in real-time is required in several real-world applications, such as ambient-assisted living, tactical operations, and pedestrian traffic analysis in stores. In these scenarios, RT systems must perform reliably also a) when the number of targets is not known a priori and varies over time, and b) when people interact, i.e., have intersecting trajectories, in the monitored area. We demonstrate a RT system which tackles all of these challenges and provides accurate tracking of a varying and unknown number of people (both stationary and mobile) in real-time.},

With the increased push for operational efficiency, operators are relying more on historical data processing to uncover opportunities for energy-savings. However, they are overwhelmed with the deluge of data and seek more efficient ways to identify potential problems. In this paper, we present a new approach called the Strip, Bind and Search (SBS); a method for uncovering abnormal equipment behavior and in-concert usage patterns. SBS uncovers relationships between devices and constructs a model for their usage pattern relative to other devices. It then flags deviations from the model. We run SBS on a set of building sensor traces; each containing hundred sensors reporting data flows over 18 weeks from two separate buildings with fundamentally different infrastructures. We demonstrate that, in many cases, SBS uncovers misbehavior corresponding to inefficient device usage that leads to energy waste. The average waste uncovered is as high as 2500~kWh per device.},

 abstract = {Despite recent advances in 3-D motion capture, the problem of simultaneously tracking human posture and position in an unconstrained environment remains open. Optical systems provide both types of information, but are confined to a restricted area of capture. Inertial sensing alleviates this restriction, but at the expense of capturing only relative (postural) and not absolute (positional) information. In this paper, we propose an algorithm combining the relative merits of these systems to track both position and posture in challenging environments. Offline, we combine an optical (Kinect) and an inertial sensing (Orient-4) platform to learn a mapping from posture variations to translations, which we encode as a translation manifold. Online, the optical source is removed, and the learned mapping is used to infer positions using the postures computed by the inertial sensors. We first evaluate our approach in simulation, on motion sequences with ground-truth positions for error estimation. Then, the method is deployed on physical sensing platforms to track human subjects. The proposed algorithm is shown to yield a lower average cumulative error than comparable position tracking methods, such as double integration of accelerometer data, on both simulated and real sensory data, and in a variety of motions and capture settings.},

@inproceedings{Loukas:2013:TGA:2461381.2461414,
 abstract = {In large-scale resource-constrained systems, such as wireless sensor networks, global objectives should be ideally achieved through inexpensive local interactions. A technique satisfying these requirements is information potentials, in which distributed functions disseminate information about the process monitored by the network. Information potentials are usually computed through local aggregation or gossiping. These methods however, do not consider the topological properties of the network, such as node density, which could be exploited to enhance the performance of the system. This paper proposes a novel aggregation method with which a potential becomes sensitive to the network topology. Our method introduces the notion of affinity spaces, which allow us to uncover the deep connections between the aggregation scope (the radius of the extended neighborhood whose information is aggregated) and the network's Laplacian (which captures the topology of the connectivity graph). Our study provides two additional contributions: (i) It characterizes the convergence of information potentials for static and dynamic networks. Our analysis captures the impact of key parameters, such as node density, time-varying information, as well as of the addition (or removal) of links and nodes. (ii) It shows that information potentials are decomposed into wave-like eigenfunctions that depend on the aggregation scope. This result has important implications, for example it prevents greedy routing techniques from getting stuck by eliminating local-maxima. Simulations and experimental evaluation show that our main findings hold under realistic conditions, with unstable links and message loss.},

 abstract = {Testbeds are indispensable for debugging and evaluating wireless embedded systems. While existing testbeds provide ample opportunities for realistic, large-scale experiments, they are limited in their ability to closely observe and control the distributed operation of resource-constrained nodes - access to the nodes is restricted to the serial port. This paper presents FlockLab, a testbed that overcomes this limitation by allowing multiple services to run simultaneously and synchronously against all nodes under test in addition to the traditional serial port service: tracing of GPIO pins to record logical events occurring on a node, actuation of GPIO pins to trigger actions on a node, and high-resolution power profiling. FlockLab's accurate timing information in the low microsecond range enables logical events to be correlated with power samples, thus providing a previously unattained level of visibility into the distributed behavior of wireless embedded systems. In this paper, we describe FlockLab's design, benchmark its performance, and demonstrate its capabilities through several real-world test cases.},

Data from these sensors are then relayed back to the main meter using a low-latency wireless sensor networking protocol, where changes in the total power consumption of the house are used to determine the power usage of individual appliances. The sensors are low-cost, easy to deploy and are able to detect current changes associated with the appliance from a few inches away making it possible to externally monitor in-wall wiring to devices like overhead lights or heavy machinery that might operate on multiple phases of the AC distribution system of the building. Appliance-level energy data provide continuous feedback to end users about their consumption patterns and provide building managers accurate information that can be used to target the most effective update and retrofit strategies.},

The low power consumption of analog signal processing (ASP) is well-suited for this task. However, the quick adoption of this technology has been restrained by the fact that ASP implementation requires a priori knowledge of the application space. Our solution to this challenge is to enable run-time reconfiguration through the use of a field-programmable analog array (FPAA). In the same way that reconfigurable digital systems allow system designers to change the infrastructure of digital blocks, an FPAA allows an application developer to change the infrastructure of, and even tune, ASP blocks without circuit-level expertise. We will demonstrate that an FPAA can be used to (1) facilitate the use of ASP to reduce power consumption, and to (2) allow run-time reconfigurability to maximize ASP impact.},

 abstract = {Low Power Listening (LPL) is a common MAC-layer technique for reducing energy consumption in wireless sensor networks, where nodes periodically wakeup to sample the wireless channel to detect activity. However, LPL is highly susceptible to false wakeups caused by environmental noise being detected as activity on the channel, causing nodes to spuriously wakeup in order to receive nonexistent transmissions. In empirical studies in residential environments, we observe that the false wakeup problem can significantly increase a node's duty cycle, compromising the benefit of LPL. We also find that the energy-level threshold used by the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) mechanism to detect channel activity has a significant impact on the false wakeup rate. We then design AEDP, an adaptive energy detection protocol for LPL, which dynamically adjusts a node's CCA threshold to improve network reliability and duty cycle based on application-specified bounds. Empirical experiments in both controlled tests and real-world environments showed AEDP can effectively mitigate the impact of noise on radio duty cycles, while maintaining satisfactory link reliability.},

 abstract = {Buildings account for 40% of US primary energy consumption and 72% of electricity. Of this total, 50% of the energy consumed in buildings is used for Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Current HVAC systems only condition based on static schedules; rooms are conditioned regardless of occupancy. By conditioning rooms only when necessary, greater efficiency can be achieved. This paper describes POEM, a complete closed-loop system for optimally controlling HVAC systems in buildings based on actual occupancy levels. POEM is comprised of multiple parts. A wireless network of cameras called OPTNet is developed that functions as an optical turnstile to measure area/zone occupancies. Another wireless sensor network of passive infrared (PIR) sensors called BONet functions alongside OPTNet. This sensed occupancy data from both systems are then fused with an occupancy prediction model using a particle filter in order to determine the most accurate current occupancy in each zone in the building. Finally, the information from occupancy prediction models and current occupancy is combined in order to find the optimal conditioning strategy required to reach target temperatures and minimize ventilation requirements. Based on live tests of the system, we estimate ~30.0% energy saving can be achieved while still maintaining thermal comfort.},

This calls for a modular layered sensemaking framework in which low level state classifications of raw data (e.g., estimated activity states such as sitting, walking, driving from continuous accelerometer and location traces), are used to derive mid-level semantic features (e.g., total number of ambulatory minutes, number of hours spent out of house), that can then be mapped to particular behavioral biomarkers for specific diseases (e.g., chronic pain, GI disfunction, MS, fatigue, depression, etc). The techniques needed to derive these markers will range from simple functions to machine learning classifiers, and will need to fuse diverse data types, but all will need to cope with noisy, erratic data sources.

 abstract = {Recent years have witnessed pilot deployments of inexpensive wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for active volcano monitoring. This paper studies the problem of picking arrival times of primary waves (i.e., P-phases) received by seismic sensors, one of the most critical tasks in volcano monitoring. Two fundamental challenges must be addressed. First, it is virtually impossible to download the real-time high-frequency seismic data to a central station for P-phase picking due to limited wireless network bandwidth. Second, accurate P-phase picking is inherently computation-intensive, and is thus prohibitive for many low-power sensor platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a new P-phase picking approach for hierarchical volcano monitoring WSNs where a large number of inexpensive sensors are used to collect fine-grained, real-time seismic signals while a small number of powerful coordinator nodes process collected data and pick accurate P-phases. We develop a suite of new in-network signal processing algorithms for accurate P-phase picking, including lightweight signal pre-processing at sensors, sensor selection at coordinators as well as signal compression and reconstruction algorithms. Testbed experiments and extensive simulations based on real data collected from a volcano show that our approach achieves accurate P-phase picking while only 16% of the sensor data are transmitted.},

 abstract = {Sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder characterized by the repetitive cessation of breathing during sleep, can result in various diseases, including headaches, hypertension, stroke and cardiac arrest, as well as produce severe consequences such as impaired concentration and traffic accidents. A traditional diagnosis method of sleep apnea is polysomnography, which can only be conducted in sleep center with specialized personals, thus is expensive and inconvenient. Moreover, it is only used for understanding the conditions, without treatment function. Some other methods or devices have been developed to alleviate sleep apnea, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and intraoral mandibular advancement device and surgery. However, they only provide a treatment method without detection or monitoring function. There is no existing device which can provide both apnea detection and treatment functionality. In this paper, we propose and implement a smart phone-based auto-adjustable pillow system, which enables both sleep apnea detection and treatment. Sleep apnea events can be detected in real-time using the blood oxygen sensor, accordingly, the height and shape of the pillow can be automatically adjusted to terminate the sleep apnea event. On the other hand, after the adjustment, the sensor can continuously monitor the blood oxygen signal to evaluate the effectiveness of the pillow adjustment and to help in selecting a suitable adjustment scheme. Therefore, a real-time feedback control system is formed. Besides, compared with existing diagnosis or treatment devices, our system is non-invasive, inexpensive and portable, which can be used at home or during traveling. In this paper, a real-time sleep apnea detection and classification algorithm is proposed to decide whether the pillow should be adjusted or not. We also design a real-time feedback pillow adjustment algorithm, to decide when and how to adjust the pillow and how to evaluate the effectiveness of the adjustment. We conducted experiments on 40 patients, which demonstrate that using our novel smart pillow system, both the sleep apnea duration and the number of sleep apnea events are dramatically reduced by more than 50%.},

@inproceedings{Bernauer:2013:CCT:2461381.2461403,
 abstract = {While size and complexity of sensor networks software has increased significantly in recent years, the hardware capabilities of sensor nodes have been remaining very constrained. The predominant event-based programming paradigm addresses these hardware constraints, but does not scale well with the growing software complexity, often leading to software that is hard-to-manage and error-prone. Thread abstractions could remedy this situation, but existing solutions in sensor networks either provide incomplete thread semantics or introduce a significant resource overhead. This reflects the common understanding that one has to trade expressiveness for efficiency and vice versa. Our work, however, shows that this trade-off is not inherent to resource-constrained systems. We propose a comprehensive compiler-assisted cooperative threading abstraction, where full-fledged thread-based C code is translated to efficient event-based C code that runs atop an event-based operating system such as Contiki or TinyOS. Our evaluation shows that our approach outperforms thread libraries and generates code that is almost as efficient as hand-written event-based code with overheads of 1% RAM, 2% CPU, and 3% ROM.},

 abstract = {The paper presents a smartphone-based shooter localization system. As muzzle blasts are difficult to detect at longer distances and consequently present higher false detection rates, the system relies on shockwaves only. Each sensor uses four microphones to detect the Angle of Arrival and the length of the shockwave. This information, along with the sensor's own GPS coordinates, are shared among nearby smartphones. Assuming a known weapon type, it then proceeds to estimate the two possible projectile trajectory candidates for each sensor that are consistent with the observations in the horizontal plane of the sensors. A simple clustering algorithm identifies the correct projectile trajectory relying on as few as two sensors. The trajectory is then used to estimate the bearing to the shooter relative to each sensor. The paper presents the overall system architecture, the design of the sensor node that interfaces with the smartphone, the trajectory and bearing estimation algorithms, and the evaluation of the system based on a field experiment.},

We envision this capability being driven by similarity-based queries posed to a cloud search front-end, which in turn dynamically retrieves media objects from mobile devices that best match the respective queries within a given time limit. Building upon a crowd-sensing framework, we have designed and implemented a system called MediaScope that provides this capability. MediaScope is an extensible framework that supports nearest-neighbor and other geometric queries on the feature space (e.g. clusters, spanners), and contains novel retrieval algorithms that attempt to maximize the retrieval of relevant information. From experiments on a prototype, MediaScope is shown to achieve near-optimal query completeness and low to moderate overhead on mobile devices.},

Such interference has been shown to significantly degrade network performance. We present SoNIC, a system that enables resource-limited sensor nodes to detect the type of interference they are exposed to and select an appropriate mitigation strategy. The key insight underlying SoNIC is that different interferers disrupt individual 802.15.4 packets in characteristic ways that can be detected by sensor nodes. In contrast to existing approaches to interference detection, SoNIC does not rely on active spectrum sampling or additional hardware, making it lightweight and energy-efficient. In an office environment with multiple interferers, a sensor node running SoNIC correctly detects the predominant interferer 87% of the time. To show how sensor networks can benefit from SoNIC, we add it to a mobile sink application to improve the application's packet reception ratio under interference.},

 abstract = {Welcome to IPSN 2012, the Eleventh ACM/IEEE Conference on Information Processing in Sensing Networks! This year marks the first time IPSN is held in Asia, recognizing the region's growing interest and activities in the areas of sensor networks, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). We hope that you will enjoy this diverse conference that is a leading venue for publications and idea exchange on sensor networks. IPSN is unique in its broad coverage of the field, ranging from foundations to system implementation and platforms. It is a meeting point of theory and practice, as embodied in its two tracks: Information Processing (IP) and Sensor Platforms, Tools and Design Methods (SPOTS). In an effort to further unify the conference this year, we formed a joint technical program committee (TPC) and held a single TPC meeting. Authors could select the IP or the SPOTS track for their submissions and TPC members were able to provide their review preferences across all papers submitted to the conference. We believe that in this way, each paper received the most relevant and useful set of reviews. The field of sensor networks has shown a continuing strength over the years as indicated by the number and the quality of submissions this year: 53 in the SPOTS track and 94 in the IP track, for a total of 147 submissions. These submissions underwent a two-stage review process during which each paper received at least three reviews and occasionally up to seven reviews. An online discussion followed the review process during which the set of papers that were discussed in the TPC meeting were selected. The set of accepted papers were decided during a face-to-face TPC meeting. 22 papers were selected for publication out of which 12 were in the IP track and 10 in the SPOTS track. As in the past, the exciting demo and poster session provides an opportunity for attendees to examine and discuss the latest in sensing devices, systems and applications, following a special session with a rapid-fire series of short "pitch" talks from the authors of posters and demos. A new addition to the program this year is the PhD Forum where students working in the field present their dissertation ideas and get critical feedback from a panel of experts. The main conference is complemented by a number of workshops and tutorials in emerging or adjacent areas of sensor networks such as mobile, IoT, and smart objects.},

 abstract = {Micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) swarms are emerging as a new class of mobile sensor networks with many potential applications such as urban surveillance, disaster response, radiation monitoring, etc., where the swarm is tasked with collaboratively covering a hazardous unknown environment. However, efficient collaborative coverage is challenging due to limited individual sensing, computing and communication resources of MAV sensor nodes, and lack of location infrastructure in the unknown application environment. We present SugarMap, a novel system that enables such resource-constrained MAV nodes to achieve efficient sensing coverage. The self-establishing system uses approximate motion models of mobile nodes in conjunction with radio signatures from self-deployed stationary anchor nodes to create a common coverage map. Consequently, the system coordinates node movements to reduce sensing overlap and increase the speed and efficiency of coverage. The system uses particle filters to account for uncertainty in sensors and actuation of MAV nodes, and incorporates redundancy to guarantee coverage. Through large-scale simulations and a real implementation on the SensorFly MAV sensing platform, we show that SugarMap provides better coverage than the existing coverage approaches for MAV swarms.},

The use of inertial sensors and short-range radio can reduce reliance on GPS to prolong the operational lifetime of tracking devices, but they only provide coarse-grained control over GPS activity. In this paper, we introduce our feature-rich lightweight Camazotz platform as an enabler of Multimodal Activity-based Localisation~(MAL), which detects activities of interest by combining multiple sensor streams for fine-grained control of GPS sampling times. Using the case study of long-term flying fox tracking, we characterise the tracking, connectivity, energy, and activity recognition performance of our module under both static and 3-D mobile scenarios. We use Camazotz to collect empirical flying fox data and illustrate the utility of individual and composite sensor modalities in classifying activity. We evaluate MAL for flying foxes through simulations based on retrospective empirical data. The results show that multimodal activity-based localisation reduces the power consumption over periodic GPS and single sensor-triggered GPS by up to 77% and 14% respectively, and provides a richer event type dissociation for fine-grained control of GPS sampling.},

Up until now, there has been no simple way to directly measure ball screw for knowing the state of wear quantitatively. An indirect approach is logging all the signals (vibration, temperature, and preload change) during the operation of ball screw, and to use them to construct the wear model for estimating its remaining lifetime. To achieve this goal, we proposed a cloud-based logging system in this study that emphasizes (1) logging all the signals during operation in a ball screw's whole lifetime, and transferring to the data server without data loss; and (2) saving all the data into the cloud data storage of the ball screw's manufacturer. The data collected from many ball screws can be used to analyze and construct the wear model of ball screw, allowing the manufacturer to understand the state of wear and send a warning to the tool machine's owner before excessive wear.},

These two types of sensors can calculate human's velocity and position independently, which are used as information for both indentifying and tracking the target.

While larger networks with greater sensor density promise to allow us to use noisier sensors yet measure subtler phenomena, aggregating data and designing decision rules is challenging. Motivated by dense, participatory seismic networks, we seek efficient aggregation methods for event detection. We propose to perform aggregation by sparsification: roughly, a sparsifying basis is a linear transformation that aggregates measurements from groups of sensors that tend to co-activate, and each event is observed by only a few groups of sensors. We show how a simple class of sparsifying bases provably improves detection with noisy binary sensors, even when only qualitative information about the network is available. We then describe how detection can be further improved by learning a better sparsifying basis from network observations or simulations. Learning can be done offline, and makes use of powerful off-the-shelf optimization packages. Our approach outperforms state of the art detectors on real measurements from seismic networks with hundreds of sensors, and on simulated epidemics in the Gnutella P2P communication network.},

 abstract = {Metrics that aggregate the state of neighboring nodes are frequently used in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we present two primitives that exploit simultaneous communications in 802.15.4 radios to enable a polling node to calculate with low power the number (or set) of its neighbors where some state predicate of interest holds. In both primitives, the poller assigns transmission powers and response lengths to its respective neighbors for their simultaneous response to each of its poll requests. The two primitives adopt complementary schemes for power assignment such that the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of the respective signal from each neighbor is significantly different from that of all others in one primitive and nearly equivalent to that of the others in the other. The first primitive, LinearPoll, suits sparse networks and consumes energy that is linear in the size of its neighborhood, whereas the second primitive, LogPoll, suits dense networks and consumes constant energy. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions that use multiple sub-carriers, our primitives are simpler and more compute-efficient while provide estimation with comparable quality. Compared to single-carrier solutions, our primitives achieve comparable quality at less than half the energy cost or richer information at comparable energy cost. They are also compatible with other radio physical layers. Based on our implementation for CC2420 radios on the TelosB platform, we evaluate the primitives in different wireless environments and neighborhood topologies to study their performance, the tradeoff between their estimation accuracy and energy cost, and methods for tuning their critical parameters, and we compare them with baseline counting protocols.},

When multiple subjects are present, our objective is to use the profiling data collected by a single subject to count and localize multiple subjects without any extra effort. In order to address the non-linearity of the impact of multiple subjects, we propose a successive cancellation based algorithm to iteratively determine the number of subjects. We model indoor human trajectories as a state transition process, exploit indoor human mobility constraints and integrate all information into a conditional random field (CRF) to simultaneously localize multiple subjects. As a result, we call the proposed algorithm SCPL -- sequential counting, parallel localizing. We test SCPL with two different indoor settings, one with size 150 m2 and the other 400 m2. In each setting, we have four different subjects, walking around in the deployed areas, sometimes with overlapping trajectories. Through extensive experimental results, we show that SCPL can count the present subjects with 86% counting percentage when their trajectories are not completely overlapping. Our localization algorithms are also highly accurate, with an average localization error distance of 1.3 m.},

@inproceedings{Bajwa:2013:IWW:2461381.2461397,
 abstract = {Truck weight data is used in many areas of transportation such as weight enforcement and pavement condition assessment. This paper describes a wireless sensor network (WSN) that estimates the weight of moving vehicles from pavement vibrations caused by vehicular motion. The WSN consists of: acceleration sensors that report pavement vibration; vehicle detection sensors that report a vehicle's arrival and departure times; and an access point (AP) that synchronizes all the sensors and records the sensor data. The paper also describes a novel algorithm that estimates a vehicle's weight from pavement vibration and vehicle detection data, and calculates pavement deflection in the process. A prototype of the system has been deployed near a conventional Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) system on I-80 W in Pinole, CA. Weights of 52 trucks at different speeds and loads were estimated by the system under different pavement temperatures and varying environmental conditions, adding to the challenges the system must overcome. The error in load estimates was less than 10% for gross weight and 15% for individual axle weights. Different states have different requirements for WIM but the system described here outperformed the nearby conventional WIM, and meets commonly used standards in United States. The system also opens up exciting new opportunities for WSNs in pavement engineering and intelligent transportation.},

 abstract = {The monitoring of electrical and water fixtures in the home is being applied for a variety of "smart home" applications, such as recognizing activities of daily living (ADLs) or conserving energy or water usage. Fixture monitoring techniques generally fall into two categories: fixture recognition and fixture disaggregation. However, existing techniques require users to explicitly identify each individual fixture, either by placing a sensor on it or by manually creating training data for it. In this paper, we present a new fixture discovery system that automatically infers the existence of electrical and water fixtures in the home. We call the system FixtureFinder. The basic idea is to use data fusion between the smart meters and other sensors or infrastructure already in the home, such as the home security or automation system, and to find repeating patterns in the fused data stream. To evaluate FixtureFinder, we deployed the system into 4 different homes for 7-10 days of data collection. Our results show that FixtureFinder is able to identify and differentiate major light and water fixtures in less than 10 days, including multiple copies of light bulbs and sinks that have identical power/water profiles.},

 abstract = {Limited visibility into the global network state renders testing and debugging sensor network applications a challenging task. Existing debugging methods are often non-intrusive and require modifications of the binary image. Hardware based debugging instrumentation such as JTAG has not been widely used beyond a single node, mainly due to its relatively high cost and lack of software support for distributed debugging. This demonstration presents a novel architecture for distributed debugging of wireless sensor networks using a low-cost extension board to access the on-chip debug module of the node's processor. Connecting several of those debug boards using a backbone network provides distributed control and monitoring of the sensor network in test.},

An algorithm is used to calculate the distance of a person from each sensor node based on its temperature reading and locate the person based on a combination of the sensor readings from the distributed nodes. This method is immune to lighting changes and works even in total darkness. Furthermore, this method of sensing can also detect events such as a person walking past the doorway to a room, lingering outside, and entering or leaving the room.},

The TKN-TWN uses two tokens to arbitrate data-packet transmissions and associates the ownership of tokens with transmission slot assignment. For the reduction of scheduling burden, the TKN-TWN provides topology adaptability while maintaining high throughput in burst data transfer. In this paper, we present the system design of TKN-TWN with enhancement toward topology adaptability based on a previous work. We evaluate TKN-TWN on a local test bed using 31 TelosB sensor nodes. Evaluation results show that the TKN-TWN achieves throughput of 6.4 KByte/s with more than 99% delivery ratio even with occasional node failures.},

@proceedings{Wolisz:2014:2602339,
 abstract = {Welcome to the 13th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN 2014) in Berlin, Germany. IPSN is one of the flagship research conferences of the networked sensing and control community, and continues to serve as a major forum for cutting edge research results. In IPSN 2014, we made a few changes from the past years. First, we merged the Information Processing (IP) and the Sensor Platforms, Tools and Design Methods (SPOTS) tracks. Over the years, SPOTS track has fostered the research and dissemination of networked sensor platforms and design tools. It is a stable and integral part of the conference. We no longer need to call it out as a separate track. In IPSN 2014, although the authors may indicate whether their submissions are targeted for IP or SPOTS track, the reviews were assigned across tracks to the most appropriate reviewers. Among accepted papers, one third are labeled as SPOTS submissions by the authors, a similar ration of those in the submissions. Another change in IPSN 2014 was an experimental call for Challenge papers. The goal of these papers is to motivate the research community to think about new directions and future challenges. We received five challenge paper submissions, but none has passed the rigorous review process. This year, we received 111 submissions spanning across all areas of network sensors and information processing. These papers are from 5 continents, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. The reviews were handled in two phases. In the first phase, all papers received three reviews. All papers with at least one weak accept recommendation entered the second phase, where they received at least two more reviews. A physical TPC meeting was held in Houston, TX, USA, where 46 papers were discussed by the committee. In the end, 23 papers were accepted to appear in the final program. The acceptance rate is 20.7%. Then, each paper was shepherded by a TPC member to ensure that the final versions meet the highest publication quality. In the entire review process, we handled conflict of interests seriously. TPC members were blocked from reading the reviews and listening to discussions on papers that they have conflict with. Two papers co-authored by a TPC chair were handled out of the review system.},

Nemo transmits real-time power measurement to the host node solely through the power line, by modulating the current load and the supply voltage. This feature leads to a noninvasive, plug & play design that allows Nemo to be easily installed on existing mote platforms without physical wiring or soldering.
