 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2013 ACM International Symposium on FPGAs (FPGA 2013). This year's symposium continues its tradition of being a premier forum for the presentation of FPGA-related research across a wide variety of topics: new FPGA architectures and circuit designs, enhancements to Computer-Aided Design (CAD) algorithms and flows, applications well-suited to FPGAs, and design studies. In addition to facilitating the sharing of research results through the paper and poster presentations, FPGA provides an excellent opportunity for researchers from around the world to mingle and discuss research results and ideas. This year we received 106 submissions from twenty-one countries. The program committee accepted 24 full (ten page) and 4 short (four page) papers, each of which are published in the proceedings, for an acceptance rate of 26%. Full papers will each also have a twenty-minute oral presentation, while short papers will have a five-minute oral presentation, followed by a poster presentation at which attendees can further discuss the work with the authors. Finally we will have four poster sessions in which a total of 37 additional research projects will be displayed on posters, and at which you may ask detailed questions of the authors. This year the symposium begins with a day of tutorials related to high-level synthesis and design flows for FPGAs. A total of four tutorials will be presented in two parallel tracks, and the threehour length of each tutorial allows an in-depth presentation on each of the four design flows and tools. The symposium also includes an evening panel moderated by Jason Cong of UCLA on the question of "Are FPGAs Suffering from the Innovator's Dilemna?" Bring your questions for our panel of industry experts, and enjoy a lively discussion on whether the barriers to entry to the FPGA industry are helping or harming innovation.},
