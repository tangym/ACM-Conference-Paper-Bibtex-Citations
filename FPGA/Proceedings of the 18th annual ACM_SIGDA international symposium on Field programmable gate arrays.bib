 abstract = {FPGA 2010 is the 18th annual meeting of the ACM International Symposium on Field- Programmable Gate Arrays. As we gather again in Monterey, CA, we welcome you to this premier conference for the presentation of the latest research and advances in all areas related to FPGAs. This year, we received 96 submissions from which we selected 24 excellent quality full papers for presentation at the Symposium (acceptance rate of 25%). This cohort of full-length papers provides a balanced program with strong contributions in the three areas of FPGA architecture (4), CAD tools (7) and applications (13). In an effort to widen participation, we started last year a new category known as "short papers", each having a 4-page publication, a short (5 minutes) presentation and a poster presentation. In all, 10 short papers were chosen. We will also have over 30 poster presentations that provide additional opportunities for researchers to present their work. Delegates to this year's Symposium will enjoy an interesting pre-conference workshop on "Open-Source for FPGA," and an interesting debate during the Panel Session on Monday evening on "Programming High Performance Signal Processing Systems in High Level Languages."},
