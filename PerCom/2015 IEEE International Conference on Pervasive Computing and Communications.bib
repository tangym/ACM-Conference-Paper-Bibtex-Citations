year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={Summary form only given. Socially assistive robotics (SAR) is a new subfield of robotics that bridges human-robot interaction (HRI), rehabilitation robotics, social robotics, and service robotics. SAR focuses on developing machines capable of assisting users, typically in health and education contexts, through social rather than physical interaction. The robot's physical embodiment is at the heart of SAR's effectiveness, as it leverages the inherently human tendency to engage with lifelike (but not necessarily humanlike or otherwise biomimetic) social behavior. This talk will describe research into embodiment, modeling and steering social dynamics, and long-term user adaptation for SAR. The research will be grounded in projects involving analysis of multi-modal activity data, modeling personality and engagement, formalizing social use of space and non-verbal communication, and personalizing the interaction with the user over a period of months. The presented methods and algorithms will be validated on implemented SAR systems evaluated by human subject cohorts from a variety of user populations, including stroke patients, children with autism spectrum disorder, and elderly with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia.},

volume={},

pages={2-10}, 
abstract={We present a framework to mine relations and group variables that represent measurement and status information from sensors and actuators in office buildings. Our work is motivated by the need to manage growing numbers of devices and related automation functions in buildings that are currently often manually commissioned and maintained. Our approach relies on the idea that building variables at the same location will change value in a temporal relation that can be discovered. Based on event sequences derived from various variables and modalities, our approach initially mines temporal association rules and subsequently groups variables. We propose a weighted transitive clustering (WTC) algorithm to automatically group co-located building variables. To validate our approach, we used living-lab office recordings across 14 months from three different office rooms. We compare our approach against a random guess baseline, a hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) approach, and the rules of a manually configured building management system (BMS). We found that within three months of operation, 75% of the building variables could be grouped. Our WTC approach outperforms the baseline and HAC. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be used develop different BMS applications, including counting people in building spaces and identifying BMS configuration errors.},

abstract={Place labeling is the process of giving semantic labels to locations, such as home, work, and school. For a particular person, these labels can be computed automatically based on features of that person's visits to these locations. A previous system called Placer used the person's demographic data and the timing of their visits to label places with a learned decision tree. We developed Placer++ as a more accurate labeler, augmenting Placer's features of individual visits with (1) labeled visits from other people and (2) features about the sequence of the individual's visits. In processing sequences, we adopt structural learning techniques to take into account the relationships between visits. Accuracy increased by 8.85 percentage points over the baseline of Placer. We describe and justify the features and present our experiments on government diary data.},

abstract={Smart sensors, such as smart meters or smart phones, are nowadays ubiquitous. To be “smart”, however, they need to process their input data with limited storage and computational resources. In this paper, we convert the stream of sensor data into a stream of symbols, and further, to higher level symbols in such a way that common analytical tasks such as anomaly detection, forecasting or state recognition, can still be carried out on the transformed data with almost no loss of accuracy, and using far fewer resources. We identify states of a monitored system and convert them into symbols (thus, reducing data size), while keeping “interesting” events, such as anomalies or transition between states, as it is. Our algorithm is able to find states of various length in an online and unsupervised way, which is crucial since behavior of the system is not known beforehand. We show the effectiveness of our approach using real-world datasets and various application scenarios.},

title={Energy modeling of system settings: A crowdsourced approach}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={37-45}, 
abstract={The question “Where has my battery life gone?” remains a common source of frustration for many smartphone users. With the increased complexity of smartphone applications, and the increasing number of system settings affecting them, understanding and optimizing battery use has become a difficult chore. The present paper develops a novel approach for constructing energy models from crowdsourced measurements. In contrast to previous approaches, which have focused on the effect of a specific sensor, system setting or application, our approach can simultaneously capture relationships between multiple factors, and provide a unified view of the energy state of the mobile device. We demonstrate the validity of using crowdsourced measurements for constructing battery models through a combination of large-scale analysis of a dataset containing battery discharge and system state measurements and hardware power measurements. The results indicate that the models captured by our approach are both in line with previous studies on battery consumption and empirical measurements, providing a cost-effective way to construct energy models during normal operations of the device. The analysis also provides several new insights about battery consumption. For example, our analysis shows the energy use of high CPU activity with automatic screen brightness is actually higher (resulting in around 9 minutes shorter battery lifetime on average) than with a medium CPU load and manual screen brightness; a Wi-Fi signal strength drop of one bar can result in a battery life loss of over 13%; and a smartphone sitting in the sun can experience over 50% worse battery life than one indoors in cool conditions.},

year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={46-54}, 
abstract={Electricity and appliance usage information can often reveal the nature of human activities in a home. For instance, sensing the use of vacuum cleaner, a microwave oven, and kitchen appliances can give insights into a person's current activities. Instead of putting a sensor on each appliance, our technique is based on the idea that appliance usage can be sensed by their manifestations in an environment's existing electrical infrastructure. Prior approaches using this technique could only detect an appliance's on-off states; that is, they only sense “what” is being used, but not “how” it is used. In this paper, we introduce DOSE, a significant advancement for inferring operating states of electronic devices from a single sensing point in a home. When an electronic device is in operation, it generates time-varying Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) based upon its operating states (e.g., vacuuming on a rug vs. hardwood floor). This EMI noise is coupled to the power line and can be picked up from a single sensing hardware attached to the wall outlet in a house. Unlike prior data-driven approaches, we employ domain knowledge of the device's circuitry for semi-supervised model training to avoid tedious labeling process. We evaluated DOSE in a residential house for 2 months and found that operating states for 16 appliances could be estimated with an average accuracy of 93.8%. These fine-grained electrical characteristics affords rich feature sets of electrical events and have the potential to support various applications such as in-home activity inference, energy disaggregation and device failure detection.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel task allocation framework, CrowdTasker, for mobile crowdsensing. CrowdTasker operates on top of energy-efficient Piggyback Crowdsensing (PCS) task model, and aims to maximize the coverage quality of the sensing task while satisfying the incentive budget constraint. In order to achieve this goal, CrowdTasker first predicts the call and mobility of mobile users based on their historical records. With a flexible incentive model and the prediction results, CrowdTasker then selects a set of users in each sensing cycle for PCS task participation, so that the resulting solution achieves near-maximal coverage quality without exceeding incentive budget. We evaluated CrowdTasker extensively using a large-scale real-world dataset and the results show that CrowdTasker significantly outperformed three baseline approaches by achieving 3%-60% higher coverage quality.},

title={Acoustic based appliance state identifications for fine-grained energy analytics}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={63-70}, 
abstract={Fine-grained monitoring of everyday appliances can provide better feedback to the consumers and motivate them to change behavior in order to reduce their energy usage. It also helps to detect abnormal power consumption events, long-term appliance malfunctions and potential safety concerns. Commercially available plug meters can be used for individual appliance monitoring but for an entire house, each such individual plug meters are expensive and tedious to setup. Alternative methods relying on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring techniques help disaggregate electricity consumption data and learn about the individual appliance's power states and signatures. However fine-grained events (e.g., appliance malfunctions, abnormal power consumption, etc.) remain undetected and thus inferred contexts (such as safety hazards etc.) become invisible. In this work, we correlate an appliance's inherent acoustic noise with its energy consumption pattern individually and in presence of multiple appliances. We initially investigate classification techniques to establish the relationship between appliance power and acoustic states for efficient energy disaggregation and abnormal events detection. While promising, this approach fails when there are multiple appliances simultaneously in `ON' state. To further improve the accuracy of our energy disaggregation algorithm, we propose a probabilistic graphical model, based on a variation of Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) for multiple appliances energy disaggregation. We combine our probabilistic model with the appliances acoustic analytics and postulate a hybrid model for energy disaggregation. Our approach helps to improve the performance of energy disaggregation algorithms and provide critical insights on appliance longevity, abnormal power consumption, consumer behavior and their everyday lifestyle activities. We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms on real data traces and show that the fusion of acoustic and power sig- atures can successfully detect a number of appliances with 95% accuracy.},

abstract={We introduce a hierarchical nonparametric topic modeling approach to infer activity routines from context sensor data streams based on a distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP). Our approach does not require labeled data at any stage. Neither does our approach depend on time-invariant sliding windows to sample context word statistics. Our activity discovery approach builds on the idea that context words occurring within one activity are semantically similar, whereas context words of different activities are less similar. Context word streams are segmented into supersamples and then semantic and temporal features are obtained to construct a segmentation prior that relates supersamples via its context words. Our hierarchical model uses the segmentation prior and ddCRP to group supersamples and the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) to discover activities. We evaluate our approach using the Opportunity dataset that contains activities of daily living. Besides being nonparametric, our ddCRP based model outperforms both, classic parametric latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and the nonparametric Chinese restaurant franchise (CRF). We conclude that ddCRP+CRP is an adequate approach for fully unsupervised activity discovery from context sensor data.},

year={2015}, 
volume={},

pages={79-86}, 
abstract={Conventional human activity recognition (HAR) relies on accelerometers to frequently sample human motion (acceleration). Unfortunately, power consumption of accelerometers becomes a bottleneck for realising pervasive self-powering HAR as the amount of power that can be practically harvested from the environment is very small. Instead of using accelerometer, this paper advocates the use of energy harvesting power signal as the source of HAR when motion (kinetic) energy is being harvested to power the device. The proposed use of harvested power for classifying human activities is motivated by the fact that different activities produce kinetic energy in a different way leaving their signatures in the harvested power signal. Using information theoretic analysis of experimental data, we show that many standard statistical features provide significant information gain when the kinetic power signal is used for discriminating between different activities, confirming its potential use for HAR. We have evaluated activity recognition accuracy for kinetic power signal based HAR using 14 different sets of common activities each containing between 2-10 different activities to be classified. HAR accuracies varied between 68% to 100% depending on the set of activities. The average accuracy over all activity sets is 83%, which is within 13% of what could be achieved with an accelerometer without any power constraints.},

pages={87-94}, 
abstract={While mobile and wearable sensing can capture unique insights into fine-grained activities (such as gestures and limb-based actions) at an individual level, their energy overheads are still prohibitive enough to prevent them from being executed continuously. In this paper, we explore practical alternatives to addressing this challenge-by exploring how cheap infrastructure sensors or information sources (e.g., BLE beacons) can be harnessed with such mobile/wearable sensors to provide an effective solution that reduces energy consumption without sacrificing accuracy. The key idea is that many fine-grained activities that we desire to capture are specific to certain location, movement or background context: infrastructure sensors and information sources (e.g., BLE beacons) offer practical and cheap ways to identify such context. In this paper, we first explore how various infrastructure, mobile & wearable sensors can be used to identify fine-grained location/movement context (e.g., transiting through a door). We then show, using a couple of illustrative examples (specifically, the detection of `switch pressing' before exiting a room and the identification of `water drinking' after approaching a water cooler) to show that such background context can be predicted, with sufficient accuracy, with sufficient lead time to enable a `triggered' model for mobile/wearable sensing of such microscopic, transient gestures and activities. Moreover, such `triggered' sensing also helps to improve the accuracy of such microscopic gesture recognition, by reducing the set of candidate activity labels. Empirical experiments show that we are able to identify 82.2% of switch-pressing and 91.73% of water-drinking activities in a campus lab setting, with a significant reduction in active sensing time (up to 92.9% compared to continuous sensing).},

Our evaluation proved the effectiveness of Attelia. A controlled user study showed that notifications at detected breakpoint timing resulted in 46% lower cognitive load compared to randomly-timed notifications. Furthermore, our “in-the-wild” user study with 30 participants for 16 days further validated Attelia's value, with a 33% decrease in cognitive load compared to randomly-timed notifications.},

abstract={It is well recognized that walking while using mobile phones will make people more susceptible at various risks. Existing studies to improve smartphone users' safety are mainly limited to detecting incoming vehicles. They are not able to address some more common and equally dangerous accidents such as trips, falling from stairs, platforms or falling into an open manhole. These hazards are generally caused by sudden change of ground. In this paper, we propose UltraSee, the first system that is able to detect sudden change of ground for pedestrian mobile phone users. UltraSee augments smartphones with a small ultrasonic sensor which can detect the abrupt change of distance ahead. UltraSee also leverages the context information of smartphone usage such as screen status and holding orientation to improve detection accuracy and reduce energy consumption as well as unnecessary alarms. We have carried out extensive experiments in different scenarios and by different users. The results show that UltraSee can achieve accident detection rate of 94% with false positive rate of 4.4% and reduce unnecessary alarms by 90%. In terms of energy consumption, UltraSee costs only about 20% energy compared to the existing works that only rely on smartphone cameras.},

abstract={Mobile device users use applications that require text input. Today there are three primary text input modalities, soft keyboard (SK), speech to text (STT) and Swype. Each of these input modalities have different energy demands, and as a result, their use will have a significant impact on the battery life of the mobile device. Using high-precision power measurement hardware and systematically taking into account the user context, we characterize and compare the energy consumption of these three text input modalities. We show that the length of interaction determines the most energy efficient modality. If the interactions is short, on average less than 30 characters, using the device SK is the most energy efficient. For longer interactions, the use of a STT applications is more energy efficient. Swype is more energy efficient than STT for very short interactions, less than 5 characters on average, but is never as efficient as SK. This is primarily due to STT enabling the users to complete tasks more quickly than when using SK or Swype. We also show that these results are independent of “user style”, the experience of using different input modalities and device characteristics. Finally we show that STT energy efficiency is dependent on application logic of whether speech samples are for a given period of time before transmitting to a server for analysis as opposed to streaming the speech to a sever for analysis. Based on these observations we recommend that the users should use SK for short interactions of less than 30 characters, and STT for longer interactions. In addition, they should use STT applications which uses storing and transmit logic, if they are willing to trade off battery life to QoE. Finally we proposed the development of an adaptive storing and analyze STT to improve the energy efficiency of it.},

abstract={Smartphone sensing research has been advancing at a brisk pace. Yet, current social networking services often only take advantage of location sensing: applications like Foursquare use the phone's GPS and Wi-Fi radios to infer the user's location to simplify checking-in to a place. However, smartphone sensing could be exploited to considerably expand the spectrum of information a user can share with a few clicks with friends: not only the location of an event but activities such as “cooking dinner” or “waiting for a bus” can be predicted and suggested to the user to ease the check-in process. In this paper we show how mobile phone sensing can be used in this sense. For this prediction process to be accurate however, sensors need to be sampled often, with a considerable impact on the phone battery. To alleviate this issue, we explore streams of phone usage data (soft sensors), such as application usage, messages, and phone calls for predicting the user's activity in a more efficient fashion for augmenting mobile social check-in apps. We have deployed our application and collected a dataset of over 2700 check-ins to 48 activities from 20 users. Our analysis shows a prediction accuracy of 75% when offering 5 check-in suggestions to users. Furthermore, we show that when using only soft sensors we can achieve very similar performance to that obtained with real sensors, thereby significantly reducing the impact on the phone battery. This finding might have a potentially high impact on smartphone based activity check-in apps.},

abstract={Sensing respiration rate has many applications in monitoring various health conditions, such as sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this paper, we present WiBreathe, a wireless, high fidelity and non-invasive breathing monitor that leverages wireless signals at 2.4 GHz to estimate an individual's respiration rate. Our work extends past approaches of using wireless signals for respiratory monitoring by using only a single transmitter-receiver pair at the same frequency range of commodity Wi-Fi signals to estimate the respiratory rate of an individual. This is done irrespective of whether they are in line of sight or not (e.g., through walls). Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of WiBreathe in detecting multiple people and by extension, their respiration rates. We evaluate our approach in various natural environments and show that we can track breathing with the accuracy of 1.54 breaths per minute when compared to a clinical respiratory chest band.},

abstract={Exergaming as a tool to combat obesity yields an interesting take on the problem of design and implementation of activity recognition systems for truly mobile games that achieve moderate levels of intensity. This work presents SoccAR, a mobile, sensor-based wearable exergaming system with fine-grain activity recognition. The system in this paper presents a recognition algorithm for the appropriate classification of 26 movements by extracting a large number of features and selecting the most important, as well as developing a multiple model strategy to better classify movements. This movement strategy allows for a trade off of detailed classification versus classification speed. A metric to define the accuracy in terms of the importance of particular movements is defined. The scheme presented develops a framework for more accurately classifying movements with a smaller number of features for a large, multiclass real-time environment. This results in a more accurate classification of movements, with an F-score in cross-validation of .937 using a PUK-kernel based SVM and multiple models, to .755 using only a single RBF-based model and 20 features.},

pages={149-154}, 
abstract={According to the World Health Organization, the rate of people aged 60 or more is growing faster than any other age group in almost every country, and this trend is not going to change in a near future. Since senior citizens are at high risk of non communicable diseases requiring long-term care, this trend will challenge the sustainability of the entire health system. Pervasive computing can provide innovative methods and tools for early detecting the onset of health issues. In this paper we propose a novel method relying on medical models, provided by cognitive neuroscience researchers, describing abnormal activity routines that may indicate the onset of early symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. A non-intrusive sensor-based infrastructure acquires low-level data about the interaction of the individual with home appliances and furniture, as well as data from environmental sensors. Based on those data, a novel hybrid statistical-symbolical technique is used to detect first the activities being performed and then the abnormal aspects in carrying out those activities, which are communicated to the medical center. Differently from related works, our method can detect abnormal behaviors at a fine-grained level, thus providing an important tool to support the medical diagnosis. In order to evaluate our method we have developed a prototype of the system and acquired a large dataset of abnormal behaviors carried out in an instrumented smart home. Experimental results show that our technique has a high precision while generating a small number of false positives.},

abstract={We present a novel sensor system for the support of nutrition monitoring. The system is based on smart table cloth equipped with a fine grained pressure textile matrix and a weight sensitive tablet. Unlike many other nutrition monitoring approaches, our system is unobtrusive, non privacy invasive and easily deployable in every day life. It allows the spotting and recognition of food intake related actions, such as cutting, scooping, stirring, etc., the identification of the plate/container on which the action is executed, and the tracking of the weight change in the containers. In other words, we can determine how many pieces are cut on the main dish plate, how many are taken from the side dish, how many sips are taken from the drink, how fast the food is being consumed and how much weight is taken overall. In addition, the distinction between different eating actions, such as cutting, scooping, poking, provides clues to the type of food taken and the way the meal is consumed. We have evaluated our system on 40 meals (5 subjects) in a real life living environment: for seven eating related actions (cutting, scooping, stirring, etc.), resulting in above 90% average recognition rate for person dependent cases, and spotting each action out of continuous data streams (average F1 score 87%).},

pages={163-171}, 
abstract={Current outdoor localization techniques fail to provide the required accuracy for estimating the car's lane. In this paper, we present LaneQuest: a system that leverages the ubiquitous and low-energy inertial sensors available in commodity smart-phones to provide an accurate estimate of the car's current lane. LaneQuest leverages hints from the phone sensors about the surrounding environment to detect the car's lane. For example, a car making a right turn most probably will be in the right-most lane, a car passing by a pothole will be in a specific lane, and the car's angular velocity when driving through a curve reflects its lane. Our investigation shows that there are amble opportunities in the environment, i.e. lane “anchors”, that provide cues about the car's lane. To handle the ambiguous location, sensors noise, and fuzzy lane anchors; LaneQuest employs a novel probabilistic lane estimation algorithm. Furthermore, it uses an unsupervised crowd-sourcing approach to learn the position and lane-span distribution of the different lane-level anchors. Our evaluation results from implementation on different android devices and 260Km driving traces by 13 drivers in different cities shows that LaneQuest can detect the different lane-level anchors with an average precision and recall of more than 90%. This leads to an accurate detection of the exact car's lane position 80% of the time, increasing to 89% of the time to within one lane. This comes with a low-energy footprint, allowing LaneQuest to be implemented on the energy-constrained mobile devices.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel Frequency-divided Instantaneous Neighbors Estimation (FINE) system specifically designed for density estimation in Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) based vehicular networks. A large amount of vehicular applications such as navigation, traffic control, and data dissemination substantially rely on the density information. Recent works pay great attention to obtain the real-time density information and reduce the occupation time of DSRC channel. The state-of-the-art approach is the Framed Slotted ALOHA (FSA) framework, which benefits from its fine-grained time division design. However, FSA considers only time resource and is unaware of the frequency resource in DSRC. For further accelerating the density acquisition, we propose a frequency-divided approach. The core idea of FINE is to resort fine-grained channel division for parallel neighbors counting. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate FINE. The results demonstrate that FINE significantly outperforms existing methods. In a typical dense scenario, FINE reduces the time cost from 2 ms (FSA) to 50 μs, while maintains the accuracy at the same level as FSA.},

abstract={“What would have happened, had I taken the alternative route?” This is a question that many drivers often ponder, hoping that their chosen route is the best. This paper proposes DoppelDriver, a system that attempts to answer such questions on non-chosen alternative routes to a given destination by determining actual times of arrival (ATAs) from participatory users on the non-chosen routes. DoppelDriver offers a direct, actual travel time comparison among route choices. With DoppelDriver's collection of actual travel time comparisons, users will be able to make strategic decisions on, and self-assessments of, their route choices. Also, we describe the potential usage and benefits of ex-post feedback (i.e. travel time on non-chosen routes) and how snapshots of travel time comparisons can be used to support strategic decision making on the choice of a route. Using real taxi GPS data, we investigate whether aggregating ATAs for road segments from other users mimics the ATA for the intended origin-to-destination route. Finally, we present our system design for a prototype implemented on the Android platform.},

abstract={Modern mobile devices come with an array of sensors that support many interesting applications. However, sensors have different sampling costs (e.g., battery drain) and benefits (e.g., accuracy) under different circumstances. In this work we investigate the trade-off between the cost of using a sensor and the benefit gained from its use, with application to data-driven authentication on mobile devices. Current authentication practice, where user behaviour is first learned from the sensor data and then used to detect anomalies, typically assumes a fixed sampling rate and does not consider the battery consumption and usefulness of sensors. In this work we study how battery consumption and sensor effectiveness (e.g., for detecting attacks) vary when using different sensors and different sensor sampling rates. We use data from both controlled lab studies, as well as field trials, for our experiments. We also propose an adaptive sampling technique that adjusts the sampling rate based on an expected device vigilance level. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the battery consumption tenfold without significantly impacting the detection of attacks.},

pages={198-206}, 
abstract={Home automation and environmental control is a key ingredient of smart homes. While systems for home automation and control exist, there are few systems that interact with individuals suffering from paralysis, paresis, weakness and limited range of motion that are common sequels resulting from severe injuries such as stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury and many chronic (guillian barre syndrome) and degenerative (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) conditions. To address this problem, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Inviz, a low-cost gesture recognition system for paralysis patients that uses flexible textile-based capacitive sensor arrays for movement detection. The design of Inviz presents two novel research contributions. First, the system uses flexible textile-based capacitive arrays as proximity sensors that are minimally obtrusive and can be built into clothing for gesture and movement detection in patients with limited body motion. The proximity sensing obviates the need for touch-based gesture recognition that can cause skin abrasion in paralysis patients, and the array of capacitive sensors help provide better spatial resolution and noise cancellation. Second, Inviz uses a low-power hierarchical signal processing algorithm that breaks down computation into multiple low and high power tiers. The tiered approach provides maximal vigilance at minimal energy consumption. We have designed and implemented a fully functional prototype of Inviz and we evaluate it in the context of an end-to-end home automation system and show that it achieves high accuracy while maintaining low latency and low energy consumption.},

year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={207-214}, 
abstract={The understanding of mass population movements has greatly advanced with the rapid spread of ubiquitous devices. Anonymized call detail records (CDRs) for mobile phones have enabled us to not only trace individual trajectories but also approximate activity patterns, including significant locations such as homes and workplaces. The majority of studies analyzing CDRs attempt to utilize the mobility patterns of anonymized crowds to improve transportation and public health. This is quite reasonable because CDRs can capture the movements of people at given times and places, whereas general statistics usually account for a population based on their locations of residence. However, it has also been pointed out that there are discrepancies between the movements of people as observed through CDRs and those of an entire population in a given area. This is because CDRs only represent device users. In fact, we can never learn about the population that is unobservable through CDRs only by analyzing CDRs. Therefore, this study attempts to provide clues to help us understand the whereabouts of the unobservable population by analyzing two months of the CDRs for 58 volunteers with mobile device service from a major telecommunications company in combination with field survey data from Dhaka. We surveyed the personal and household attributes of mobile users in relation to their calling behavior. The analysis results show that per mobile user observed in CDRs, there is an average of roughly 2.4 to 2.8 unobservable people. Their age groups and gender composition are also provided. We find that male and female users exhibit opposite trends in call locations according to the presence of children within the household. In addition, based on field observations, we find that the location and time distributions of small children follow some specific routines. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the whereabouts of the unobservable population, the majority of whom are children and a- e considered to be vulnerable to disasters or infectious diseases but are difficult to locate through CDRs alone.},

abstract={Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect people from being infected by infectious disease. However, it is often impractical to vaccinate all people in a community due to various resource constraints. Therefore, targeted vaccination, which vaccinates a small group of people, is an alternative approach to contain infectious disease spread. To achieve better performance in targeted vaccination, we collect student contact traces in a high school based on wireless sensors carried by students. With our wireless sensor system, we can record student contacts within the disease propagation distance, and then construct a disease propagation graph to model the infectious disease propagation. Based on this graph, we propose a metric called connectivity centrality to measure a node's importance during disease propagation and design centrality based algorithms for targeted vaccination. The proposed algorithms are evaluated and compared with other schemes based on our collected traces. Trace driven simulation results show that our algorithms can help to effectively contain infectious disease.},

Specifically, we focus on the use of transparent gestures to prevent the misuse of three critical smartphone capabilities - the phone calling service, the camera resource and the NFC reading functionality. We show how the underlying natural hand movement gestures associated with the three services, calling, snapping and tapping, can be detected in a robust manner using multiple - motion, position and ambient - sensors and machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we collect data from multiple phone models and multiple users in real-life or near real-life scenarios emulating both benign settings as well as adversarial scenarios. Our results show that the three gestures can be detected with a high overall accuracy, and can be distinguished from one another and from other activities (benign or malicious), serving as a viable malware defense.

abstract={Understanding mobile data traffic demands is crucial to the evaluation of strategies addressing the problem of high bandwidth usage and scalability of network resources, brought by the pervasive era. In this paper, we conduct the first detailed measurement-driven modeling of smartphone subscribers' mobile traffic usage in a metropolitan scenario. We use a large-scale dataset collected inside the core of a major 3G network of Mexico's capital. We first analyse individual subscribers routine behavior and observe identical usage patterns on different days. This motivates us to choose one day for studying the subscribers' usage pattern (i.e., “when” and “how much” traffic is generated) in detail. We then classify the subscribers in four distinct profiles according to their usage pattern. We finally model the usage pattern of these four subscriber profiles according to two different journey periods: peak and non-peak hours. We show that the synthetic trace generated by our data traffic model consistently imitates different subscriber profiles in two journey periods, when. compared to the original dataset.},

abstract={Ensuring security in pervasive computing systems is an essential pre-requisite for their deployment. Typically, such systems are reliant on wireless networks for communication; however, whilst a considerable amount of attention has been given to cryptographic mechanisms for securing that wireless link, almost none has been devoted to the creation of covert channels capable of circumventing perimeter security. In systems that embody an element of control, covert channels offer the potential both to leak information that might be considered private and to alter the operation of the system in ways that are undesirable or unsafe. In this paper, we present two novel forms of covert channel designed to leak information from a compromised node within a secured network in ways that are statistically undetectable by other parts of that system. These two attacks rely on: modulation of transmission power, which impacts the RSSI/LQI of a message; and modulation of sensor data in a way that can be seen in the encrypted form of that data. We report the results of an extensive set of practical experiments designed to assess the channel capacity of these covert channels. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the creation of undetectable covert channels is a practical proposition in pervasive computing systems. This, in turn, has implications for key distribution: the use of individual, rather than group, keys is necessary to limit the exposure caused by a successful covert channel attack.},
