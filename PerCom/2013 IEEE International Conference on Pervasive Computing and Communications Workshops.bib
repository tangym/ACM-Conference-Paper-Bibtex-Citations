Specifically, the aim of the WiP session is to provide a forum for early feedback on ongoing research and for discussion of novel, controversial, and thought provoking ideas. This year WiP has aroused a lot of interest. This has been witnessed by a large number of submissions (41 papers), out of which the WiP Program Committee, composed of 13 international researchers, selected 19 papers. In addition, 3 high-quality papers suggested by the main conference program committee have been invited to present their work in the WiP session. Thus, we present 22 high-quality papers that cover various emerging issues in pervasive computing.},

title={Keynote: Context-aware computing in the era of crowd sensing from personal and space context to social and community context}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={Since the seminal work of Schilit and Theimer on context-awareness in 1994, great research progress has been made in context-aware computing field. Due to limited deployment scale of sensors and devices, in early years context-aware computing focused mainly on understanding and exploiting personal context in single smart spaces. As a result of the recent explosion of sensor-equipped mobile phones, the phenomenal growth of Internet and social network services, the broader use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in all types of public transportation, and the extensive deployment of sensor network and WiFi in both indoor and outdoor environments, the digital footprints left by people while interacting with cyber-physical spaces are accumulating with an unprecedented speed and scale. The technology trend towards crowd sensing is creating new challenges and opportunities for context-aware computing - with huge amount, large scale, multi-modal, different granularity, diverse quality of data from various data sources. In this talk, I will present a new research direction called “social and community intelligence (SCI)” as a natural extension of context-aware computing in the era of crowd sensing, with emphasis on extracting community and society level context; in particular I will introduce our work in mining large scale taxi GPS data, mobile phone data and social media data for enabling innovative applications in smart cities. Finally I will briefly summarize the difference between traditional context-aware computing and SCI in terms of data acquisition, modeling, inference, storage and context inferred.},

abstract={We present a technique for detecting floor changes in an indoor environment and improving pedestrian indoor localization and navigation. Our technique relies on barometric pressure sensors commonly available on smartphones and tablets. We developed an algorithm running on smart mobile devices that can be integrated in any indoor localization system to improve accuracy and support 3D navigation. The main novelty of our technique is that it can work in any type of environment, without any prior knowledge of the building layout, it does not require calibration and it is adaptive. Experimental results show that our method can accurately detect floor changes in any condition without requiring any additional work.},

year={2013}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={8-13}, 
abstract={We address a specific, particularly difficult class of activity recognition problems defined by (1) subtle, and hardly discriminative hand motions such as a short press or pull, (2) large, ill defined NULL class (any other hand motion a person may express during normal life), and (3) difficulty of collecting sufficient training data, that generalizes well from one to multiple users. In essence we intend to spot activities such as opening a cupboard, pressing a button, or taking an object from a shelve in a large data stream that contains typical every day activity. We focus on body-worn sensors without instrumenting objects, we exploit available infrastructure information, and we perform a one-to-many-users training scheme for minimal training effort. We demonstrate that a state of the art motion sensors based approach performs poorly under such conditions (Equal Error Rate of 18% in our experiments). We present and evaluate a new multi modal system based on a combination of indoor location with a wrist mounted proximity sensor, camera and inertial sensor that raises the EER to 79%.},

year={2013}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={14-19}, 
abstract={Mobile phones and video game controllers using gesture recognition technologies enable easy and intuitive operations, such as those in drawing objects. Gesture recognition systems generally require several samples of training data before recognition takes place. However, recognition accuracy deteriorates as time passes since the trajectory of the gestures changes due to fatigue or forgetfulness. We investigated the change in gestures and fast found that several samples of gestures were not suitable for training data. Therefore, we propose two methods of finding appropriate data for training. We confirmed that the proposed methods found better training data than the conventional method from the viewpoints of the number of data collected and the accuracy of recognition.},

abstract={The processing capabilities of current smartphones have increased significantly. We propose a distributed and collaborative context prediction approach that exclusively uses current smartphones to automatically collect, process and predict contexts of users. To predict a user's next context, not only her context history is utilised but also context histories of other users are used. The communication between the smartphones of the users is realised using peer-2-peer. Therefore, no centralised server unit is needed to process the context information of the users externally. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and present experimental results that demonstrate the practicality of the proposed architecture.},

abstract={In this paper we describe SP-ACT, a hybrid framework for the derivation of high-level activity interpretations in context-aware environments, by defining a combination of OWL ontologies and SPARQL CONSTRUCT graph patterns. More specifically, the native semantics of OWL is used to formally represent and integrate activity-related information originated from different data sources, whereas SPARQL (SPIN) rules further aggregate activities so as to derive highlevel activity abstractions. The goal of the hybrid framework is to address the limitations of the ontology-based context modelling paradigm in domains that require the recognition of complex context elements, namely, the lack of support for (i) temporal reasoning and (ii) new named individual assertions.},

pages={37-42}, 
abstract={Adaptations of context-aware applications do not always result in behaviours that users expect, due to imperfect sensing of context information and variability in human preferences, etc. This can negatively impact the user experience of applications and compromise the trust users have in them. In order to gain user acceptance it is critical for applications to support intelligibility, so they are capable of justifying their adaptive actions and explaining the decision process of adaptations to their users. Based on these intelligible explanations, users should be able to modify application settings/thresholds to correct any undesirable behaviour. This paper presents a model-based developmental framework that supports intelligibility and user control of context-aware applications. It identifies and exposes the internal middleware models which influence adaptation decisions, and facilitates generations of explanations regarding evaluations of the models. These middleware models include preference models defined using Defeasible Logic, situation abstractions specified using Hidden Markov Models and First Order Logic, and context models developed using Context Modelling Language. The framework also takes into account users' expertise in technology when providing explanations and control to application behaviours.},

abstract={Web TV is making a comeback, as users increasingly co-consume TV related web content on their companion devices (tablets and smartphones) in sync with TV watching. In this `dual screen' experience, users download and invoke TV apps on their companion devices to personalize their Superbowl or American Idol TV experience with a web counterpart. Unfortunately, the added effort in continually finding and invoking one of many TV Apps threatens to undermine the light-weightness of cognitive experience that makes TV addictive. In this paper, we propose a 2nd screen contextual UI that balances the richness of an App driven 2nd screen experience with the simplicity of a desirable TV experience. We further share user feedback that is both reinforcing and surprising in relation to the appropriate and inappropriate uses of context in a living room setting.},

abstract={In machine learning, concept drift can cause the optimal solution to a given problem to change as time passes, leading to less accurate predictions. Concept drift can be sudden, gradual or reoccuring. Understanding the consequences of concept drift is particularly important in human-centric applications where changes in the underlying data and environment are common and unexpected. In order to gain a better understanding of the adverse effects of different types of concept drift on learners, we propose a novel simulation tool that is able to incrementally generate datasets with customisable concept drift by interacting with a human in a game-like setting. We illustrate our approach by generating and analysing concept drift simulations inspired by body-sensor based long-term activity recognition. Our initial results show that current unsupervised adaptation techniques can be caught in cyclic mislabelling and that a hybrid solution that is self-calibrating and semi-supervised is more robust than any of the two taken separately for this example.},

abstract={With the effort to increase renewable energy production, offshore wind power plants become increasingly important. Thus, there is a growing necessity to carry out offshore operations like construction or maintenance of wind power plants. Offshore operations are complex, risky, and therefore prone to accidents. A context aware assistance system might help to increase the safety during these operations. It could observe the status of safety relevant entities with sensors and support crews by displaying status information and triggering warnings in occurrence of critical situations. As the safety relevant entities and the critical situations depend on the executed operation, the assistance system needs to be based on a dynamic and flexible context model. This paper introduces an approach to design an easy adaptable, extendable and deployable context model for an offshore operation assistance system.},

abstract={Large proliferation of mobile phone applications result in extensive use of data intensive services such as multimedia download and social network communication. With limited penetration of 3G/4G networks in developing countries, it is common to use low bandwidth 2G services for data communication, resulting in larger download time and correspondingly high power consumption. In this paper, we present a system architecture, Unity, that enables collaborative downloading across co-located peers. Unity uses short range radio interfaces such as Bluetooth/WiFi for local coordination, while the actual content is downloaded using a cellular connection. Unity is designed to support mobile phones with diverse capabilities. End-to-end implementation and evaluation of Unity on Android based phones, with varying workload sizes and number of peers, show that Unity can result in multifold increase in download rate for the co-located peers. We also describe architecture of cloud-based Unity which uses principles of mobility prediction, social interactions, and opportunistic networking to make collaboration more pervasive and useful.},

This system retrieves similar photographs from an image database of location-dependent photographs (e.g., photos of buildings, landmarks, etc.), which use GPS positions for geo-tagging. The P2P mobile agent framework supports intelligent agents. This agent searches similar content image using a query photograph by traversing the P2P network, instead of the mobile device issuing the query. In this paper, we describe the design of the proposed system and a portion of its implementation. This prototype system produces a new peer and rearranges the placement of image agents among peers for workload balancing. Furthermore, we provide the experimental results of our implementation for managing location-dependent image agents, which are clustered with peers in a distributed Delaunay network.},

abstract={As the mobile computing environment emerges, people can use different mobile devices to access information ubiquitously. This has shifted the researchers' sights to Mobile P2P (MP2P) systems, where the membership among peers is more dynamic and ad hoc. In the ubiquitous environments, the mobile devices generally are heterogeneous. In this paper, we consider the MP2P systems where the mobile peers are heterogeneous and propose a mechanism, named Heterogeneity-aware Overlay Technique (HOT), to build up an unstructured overlay. The proposed mechanism considers the overall ability, including power, network, CPU, and memory to set up the overlay. An ability equation is thus defined and the resulting overlay can ensure a good quality of service while the topology mismatching problem is alleviated. Last, we present our simulation for the proposed mechanism and compare the results with other related approaches. The simulation result shows that our proposed mechanism can effectively achieve a better service quality and mitigate the topology mismatching problem.},

abstract={Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are a form of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) in which vehicles on the road form the nodes of the network. VANETs provide several services to enhance the safety and comfort drivers and passengers. One of the services that VANETs can provide is file sharing between vehicles. Sharing large scale files through the network is a challenging task. Therefore, developing an efficient peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing scheme is important. This paper presents a P2P file sharing scheme for VANETs using TC-MAC, a MAC algorithm for vehicular ad-hoc networks using Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) slot reservation based on clustering of vehicles. Using TDMA will reduce collisions and packet drops in the channel, as well as provide fairness in sharing the wireless medium and minimizing the effect of hidden terminals. Our work aims to develop a P2P file sharing algorithm to improve the file downloading time between neighbouring vehicles.},

abstract={In a single-server mobile network, authorized users can dynamically login to the server for requiring internet services or resources. A password authenticated key exchange protocol can be used to authenticate user's legitimacy and establish a secure communication between a user and his logon server by using his friendly memorized password. In generally, users can dynamically access internet resources and services from multiple servers via mobile networks. However, it is difficult for users and servers to easily and securely manage passwords and secret keys in multi-server mobile networks. This paper proposes a password authenticated key exchange protocol for multi-server mobile networks based on Chebyshev chaotic map. Properties of the proposed protocol are given below. (i) The user can easily memorize a single password to login different servers without the assistance of a trusted registration authority. (ii) The user can share distinct secret information with different servers, and hence a malicious server cannot use it to masquerade as the user to login the other server(s). (iii) It is secure against some potential attacks. (iv) An authenticated key shared between the user and the server can be established for securing their communications. (v) It can provide key confirmation for the shared session key. (vi) It can provide higher security assurance in generating secret keys.},

abstract={Sensors of diverse capabilities and modalities, carried by us or deeply embedded in the physical world, have invaded our personal, social, work, and urban spaces. A big enabler have been mobile phones that we always carry and which have diverse sensors embedded in them or wirelessly connected to them. Our relationship with these sensors is a complicated one. On the one hand, these sensors collect rich data that are shared and disseminated, often initiated by us, with a broad array of service providers, interest groups, friends, and family. Embedded in this data is information that can be used to algorithmically construct a virtual biography of our activities, revealing intimate behaviors and lifestyle patterns. On the other hand, we increasingly depend directly and indirectly on information originating from these sensors for making a variety of decisions, both routine and critical, in our lives. The quality of these decisions and our confidence in them depend directly on the quality of the sensory information and our trust in the sources. Drawing upon examples of this two-faceted relationship with sensors from our work in applications such as mobile health and sustainable buildings, this talk will discuss the challenges inherent in designing a sensor information flow and processing architecture that is sensitive to the concerns of both producers and consumers. For the pervasive sensing infrastructure to be trusted by both, it must support a privacy-utility trade-off that balances the tension between risk of information sharing to the producer and the value of information sharing to the consumer. The talk will describe an approach to enabling this tradeoff based on interpreting privacy and utility in terms of inferences that are allowed or prohibited, and supported by mechanisms for controlled transformation of the quality of information via selective obfuscation driven by statistical models of individual behaviors, and robust fusion of information of uncertain qual- ty and obfuscation from sensors of varied trustworthiness. The design of a contextaware privacy-preserving sensing stack for Android-based mobile phones will also be presented.},

abstract={UPnP is a networking protocol that allows devices embracing personal computers, smartphones and tablet computers to discover other devices and control their services. Using portable smart devices, the UPnP services needed by these devices often vary. According to the locations or the situations of users, the required roles of the devices that support users' activities change and the services needed for achieving the roles also vary. However, it is difficult to dynamically add or update UPnP services and change the roles of the devices. We propose a new dynamic update method of UPnP services in this paper. `Service-updater service', one of UPnP services, is utilized in this method, which can update other UPnP services of its own device. Users do not have to install many services manually in advance. In addition, applying our method, it is also possible for smart devices to change their roles; according to users' situations, the devices can be turned into UPnP controllers, which control UPnP services of other devices. We have developed a prototype to which this method is applied and we have confirmed through the experiment that this technique effectively supports users' activities.},

abstract={Context-awareness is one of the main aspects of pervasive computing environments. Recently, some social networking systems have also started to exploit context information. These two paradigms serve different purposes. Pervasive computing systems have been designed mainly to address the needs of individual users, thus neglecting the social nature of humans. On the other hand, social computing focuses on exploiting the social relations between users, on promoting their interactions and on supporting the sharing of digital resources among them. However, the recent development and popularity of social networking systems has happened in isolation from the developments in pervasive computing. This paper elaborates on the role of context in both pervasive and social computing environments and introduces the approach of the SOCIETIES project that integrates full scale pervasive functionality in social networking systems to develop the next generation of social media systems. Finally, it discusses the new research challenges that emerge in pervasive social media regarding community context-awareness and the respective benefits that the end users may experience.},

To provide their intended service or application, these devices will collect unprecedented levels of data about users as they go about their daily lives. Users are anticipated to seamlessly, and frequently, physically move between numerous monitoring systems on a regular basis. As a result, it may become difficult for users to comprehend and keep track of the systems that monitor them, how their data is used, and to give informed consent. One solution is to use smart phones to selectively notify users to changes in the monitoring systems around them.

abstract={Pedestrian navigation in indoor environments without a pre-installed infrastructure still presents many challenges. There are different approaches that address the problem using prior knowledge about the environment when the building plans or similar are available. Since this is not always the case, a family of technologies based on the principle of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been proposed. In this paper we will present some estimates on how a mapping process based on FootSLAM - a form of SLAM for pedestrians - might scale for a large-scale collaborative effort eventually encompassing most of our public indoor space, where the mapping entities are humans. Our assumptions on pedestrian motion and area visiting rate together with calculations based on the computational requirements of pedestrian SLAM algorithms allow us to make estimates with regard to the feasibility, scalability and computational cost of wide-scale mapping of indoor areas by pedestrians.},

abstract={In this work we present a mobile stress recognition system based on an existing activity recognition system using a hip-worn inertial measurement unit and a chest belt. Integrating activity knowledge, the prediction of different human stress levels in a mobile environment can be enabled while the state of the art is focussed on stress recognition in static environments. Our system has been implemented on an Android mobile phone and evaluated for different Bayesian networks as classifiers. Our implementation is able to operate in real-time with a stress inference rate of 1 Hz. The results of this work indicate that the implemented system is able to differentiate between the states 'No Stress' and 'Stress' in a mobile context. A more detailed distinction of stress in five substates has not been possible in a reliable way to date. With our results, the proposed system can serve as a basis for further improvements with larger data sets and for in-situ testing during disaster assessment.},

pages={133-138}, 
abstract={With the push for smart environments and the advent of concepts like Systems of Systems and Internet of Things, the need for underlying large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) infrastructures is evident, however it is likely that no single private user could justify the costs to be incurred for a large-scale WSN deployment and the subsequent management and maintenance costs. In order to drive down costs and maximize the WSN utility a shared infrastructure approach makes large-scale multipurpose WSNs viable. The shared infrastructure paradigm where multiple applications and end users act on a single physical WSN infrastructure in parallel requires a fundamental change in the way WSN resources are managed are, specifically at the WSN device level. This paper draws on the cloud computing infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model and presents Serviceware - a middleware approach for infrastructure virtualization in next generation WSNs, where the WSN resources are exposed as services. Virtualization enables the slicing of the physical infrastructure into unique segments or virtual sensor networks that can be configured for individual end users according to their specific requirements.},

"Question First" helps elderly users to transfer their knowledge or experiences by simply answering questions through conventional mobile terminals. The proposed interaction model is based on extending conventional interaction modes of phone calls and em ails, helping elderly users become fam iliar with social networking, without the requirement of learning to use social networking service interfaces. Ultimately, we aim to expand the social participation of the elderly in both online communication and online work such as crowdsourcing. We report the results of a two-week user study on the crowdsourcing of participants' experience and knowledge through online communication, and analyze the information obtained to evaluate the efficiency of this interaction model by extracting features of each participant's knowledge and experience via the proposed method.},

Aiming to provide an infrastructure for the development of this kind of applications, we propose Content Sharing for Smart Spaces (C3S), a middleware that offers a high-level programming model using primitives that are based on a set of content sharing semantics.

abstract={In pervasive computing scenarios, user sessions often involve multiple devices like smartphones, tablets, large public displays and smart objects. In such settings, session mobility allows users to split sessions across several devices, to dynamically include or remove devices from sessions and to handover sessions from one device to another. While there are some good SIP-based solutions for session mobility in ubiquitous audio/video scenarios, there is yet no working approach for collaborative apps with event-like communication patterns. We describe and evaluate a solution for session mobility based on XMPP offering discovery of personal devices, discovery and authorization of public devices, and adhoc discovery of smart objects. All this can be done with little or no modification of existing XMPP technology, thus creating a standard-based toolset for session mobility. This eases development of collaborative apps and finally allows users to seamlessly continue their task in pervasive settings.},

abstract={Micro-Volunteering is the phenomenon of volunteering one's time and energy for extremely short periods of time. It is often considered a subset of Virtual Volunteering where one can volunteer one's time and energy via the Internet. There are many successful examples of Virtual Volunteering such as the Gutenberg project and the Librivox project. However, in both these cases, a volunteer must donate a substantial amount of his or her time in activities such as reading books or proofreading books. This paper examines the concept of synchronous micro-volunteering where potential volunteers can effectively donate as little as 10 minutes of their time and immediately assist other people. The paper then describes the architecture which supports synchronous micro-volunteering.},

year={2013}, 
volume={},

pages={181-186}, 
abstract={The globalization of TV programming (especially in the Sports and Reality segments) is leading to a bewildering amount of choice for TV watchers. The social currency around knowing what's happening in these programs as they happen combined with notable undulations in the interestingness of these programs leads to a navigation problem for the TV watcher. The pervasive use of Twitter in conjunction with TV watching makes it a potential sensor for real-time TV, and therefore a building block in solving the user problem of interstitially navigating to the most interesting program at any point in time. Given that users have to tune into shows with peak moments as soon as those peak moments happen, interstitial navigation has to be high enough performance to enable TV event detection and user tune in within tens of seconds of the event. The question being addressed in this paper is - Do Twitter's social sensing capabilities have sufficient precision and timeliness to cater to the `extreme' navigation needs of sports fans? And if so - how can we design a TV event detection framework that can be extended to multiple sports, and beyond sports. We focus on navigation for sports programming in the narrative, as an extremely demanding TV application that also has high market attractiveness. However, we anticipate that the ideas and architecture proposed herein apply to any TV programming that lends itself to interstitial viewing, and elicits a high level of real-time user participation in social networks.},

Next, we organize topic hierarchical structures from each co-occurrence network by using the modularity. Then, we explore a community mapping as an LCA-preserving mapping between topic hierarchical structures and a topic mapping as a correspondence in a community mapping.

abstract={Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing have fundamentally changed the way people interact and communicate with each other. As the command-center of the user's communications with the outside world, smartphones hold the key to understand the user's social relationship with other people of interest. In this paper, we propose to use the unique multi-model interaction data from smartphone to classify social relationships. We firstly carry out a social interaction data collection campaign with a group of smartphone users to obtain real-life multi-modal communication data and model the data as a social interaction matrix. Then we perform a statistical analysis on the social interaction matrix to identify the interesting interaction patterns in the data. After applying different classification algorithms on social interaction matrix, we find that SVM outperforms KNN and decision tree algorithms, with a classification accuracy of 82.4% (the accuracies of KNN and decision tree are 79.9% and 77.6% respectively). Additionally, with dimensionality reduction algorithms, we embed the social interaction data containing 65 features into a 9-dimensional space while preserving the high classification accuracy. We also demonstrate the viability of applying CUR decomposition to identify important features so as to conserve energy during interaction data collection. In particular, based on the 13 out of 65 features selected by the CUR approach, we can still achieve classification accuracy of 77.7% while substantially cut down the amount of raw interaction data to be collected, stored and processed.},

In this work we present Matador, a framework to embed context-awareness in the presentation and execution of crowd-sensing tasks. This allows to present the right tasks, to the right users in the right circumstances, and to preserve normal device functioning. We present the design and prototype implementation of the platform, including an energy-efficient context sampling algorithm.

abstract={People mobility enormously augmented in the last decades. However, despite the increased possibilities of fast reaching far places, the places that a person commonly visits remain limited in number. The number of visited places of each person is regulated by some laws that are statistically similar among individuals. In our previous work, we firstly argued that a person visit most frequently always few places, and we confirmed that by some initial experiments. Here, in addition to further validating this result, we build a more sophisticate view of the places visited by the people. Namely, on top of our previous work, which identifies the class of Mostly Visited Points of Interest, we define two next classes: the Occasionally and the Exceptionally Visited Points of Interest classes. We argue and validate on real data, that also the occasional places are very limited in number, while the exceptional ones can grow at will, and by the analysis of the classes of visited points we can distinguish the type of users mobility. This paper firstly demonstrates this property in large experimental scenario, and put the basis for new understanding of people places in several areas as localization, social interactions and human mobility modelling.},

In our method the resulting lists can be built according to different criteria aiming to highlight differences and similarities among locations that can be in geographical proximity, belong to a similar type/category, or be included in the personal mobility history of a specific user.},

AmbientSense continuously recognizes user context by analyzing ambient sounds sampled from a smartphone's microphone. The phone provides a user with realtime feedback on recognised context. AmbientSense is implemented as an Android app and works in two modes: in autonomous mode processing is performed on the smartphone only. In server mode recognition is done by transmitting audio features to a server and receiving classification results back. We evaluated both modes in a set of 23 daily life ambient sound classes and describe recognition performance, phone CPU load, and recognition delay. The application runs with a fully charged battery up to 13.75 h on a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone and up to 12.87 h on a Google Nexus One phone.

abstract={The proliferation of smartphones as complex sensing systems represents today the basis to further stimulate the active participation of mobile users in opportunistic sensing services. However, single sensing devices (either independent network components or integrated in more powerful devices) generally present different capabilities and implement proprietary standards. This highlights the necessity of defining a common standard for sensing data encoding in order to guarantee the interoperability of heterogeneous devices and personal mobile systems. In this paper we present Sensor Mobile Enablement (SME), a lightweight standard for efficiently identifying, coding and decoding heterogeneous sensing information on mobile devices. After a detailed analysis of SME features and advantages, we present its performances derived from real experiments on Android smartphones. Results highlight that SME does not heavily impact on mobile system's performances while efficiently supporting opportunistic sensing services.},

abstract={Acquisition of data to capture human mobility and interactions during large-scale events is a challenging task. In this paper we discuss a mobile sensing method for mapping the mobility of crowds at large scale events using a participatory Bluetooth sensing approach. This non-invasive technique for collecting spatio-temporal data about participant mobility and social interactions uses the capabilities of Bluetooth capable smartphones carried by participants. As a proof-of-concept we present a field study with deployment of the method in a large music festival with 130000 participants where a small subset of participants installed Bluetooth sensing apps on their personal smartphones. Our software module uses location and Bluetooth scans to utilize smartphones as provisional scanners that are present with higher frequency in regions with high density of participants. We discuss the initial results obtained and outline opportunities and challenges introduced by this methodology along with opportunities for future pervasive systems and applications.},

While this paves the way to the opportunity of having detailed and geo-referenced measures, the design of the systems has to take into account additional difficulties such as scalability, coordination and smartphones' reachability.

volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={255-260}, 
abstract={Wireless mesh networks are well-recognised by their self-organising properties. End-to-end routing protocols are primarily responsible for achieving these advanced features. However, wireless link failures can cause a route to be invalidated and subsequently removed from the routing table in nodes along the path to destination. Once the route is not available, packets addressed for that destination will be dropped. To improve the packet delivery ratio of those end-to-end protocols, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates features of opportunistic protocols into traditional end-to-end routing protocols in mesh networks. The idea is to buffer packets for which there is no path to the destination and attempt to deliver these buffered packets when an alternative route is found or to pass them to neighbours who might eventually be able to establish a route to the destination. To demonstrate the concept, we present the AODV-OPP - an extension of the AODV protocol that uses opportunistic communication. AODVOPP always prefers end-to-end route before attempting to send opportunistically to neighbours. Based on a number of systematic simulation scenarios, we observe that AODV-OPP consistently outperforms the original AODV, with a PDR gain greater than 8% most times and up to 45%.},

abstract={Mobile devices and wearable sensors are making available records of human mobility and proximity with unprecedented levels of detail. Here we focus on close-range human proximity networks measured by means of wireless wearable sensors in a variety of real-world environments. We show that simple dynamical processes computed over the time-varying proximity networks can uncover important features of the interaction patterns that go beyond standard statistical indicators of heterogeneity and burstiness, and can tell apart datasets that would otherwise look statistically similar. We show that, due to the intrinsic temporal heterogeneity of human dynamics, the characterization of spreading processes over time-varying networks of human contact may benefit from abandoning the notion of wall-clock time in favor of a node-specific notion of time based on the contact activity of individual nodes.},

abstract={Continuous personal position information has been attracting attention in a variety of service and research areas. In recent years, many studies have applied the telecommunication histories of mobile phones (CDRs: call detail records) to position acquisition. Although large-scale and long-term data are accumulated from CDRs through everyday use of mobile phones, the spatial resolution of CDRs is lower than that of existing positioning technologies. Therefore, interpolating spatiotemporal positions of such sparse CDRs in accordance with human behavior models will facilitate services and researches. In this paper, we propose a new method to compensate for CDR drawbacks in tracking positions. We generate as many candidate routes as possible in the spatiotemporal domain using trip patterns interpolated using road and railway networks and select the most likely route from them. Trip patterns are feasible combinations between stay places that are detected from individual location histories in CDRs. The most likely route could be estimated through comparing candidate routes to observed CDRs during a target day. We also show the assessment of our method using CDRs and GPS logs obtained in the experimental survey.},

year={2013},

pages={273-278}, 
abstract={A growing source of concern is that the privacy of individuals can be violated by linking information from multiple sources. For example, the linking of a person's anonymized information with other information about that person can lead to de-anonymization of the person. To investigate the social risks of such linking, we investigated the use of social networks for background checking, which is the process of evaluating the qualifications of job seekers, and evaluated the risk posed by the linking of information the employer already has with information on social networks. After clarifying the risk, we developed a system that links information from different sources: information extracted from a job seeker's résumé and anonymous posts on social networks. The system automatically calculates the similarity between information in the résumé and in the posts, and identifies the job seeker's social network accounts even though the profiles may have been anonymized. As a part of our system, we developed a novel method for quantifying the implications of terms in a résumé by using the posts on social networks. In an evaluation using the résumés of two job seekers and the tweets of 100 users, the system identified the accounts of both job seekers with reasonably good accuracy (true positive rate of 0.941 and true negative rate of 0.999). These findings reveal the real social threat of linking information from different sources. Our research should thus form the basis for further study of the relationship between privacy in social networks and the freedom to express opinions.},

abstract={As smart phones with a GPS receiver have been becoming popular recently, many people have realized the issue of protecting their location privacy. Previous research on location privacy mainly focuses on anonymization techniques for removing identifiable information from users' location traces. Although anonymized location data is useful to many applications, such as traffic monitoring, we can provide a new class of location-based services by utilizing path information of mobile users. In this paper, we present a dynamic pseudonym scheme for constructing alternate possible paths of mobile users to protect their location privacy. We introduce a formal definition of location privacy for pseudonym-based location data sets and show an efficient verification algorithm for determining whether each user in a given location data set has sufficient number of possible paths to disguise the user's true movements.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a lane-level dynamic traffic control (LDTC) system targeting at driving efficiency optimization. The LDTC system integrates vehicular networks with intersection cameras to collect fine-grained information of vehicles, such as turning intentions and lane positions. LDTC can maximize the intersection throughput and provide fairness among traffic flows. With vehicular networks, the traffic controller of an intersection can collect all turning information before vehicles make their turns. With intersection cameras, the lane positions of vehicles can be detected even if GPS is not accurate enough to provide lane localization. In addition, the traffic condition can be continually monitored as some vehicles are not equipped with onboard units for vehicular communications. In LDTC, while allocating the green light to the traffic flows with higher passing rates for throughput maximization, it also allocates the green light to the ones with lower passing rates for fairness provision. This paper demonstrates our current prototype.},

The two sensing platforms are typically isolated from each other. In this paper, we build ExposureSense, a rich mobile participatory sensing infrastructure that integrates the two independent sensing paradigms.

PIKE minimizes the configuration effort that is necessary to set up a secure communication channel among a set of devices. To do this, it piggybacks the exchange of cryptographic keys on existing online services which perform user authentication and enable the (secure) sharing of resources. To support encryption or authentication without Internet connection, PIKE relies on the automatic detection of triggers for upcoming personal interactions and exchanges keys before they take place. To demonstrate the broad applicability of PIKE, we present two example applications that show how its secure key exchange can be used in the real world. The first application uses PIKE to automatically share resources - in our case the readings of a GPS receiver - among a set of devices, when an event takes place. The second application relies on PIKE to enable the secure and automatic identification of individual visitors at the registration desk of a conference.},

In this demonstration we describe the results of our research into the automated and intelligent configuration and composition of services for complex tasks. We present a service-oriented system capable of performing service configuration under spatial and relevancy constraints. It can configure services in one of the three following modes: distributed, centralized and hybrid. It also supports automatic reconfiguration in the event of service failures. This system uses a generic cost representation for services that may include spatial coverage of the services in an area of interest along with other service configuration cost metrics. We demonstrate our system using state-of-the-art emulation frameworks with a real life scenario.},

abstract={Knowledge of the 3D geometry of large urban buildings and surrounding structures is important in indoor navigation applications, emergencies, and evacuation response. Visual representations of the 3D geometry can be useful to users navigating unfamiliar buildings. The traditional methods of constructing 3D models from CAD drawings or GIS systems are prone to error, difficult to modify in a timely manner, can easily become out-of-date, and are not scalable. We exploit the power of current mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) and their 3D graphics rendering capabilities to present a mobile application that uses crowdsourcing to build 3D models of large buildings and urban structures. Our system is based on a client-server architecture, where users of a mobile application create, submit, and vote on 3D models of building components; the server collects and uses votes pertaining to accuracy and completion of a model to determine if an object may be approved. We describe preliminary results from using the system on a floor of an academic building and propose its deployment and demonstration during Percom 2013 for mapping the conference venue by meeting participants.},

abstract={Imagine if your favorite social networking website provided a "Share to Screen" button that automatically dimmed the room lights and streamed your web-based photos and videos to a nearby television, projector or photo frame. Unfortunately, such fluid interactions between the Web and the physical environment remain challenging, since conventional Web browsers are still unable to directly interact with the broad range of context sources and physical actuators available in highly heterogeneous mobile environments. In our previous work, we presented our plug-and-play context framework, called Ambient Dynamix (Dynamix), which enables advanced context sensing and acting capabilities to be deployed on-demand to mobile devices as plug-ins; enabling entirely new interaction techniques for the Web. To illustrate some of these possibilities, we demonstrate a fully functional Web application that leverages Dynamix plug-ins to stream shared photos and videos from a popular online social network to nearby media rendering devices discovered in the user's physical environment. For a better viewing experience, the demo also adjusts the room's ambient light dimmers through ad-hoc discovery and control of home automation equipment. The demo highlights how Dynamix enables Web applications to discover rich, high-order contextual information, perform context-aware adaptations, and directly influence the physical environment - all from within unmodified mobile Web browsers, such as Google Chrome and Firefox.},

abstract={Increasingly manufacturers of smartphone devices are utilising a diverse range of sensors. This innovation has enabled developers to accurately determine a user's current context. In recent years there has also been a renewed requirement to use more types of context and reduce the current over-reliance on location as a context. Location based systems have enjoyed great success and this context is very important for mobile devices. However, using additional context data such as weather, time, social media sentiment and user preferences can provide a more accurate model of the user's current context. One area that has been significantly improved by the increased use of context in mobile applications is tourism. Traditionally tour guide applications rely heavily on location and essentially ignore other types of context. This has led to problems of inappropriate suggestions, due to inadequate content filtering and tourists experiencing information overload. These problems can be mitigated if appropriate personalisation and content filtering is performed. The intelligent decision making that this paper proposes with regard to the development of the VISIT [17] system, is a hybrid based recommendation approach made up of collaborative filtering, content based recommendation and demographic profiling. Intelligent reasoning will then be performed as part of this hybrid system to determine the weight/importance of each different context type.},

Many challenges are raised, such as how to enhance memory recall and reminiscence, how to facilitate memory sharing in terms of people's social nature. This paper proposes MemPhone, a new system that addresses various human memory needs by using the mobile tagging (e.g., RFID, barcodes) technique. By linking human memory or experience with associated physical objects, MemPhone can i) augment memory externalization and recall, and ii) build object-based social networks (OBSNs) to enhance memory sharing. By embedding physical contexts into SNs, the OBSN can strengthen friendships by enabling serendipity discovering and nurture new connections among people with shared memories. Early studies indicate that our system can facilitate memory recall and shared memory discovery.},

year={2013}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={336-339}, 
abstract={A large fraction of indoor localization methods rely on anchor nodes that periodically transmit their coordinates using radio signals. Mobile nodes then use the received information to decode their own locations. For all these methods to work, the underlying assumption is that anchors should send their beacons at different times, i.e. the beacons should not collide. We propose a radically new approach for indoor localization: to overlap the transmissions of beacons (synchronized collisions). Our collision-based method leverages the capture effect, which states that when several radio signals collide, only the strongest (nearest) signal is detected. Compared to the state of the art, our simple change of perspective -from non-colliding to colliding beacons- provides two important advantages. First, the lifetime of the mobile nodes can be increased by three orders of magnitude (from days to years). Second, our method is more resilient to external interfering sources, such as WiFi stations. In this work-in-progress, we (i) provide a preliminary evaluation of our prototype, and (ii) describe the challenges that we are currently working on to produce a fully-fleshed commercial system. While indoor localization is a very active research area, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to evaluate a collision-based approach.},

abstract={Rapid increase in number of vehicles on the roads as well as growing size of cities have led to a plethora of challenges for road traffic management authorities such as traffic congestion, accidents and air pollution. The work presented in this paper focuses on the particular problem of traffic management for emergency services, for which a delay of few minutes may cause human lives risks as well as financial losses. The goal is to reduce the latency of emergency services for vehicles such as ambulances and police cars, with minimum unnecessary disruption to the regular traffic, and preventing potential misuses. To this end, we propose to design a framework in which the Traffic Management System (TMS) may adapt by dynamically adjusting traffic lights, changing related driving policies, recommending behavior change to drivers, and applying essential security controls. The choice of an adaptation depends on the emergency severity level announced by the emergency vehicle(s). The severity level may need to be verified by corresponding authorities to preserve security measures. We discuss the details of our proposed framework and the potential challenges in the paper.},

pages={348-351}, 
abstract={ZigBee has been used more and more extensively in various applications such as wireless patient monitoring, herds monitoring, smart control in home networking and game remote controllers, etc. Most of these applications are performance-sensitive so the throughput and packet delivery ratio should be guaranteed for ZigBee system to work properly. However, since both WiFi and ZigBee are operated in unlicensed ISM spectrum, the interferences from WiFi hotspots make the coexistence of ZigBee and WiFi a big challenge. WiFi traffic contains quite a lot of white spaces between frame clusters in the time domain which could be taken advantage of to improve the performance of the systems with the coexistence of ZigBee and WiFi. Most existing mechanisms dealing with the coexistence of heterogeneous wireless systems neglects this important fact. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that ensures high performance of ZigBee in spite of the presence of strong interference from WiFi, and at the same time keep the WiFi performance almost unaffected. Our approach is to learn a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on traces of WiFi white-spaces in the current network. With such a HMM model we can accurately characterize the dynamic distribution of the durations of white spaces in different times. Based on the HMM model of white spaces and the analysis of system performance we develop a novel ZigBee frame control protocol called HMM-driven Smart White-space-aware Frame Control Protocol which can allow ZigBee networks to coexist with WiFi networks with desired link throughput and packet delivery ratio. Some initial experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our protocol.},

Most of the existing solutions preserve location privacy relying on a trusted anonymizer, which may not exist in real situation. Several peer-to-peer approaches are proposed, but these techniques require large-scale data storage and communication, and they cannot provide up-to-date context information to users. To address this issue, we propose a novel method JointCache to preserve location privacy by confusing nearby users' paths. Using this technique, users do not need to buffer context information of a large area and they only need to transfer little information to each other for cooperation. We use simulation to compare JointCache with the traditional path confusion, the results show that our technique solves the same place same time problem, and achieves higher anonymity even in a low user density situation.},

abstract={The combination and integration of sensing and interaction capabilities with almost ubiquitous inter-connectivity are basic requirements for context-aware systems to unobtrusively and invisibly support users in their daily activities. However, the invisible nature of such systems also threatens users' privacy. Users often lack awareness about a system's capabilities to gather data or to intervene in user activities, or even the system's presence. We propose a model to enhance user-centric privacy awareness by consistently modeling observations and disturbances of users. The model allows to capture who is affecting a user's privacy, how privacy is affected, and why it is affected. We further discuss how this model can be instantiated with discovery of channel policies.},

Moreover, we propose a method for constructing power consumption models of devices based on measurements of actual power consumption of real devices and a method for constructing comfort level functions of users based on the questionnaires. Through simulations, we confirmed that the proposed method achieves the target energy saving ratio with small comfort level reduction.},

abstract={Opportunistic networks (ONs) exploit mobility of wireless devices to route messages and distribute content independent of fixed network infrastructure. An inherent property of ONs is that the unpredictable mobility of devices results in brief and intermittent connections between networked nodes. This presents a challenge to implementing useful distributed system paradigms, such as distributed transactions. Transactions are a sequence of read and write operations that must be executed in a reliable and coherent fashion, even in the presence of multiple concurrent operations or process failures. Distributed transactions require the participation of multiple processes utilizing data available locally to collaborate with other processes. In this work in progress paper, we outline the requirements behind a novel cache-based mechanism for distributed transactions in ONs.

abstract={Two important aspects for efficient and safe firefighting operations are team communication behavior and physical activity coordination. In close cooperation with a firefighting brigade we investigate the potential of modern smartphones to acquire objective data on team communication and physical activity in an automatic way. We envision that such a monitoring is helpful for improving post incident feedback to enhance the efficiency and safety of firefighting operations. In this contribution we present our findings of a feasibility study in which two firefighting teams had to extinguish a kitchen fire. We present the obtained measures of speech and physical activity levels and show how the difference in performance between the two teams can be explained by the smartphone measures.},

abstract={Following the vision of an Internet of Things (IoT) real world objects are integrated into the Internet to provide data as sensors and to manipulate the real world as actors. While current IoT approaches focus on the integration of things based on service technologies, scenarios in domains like smart cities, automotive or crisis management require service platforms involving real world objects, backend-systems and mobile devices. In this paper we introduce a service platform based on the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for the development and provision of services for such pervasive infrastructures. We argue for XMPP as protocol for unified, real-time communication and introduce the major concepts of our platform. Based on two case studies we demonstrate real-time capabilities of XMPP for remote robot control and service development in the e-mobility domain.},

abstract={With the growing number of cities and population, continuous monitoring of city's infrastructure and automated collection of day-to-day events (such as traffic jam) is essential and can help in improving life style of citizens. It is extremely costly and ineffective to install hardware sensors to sense these events in developing regions. Due to advent of smartphones, citizens can play role of sensors and actively participate in collection of the events which can be shared with others for information or can be used in decisions which affects city development. In this paper, we describe an architecture of crowdsensing testbed for capturing and processing events affecting citizens in cities in India. One of the design principle of our testbed is that it encourages users to do an open-ended sensing under five broad categories: Civic complaints, traffic, neighbourhood issues, emergency and others. As part of testbed, we allow events submissions from different submission modes i.e. mobile application, SMSes and web. Our mobile application exploits different sensing interfaces provided by today's smartphones to add contextual data with event reports such as images, audio, fine-grained location etc. Proposed testbed is used by university students across India to report event happening around them. Finally, we describe the data collected and uncover some of challenges and opportunities which may help future designs of crowdsensing based systems.},

abstract={Today's digital signage systems typically show content that has been scheduled well in advance by their respective “owners”, i.e., companies or individuals who paid for and/or operate the public display. However, with the shift to open display networks that can obtain content from many sources and the corresponding advances in interaction and sensing technologies, the scheduling requirements in this domain are set to change radically. For example, we envision that displays in our environment will soon be able to adapt to their surroundings and allow viewers to appropriate them by actively selecting and/or contributing content. Such levels of interactivity and context-awareness will require new approaches to content scheduling. In this paper we discuss the challenges faced in developing new forms of application and content scheduling for Open Pervasive Display Networks.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose and investigate a user-centric device-cloud architecture for intelligently managing user data. The architecture allows users to keep their (private) data on their mobile devices and decide what to share with the service providers on the cloud, based on their individual privacy preferences, in order to get personalized services. Our architecture strives to help ease users' burden on managing privacy by giving automatic recommendations on how to configure their privacy profiles on devices. One focused contribution of this paper is that we instantiate this proposed general architecture to location-based service due to the privacy sensitivity of location data. We derive and validate our location-sharing recommendations using online user experiments. Our results show that the recommendations are accurate, and that they help users with the decisions involved in the privacy profile configuration process. Our results also demonstrate that the quality of personalized location-based services can be maintained even when the increased user privacy control leads to a situation where not all location data is shared with the service provider. These results lead the way to powerful location-based and other personalized services that improve user privacy.},

Moreover, we exploit displays and cameras as virtual networks to transfer data using 2D barcode slideshows.

Thus we imagine a user with his on body activity recognition system passing through a space with a video camera (or a Kinect), picking up some information, and using it to improve his system. The general idea is to correlate an anonymous ”stick figure” like description of the motion of a user's body parts provided by the vision system with the sensor signals as a means of analyzing the sensors' properties.

abstract={With advances in information and communication technologies, vehicles on roads can cooperatively share and retrieve information in a distributed manner to support Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) services such as traffic management and infotainment services. A system is needed to retrieve information and data from moving vehicles and roadside facilities in an efficient manner. However, existing distributed vehicular systems rely on either vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) or application-layer peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols over an infrastructure-based wireless network suffering from low success rate or long latency in information retrieval. In this work, we propose a two-tier VANET/P2P system that integrates low-tier VANETs and a high-tier infrastructure-based P2P overlay. The proposed two-tier system aims to achieve high success rate, reduce latency, and minimize overhead for information retrieval in vehicular environments.},

abstract={Ubiquitous deployment of cameras and recent advances in video analytics enable a new class of applications, situation awareness using camera networks. The application class includes surveillance, traffic monitoring, and assisted living that autonomously generate actionable knowledge from a large number of camera streams. Despite technological advances, developing a large-scale situation awareness application still remains a challenge due to the programming complexity, highly dynamic workloads, and latency-sensitive quality of service. To solve the problem, my research topic concerns developing a programming model and a runtime system to support large-scale situation awareness applications on camera networks. The programming model requires a minimal set of domain-specific handlers from the domain experts, allowing them to focus on the algorithmic aspect of situation awareness applications rather than the details of distributed programming. The runtime system provides automatic resource management using smart cameras and the cloud for handling dynamic workloads and ensuring latency-sensitive quality of services.},

To this end, lighter, faster, more efficient and scalable distributed data processing algorithms are necessary. In particular, new mechanisms are necessary for adaptive and opportunistic sensing within a cluster of smartphones. Furthermore, a distributed data mining algorithm is in need of proposition to run on each smartphone for information retrieval. The retrieved information also needs a new algorithm to be fused and even enhanced by more powerful devices such as sensor nodes in the infrastructure to obtain higher accuracy and reliability. For experimental validation, the new algorithms will be implemented on smartphones to collect and detect abnormalities from measured environmental elements such as sounds, pressure, temperature, light, etc., under various public safety scenarios including ambient noise. Currently, I am working from the scratch on a new idea that using a few preferable sensors to trigger others' measurement for adaptive and opportunistic sensing.

abstract={The Quality of Information (QoI) can be evaluated through the effect that the information will have on a system which is of critical interest. Although QoI is often be discussed in the context of sensor networks, this paper addresses QoI in a new and important framework: the management of energy distribution. We consider a system that combines constant power generation by some conventional source, together with renewable energy being generated and stored. The consumer has some fixed contract with the conventional energy source and obtains any excess needed energy from storage. We show that imperfections in the interpretation or delivery of information about the consumer's instantaneous needs can lead to measurable deficiencies in energy provisioning. The results are derived using Energy Packet Networks which are a novel approach to modeling energy systems based on queueing theory.},

pages={458-463}, 
abstract={We give an overview of a theory of semantic communication proposed by Goldreich, Juba, and Sudan. The theory is intended to capture the obstacles that arise when a diverse population of independently designed devices must communicate with one another. The aim of the theory is to provide conceptual foundations for the design and evaluation of devices that are compatible with such a diverse population. Conclusions drawn from the theory (i) identify a kind of information-sensing that is inherently necessary for compatibility whenever the population is sufficiently diverse and (ii) identify tensions between the richness of diversity and the computational cost of coping with such diversity in a population. We will review how these considerations are reflected in the formulation and design of an example application, a self-patching packet network stack. In particular, this application will illustrate the utility of explicit consideration of various computational complexity measures in addressing both (i) and (ii). We will also review work aimed at identifying kinds of populations across which compatibility can be achieved efficiently.},

abstract={This paper discusses and evaluates the impact of visualization and interaction strategies for extracting quality information from data in complex networks such as microblogs. Two different approaches to interactive visual representations of data are discussed: an interactive node-link graph and a novel approach where content is separated into interactive lists based on data properties. To assess the two approaches in terms of information credibility, the TopicNets system is compared with “Fluo”, a novel system. An analysis scenario is performed through each system on a set of big data filtered from the Twitter message service. The exposure of content, trade-offs between algorithmic power and interaction complexity, methods for content filtering, and strategies for recommending new content are assessed for each system. Fluo is found to improve on TopicNets ability to efficiently find relevant content primarily by providing a more structured content view, however, TopicNets is more customizable and boasts features which are critical for an expert analyst. The paper concludes with general insights on interface design for information filtering systems to maximize perceived quality of information.},

abstract={Pervasive information consumers in open, loosely-coupled systems, such as in Internet of Things and crowd-sensing environment, will rely more and more often on streaming information from sensory sources with whom they have only ephemeral, transient relationships. In such settings, information uncertainties arise as the trustworthiness of the sources and their information become questionable. It is thus necessary to quantify the quality of inferences made with such information to aid more informed and effective decision making and action taking. One of the aspects of trust assessment systems is to provide for such quality metrics, however, these systems have been traditionally applied in static situations. In this paper, we introduce TAF, a trust assessment framework for streaming information that leverages the rich toolkit of subjective logic operators to estimate the quality of said inferences under information uncertainty. We present the system architecture, describe its components and provide some preliminary quality results for the framework.},

abstract={In distributed network environments, decisions must often be made based on incomplete or uncertain evidence whose sources may be dependent. Properly fusing potentially unreliable and dependent information from multiple sources is critical to effective decision making. The Transferable Belief Model (TBM), an extension of Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST), is a well known information fusion framework that can cope with conflicting evidences. However, neither DST nor TBM deals with misbehaving data sources and dependence of fusion data, which are often observed in dynamic multi-hop network environments. In this work, we propose a decision fusion framework that considers multi-dimensional trust and independence of information using a provenance technique, to enhance fusion reliability. We consider three information trust dimensions: correctness, completeness, and timeliness. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework yields a higher correct decision ratio, compared with the baseline counterparts.},

pages={487-492}, 
abstract={The process of inversion, estimation and reconstruction of the sensor quality matrix, allows modeling the precision and accuracy, and in general the reliability of the model. When the sensor data ranges are not known a priori, current systems do not train on new data samples, rather they approximate based on the parameter's global average value, losing most of the spatial and temporal features. The proposed model, which we call SPOTLESS, checks the spatial integrity and temporal plausibility of streams generated by mobility patterns due to varying channel conditions. We define a minimum quality of the measured sensor data as local stream (QoD) requirements to give high precision by using distributed labeled training. In our SPOTLESS datacleaning steps, to account for packet errors due to varying channel conditions, a soft-phy based decoding is selected for various Bit Error Rates (BER), minimizing packet loss at the mobile receiver. Numerical experiments for Rayleigh fading channels and mobile BER model examples are compared with large deployment of ground sensor collecting static data streams and Data MULE collecting multi-hop temporal data from the sensor to provide hypothetical parameter accuracy. Our results were obtained in the context of provisioning a minimum precision and accuracy stream (QoD) required for 802.15.4 mobile services. SPOTLESS data-cleaning algorithm coding provides 90% precision for static streams, and increases the plausible relevance of multi-hop mobile streams by 85% for task-based learning.},

abstract={With the advent of wireless sensors and pervasive environments, autonomic human activity recognition has received substantial attention in research. In such environments, many sensors are deployed on each object with the purpose to collect sufficient data to recognize the activities of the object. To perform activity recognition, low-level data streams from the sensors are combined at the sink. A key challenge is to recognize efficiently and with high accuracy the object's activities based on the low-level sensor data. However, there is a trade-off between high accuracy and efficiency, caused by the cost of delivering data samples from sensors to the sink. The challenge is to determine sampling rates that satisfy the required accuracy and minimizes the communication cost. We formalize this problem of choosing sampling rates that satisfy the required accuracy and minimize the communication cost. We formalize this problem as an integer programming problem and solve it by using Lagrangian relaxation with branch-and-bound method. Evaluation results with a publicly available dataset demonstrate the potential applicability of our approach.},

abstract={Spatio-temporal attributes represent two aspects of physical presence - space and time - which are integral to human activities. Space-time markers of an entity in conjunction with correlation with other networks such as movements in social network, the road/transportation network encodes a wealth of provenance information. With the advent of mobile computing and cheap and improved location estimation techniques, encoding such information has become commonplace. In this paper, we will focus on deriving such location provenance information from unstructured text generated by social media. As social media such as Facebook and Twitter are integrated with mobile devices, information generated by individuals in these networks gets tagged with spatial markers. We can classify such markers into explicit and implicit tags, where explicit tags encode the spatial data explicitly by providing the accurate location attributes. On the other hand, a lot of social network data may not encode such information explicitly. Our hypothesis in this paper is that the unstructured textual data contains implicit spatial markers at a fine granularity. We develop algorithms to support this hypothesis and evaluate these algorithms on data from FourSquare to show that the spatial category information can be identified with an accuracy of over 80%.},

abstract={Emergency response operations are a promising application area for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). Most existing MANET routing protocols assume that an end-to-end path between source and destination can be established. However, this assumption may not hold in a hastily formed network established during an emergency response. This paper evaluates a store-and-forward mechanism for proactive routing protocols to mitigate the effects of network disruptions. The mechanism is integrated into two routing protocols. The modified protocols are evaluated in an emergency response scenario that includes a disaster area mobility model and a wireless obstacle model. The scenario represents a realistic first responder operation after an incident in a chemical facility. The evaluation results show that networks for disaster responses benefit from the modified routing protocols.},

The proposed algorithm computes the contraflow scheme by finding minimal number of shortest paths and hence its computation is highly efficient and scalable. In addition, the evacuation time for the computed contraflow scheme is better than or same as that of CCRP++ with the help of maximum (or at least higher) throughput flows. The computational results confirm the efficiency of the computation and the effectiveness of the computed contraflow schemes.},

We show that graph models can offer insight into the critical areas in an emergency evacuaton and that they can suggest locations where sensor systems are particularly important and may require hardening. On the other hand, we also show that analytical models based on queueing theory can provide useful estimates of evacuation times and for routing optimisation.

abstract={In urban emergencies and disasters, emergency support systems enabled by ubiquitous computing and mobile communications can prove very beneficial by providing alerts, guidance and other crucial information to civilians and emergency responders. However, the communication infrastructure that such systems depend upon is usually adversely affected in emergencies due to failures or congestion. Thus we consider the problem of providing emergency support when existing communication infrastructure is unavailable. We propose the use of opportunistic communications (Oppcomms) among mobile devices for the dissemination of emergency information. With Oppcomms, devices exchange messages at a close range of a few to tens of meters with limited or no infrastructure and messages are carried over multiple hops in a “store-carry-forward” manner by exploiting human mobility. We present an emergency support system (ESS) based on Oppcomms to provide evacuation guidance to civilians in large-scale urban emergencies in the absence of other means of communication. We evaluate the performance of ESS with simulation experiments of large-scale evacuation of a district of London, UK. Our evaluations show the improvement Oppcomms can offer.},

abstract={Energy has always been the number one issue in wireless sensor networks, both because of the resource constraints of sensor nodes and because of the need for untethered operation. In particular, the energy footprint of wireless communication has been the object of a great deal of interest over the past decade. Many applications of sensor networks require nodes to operate for months or even years without supervision, thus making it imperative for nodes to employ low-power radios and to duty-cycle them. To complicate matters further, low-power radios are notoriously exposed to the vagaries of RF propagation. The challenge of achieving energy-efficient and reasonably reliable communication over lossy links has shaped a large body of experimental research, mostly driven by the popular Berkeley motes. In this talk, I will illustrate the highlights of a decade of low-power wireless research, with an emphasis on the key accomplishments in medium access and routing.},

abstract={Security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is an omnipresent topic. In many application scenarios, like the surveillance of critical areas or infrastructures, security mechanisms have to be used to build reliable and secure applications. Up to now, most of the used cryptographic algorithms have been implemented in software despite the resource constraints in terms of processing power, memory and energy. In the past few years, the usage of special hardware accelerated security modules has been proposed as a viable alternative to software implementations. However, the energy-efficiency has not yet been evaluated in-depth. In this paper, we analyze the VaultIC420 security module and present an evaluation of its energy-efficiency. We compare the performance and energy-efficiency of the hardware module to common software implementations like TinyECC. For the energy measurements, we use IRIS sensor nodes in the SANDbed testbed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Our evaluation shows, that the VaultIC420 can save up to 76% of energy using different MAC layer protocols. It also shows, that the current draw of the VaultIC420 requires a duty-cycling mechanisms to achieve any savings compared to the software implementation.},

abstract={In future smart cities a grand challenge will be to sensorize large urban infrastructures at a feasible cost. In this paper we tackle the case of efficient leakage detection in water distribution systems. Deploying leakage detectors can cut operational costs for water utility providers. But, the cost for deploying them with sufficient granularity poses an high entrance barrier due to the scale of such infrastructures. We propose an algorithmic framework to efficiently deploy sensors in order to perform leakage/fault localization over large scale lattice-shaped networks. The novelty of our solution, combining covering sets and identifying codes is that it initially covers the network with low resolution, and thus fewer sensors. The set of sensors can then be extended in a way to progressively improve the resolution by which leakages are located. The proposed solution is validated through extensive numerical experiments.},

abstract={Energy is a scarce resource on battery-powered wireless sensor nodes, and wireless communication represents the major consumer of electric energy on most current platforms. Reducing the number and size of radio transmissions thus represents a viable approach to save energy and extend a node's operational time. In the domain of pervasive computing, where a periodic reporting of data (e.g., a user's vital parameters) is often being used, packets cannot always be simply omitted from transmission. Even if the contained data have not changed, these periodically transmitted message double as beacons to indicate that the sensor node has not run out of energy. Hence, reducing the sizes of transmitted messages remains the only available solution to achieve energy savings in such sensor networks. In this paper, we show how precomputed codebooks can be used to encode messages in an energy-efficient way and thus reduce the size of the transmitted packets. We present how we extract these code mappings from real-world data, and describe how packets are encoded prior to their transmission in order to reduce the incurred energy demand. We practically assess the energy demand on TelosB nodes and prove that up to 17.2% of energy can be saved when our approach is applied.},

Algorithms for both approaches are analyzed, as well as their combination, applied to resource-constrained devices. All algorithms are ported to the Contiki operating system, and profiled for different types of reprogramming. The presented results show that there is a clear trade-off between performance and resource requirements. Furthermore, the best reprogramming approach depends on the type of update.

With respect to poor connectivity, we observe that the presence of connectivity outliers may also result in a significant increase of the energy consumption.

abstract={With the integration of smart objects into the Internet with the help of tiny IP stacks, a direct connection between these objects and ordinary computational devices can be realized at the IP layer. As IP alone cannot ensure an automatic integration at the higher layers, an homogeneous access via services (e.g., discovery, self-configuration) for the Internet of Things vision should be provided for all connected device types. Multicast DNS and DNS Service Discovery are established and widely used standards in current IP-based networks to enable the discovery of devices and services at the application layer with DNS messages. To comply with the current Internet infrastructure, the lightweight implementation uBonjour makes mDNS and DNS-SD available on smart objects. As DNS does not meet the requirements of low data rate smart object networks, we propose to extend DNS with enhanced message compression mechanisms to effectively reduce the number of exchanged IP packets in 6LoWPANs while ensuring backward compatibility.},

abstract={Runtime migration has been widely adopted to achieve several tasks such as load balancing, performance optimization, and fault-tolerance. However, existing migration techniques do not work for event detectors in distributed publish/subscribe systems that are used to analyze sensor data. Since low-latency time-constraints are no longer valid they reorder streams incorrectly and cause erroneous event detector states. This paper presents a safe runtime migration of stateful event detectors that respects low-latency time-constraints and seamlessly orders input events correctly on the migrated host. Event streams are only forwarded until timing delays are properly calibrated, the migrated event detector immediately stops processing after its state is transferred, and the processing overhead is negligible. On a Realtime Locating System (RTLS) we show that we can efficiently migrate event detectors at runtime between servers where other techniques would fail.},

The middleware makes it possible to select on demand the algorithms that are most suitable for the current scenario.

abstract={The rapid advancement in context-aware computing techniques greatly facilitates capturing the context information of the Internet clients, which can be utilized by the Internet services and applications to manage different network resources. Based on the built context-aware system and the deduced highly abstract context information, we propose a resource distribution framework that incentivizes context sharing and moderate competition among the selfish but rational Internet clients. Under the proposed framework, the Internet client, which provides its both negative and positive context, can be assigned to the prioritized class and accordingly receive more resources from the resource owner. Meanwhile, all the clients are motivated by the framework to compete moderately and the aggressive ones are penalized by receiving fewer resources. The Web system exemplar is used to aid understanding of our motivation. We further model the resource distribution process as a non-cooperative game and accordingly provide the theoretical insight of the proposed framework.},

A distributed Ambient Intelligence (AmI) monitoring and control scenario that consists of collaborating stationary and mobile WSAN nodes with high degree of reactivity is presented. The system is designed and implemented using SystemJ to demonstrate the proposed system-level design approach. SystemJ is designed specifically to handle reactive and concurrent behaviors while providing modular and scalable methodology for distributed system composition.

abstract={In recent years, Ambient Intelligence (AmI) has attracted a number of researchers due to the widespread diffusion of unobtrusive sensing devices. The availability of such a great amount of acquired data has driven the interest of the scientific community in producing novel methods for combining raw measurements in order to understand what is happening in the monitored scenario. Moreover, due the primary role of the end user, an additional requirement of any AmI system is to maintain a high level of pervasiveness. In this paper we propose a method for recognizing human activities by means of a time of flight (ToF) depth and RGB camera device, namely Microsoft Kinect. The proposed approach is based on the estimation of some relevant joints of the human body by using Kinect depth information. The most significative configurations of joints positions are combined by a clustering approach and classified by means of a multi-class Support Vector Machine. Then, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to model each activity as a sequence of known postures. The proposed solution has been tested on a public dataset while considering four different configurations corresponding to some state-of-the-art approaches and results are very promising. Moreover, in order to maintain a high level of pervasiveness, we implemented a real prototype by connecting Kinect sensor to a miniature computer capable of real-time processing.},

abstract={To effectively exploit the potential of smart environments, an energy-efficient data exchange between the smart environment infrastructure and its users is necessary. Usually, a major building block of smart environments are different sensors, which typically communicate making use of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Opposed to this, users in a smart environment are nowadays most often equipped with smartphones, which do not support IEEE 802.15.4-based communication, but offer other standards for wireless local communication, like Bluetooth. Consequently, a major challenge in this context is the efficient integration of wireless sensor network and smartphone technology to provide users with smart environment data in a seamless fashion in real-time. To realize the necessary interconnection of sensors deployed in a smart environment and users' smartphones, different possibilities exist, which can basically be divided in extending sensors to support the communication standards offered by smartphones, or vice versa. We analyze different integration possibilities in this context and realize them prototypically. Based on real-world measurements, we evaluate the energy-efficiency of the different approaches, in particular providing a comprehensive analysis of their energy consumption.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a support system for daily living activities based on a user's behavior log in an indoor environment. Generally speaking, daily living activities hardly remain in our memory, so that, determining the order and priority of daily tasks can be difficult. There are studies supporting daily chores based on a behavior log and aiming to improve the work efficiency by using a memory aid. However, most of the existing studies require pre-installation of costly devices such as cameras and sensors, and are limited to supporting a particular task or purpose. There have been proposed many methods based on Augmented Reality (AR) which annotate captured images of the real world with texts, but text-based information may frustrate users. More intuitive user interfaces are required. In this paper, we first propose a user's behavior log management technique which associates each activity log with an object/location in the target indoor space. Then, we propose a method for reproducing AR-based visual effects on the object/location determined based on the log; the method naturally navigates the user to carrying out the intended task. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed method and have conducted subjective surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed visual effects. We thereby, confirmed that the proposed visual effects can make users more intuitively aware of the intended task than the text-based annotation method.},

abstract={Energy efficiency is a key operational characteristic of today's office environments. In this paper, we present a system architecture to control desk appliances such as computer screens based on recognised desk and computer work activities. In a real-life intervention study at seven desks, we use screen-attached ultrasound sensors and explore a proximity-based activity recognition approach for saving energy by automatically turing computer screens off when not using them. We analyse online performance of our approach regarding recognition rate and screen resume delay. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of our proximity-controlled approach against the computer-controlled power management and a non-controlled baseline to quantify energy saving benefits. Our results show energy savings of up to 43% and 55% for proximity-controlled computer screens compared to computer-controlled and non-controlled scenarios respectively.},

year={2013},

abstract={Noise pollution is among the leading causes for illness among urban residents. It constitutes a major cause for stress and poor sleep, it reduces life quality while increasing the risk for hypertension, hearing loss and lower cognitive performance. In light of those risks, the European Union mandates the creation of noise contour maps to gather information about the exposure. Those maps however often lack enough granularity to cover all areas of the city and omit large areas from the map. Hence, the public benefit from the provided information remains limited. We present SoundOfTheCity, a project with which we endeavour to put noise measurement into the hand of the citizen. To that end we developed a smart phone application that allows the users to continuously measure the loudness of their environment. The measured data are anonymised and send to a central server where all generated information from voluntary participants on a city scale are aggregated and mapped to a meaningful noise visualisation map. Moreover, the application allows for uploading sound samples, captured from the environment, as well as providing each user with information on their personal exposure to noise. Extrapolating from the current state of such participatory ambient pollution monitoring for health, we propose several questions on the future of such applications. We discuss how such systems may utilize more then just information on the distribution of pollutants, to make health monitoring more relatable to the monitored community.},

year={2013},

pages={676-681}, 
abstract={Accurate estimation of energy expenditure during exercise is important for professional athletes and casual users alike, for designing training programs and meeting their fitness goals. However, producing an accurate estimate in a mobile, wearable health-monitoring system is challenging because most calculations require knowledge of the subject's movement speed. Though determining precise movement speed is trivial on a treadmill, inaccuracies of the sensors in a mobile system have a negative impact on the accuracy of the final energy expenditure estimate. In this paper, we propose a novel method to calculate energy expenditure using sensor fusion, in which data from multiple sensors is combined to formulate the result, based on a linear-regression model. We combine data from our wearable system with embedded pulse sensor and pedometer to produce an estimate that is far more accurate than possible with the pedometer alone, reducing our mean-absolute error by 64.3%. These results indicate that it is possible to obtain an accurate energy expenditure estimate in a multi-sensor system, even with affordable, low-cost, and pervasive components that may not be accurate individually.},

abstract={Recently, many mobile techniques such as sensor networks or various types of mobile devices make it possible to provide smart services at any time, and anywhere. In despite of these remarkable advances of techniques, there are few personalized mobile recommendation services which fully consider user's current situation. Proposed recommendation algorithm efficiently defines user's current situation with situational data captured from various smartphone sensors. Also, the algorithm uses user's social network for efficiently filtering valuable items which are considered as authorities. To verify the usefulness of proposed technique, we implement a prototype of the personalized music recommendation service in which proposed recommendation technique is applied. Additionally, through the demonstration of implemented prototype, we investigate the effect of incorporating smartphone sensor data and social data to collaborative filtering algorithms.},

title={Collaborative opportunistic network coding for persistent data stream in disruptive sensor networks}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={},

pages={413-414}, 
abstract={In an energy-harvesting sensor network for perpetual lifetime, the operation of sensor nodes are synchronized with the energy fluctuations, causing the network connectivity to be disruptive and unstable. The unpredictable network disruptions and challenging communication environments make the traditional communication protocols inefficient and require a new paradigm-shift in design. In this thesis, we address several issues in collaborative data collection and storage in disruptive sensor networks. Our solutions are based on erasure codes and probabilistic network coding operations. The proposed set of algorithms improve data throughput and persistency because they are inherently amenable to probabilistic nature of transmission in wireless networks. Our contributions consist of five parts. First, we propose a collaborative data delivery protocol to exploit multiple energy-synchronized paths based on a new max-flow min-variance algorithm. In consort with this data delivery protocol, a localized TDMA MAC protocol is designed to synchronize nodes' duty-cycles and mitigate media access contentions. Second, we present Opportunistic Network Erasure Coding protocol, to collaboratively collect data in dynamic disruptive networks. ONEC derives the probability distribution of coding degree in each node and enable opportunistic in-network recoding, and guarantee the recovery of original sensor data can be achieved with high probability upon receiving any sufficient amount of encoded packets. Third, we present OnCode, an opportunistic in-network data coding and delivery protocol that provides good quality of services of data delivery under the constraints of energy synchronization. It is resilient to packet loss and network disruptions, and does not require any end-to-end feedback message. Fourth, we present a network Erasure Coding with randomized Power Control (ECPC) mechanism for data persistence in disruptive sensor networks, which only requires each node to perform a sin- le broadcast at each of its several randomly selected power levels. Thus it incurs low communication overhead. Finally, we study an integrated algorithm and protocol middleware to preserve data persistency with heterogeneous disruption probabilities across the network.},
