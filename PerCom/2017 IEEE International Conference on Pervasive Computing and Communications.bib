abstract={The pervasive computing discipline has evolved substantially since its inception. A lot of progress has been made in scaling pervasive computing, which has led to new, societal-scale capabilities such as mobile crowdsensing and the Internet of Things. Pervasive computing applications have also expanded from smart appliances and smart environments in the early days to systems of much broader scope such as smart cities and smart transportation. Going forward, an important direction is to enable a significantly heightened level of smartness in pervasive computing systems, by leveraging developments in big data and cognitive computing. Specifically, with its exponentially increasing volume, velocity and variety, big data is hailed as the world's new natural resource, and is driving fundamental changes in technology, business, and society. The biggest value of big data lies in the deep, actionable insights that can be derived from integrating all sources and modalities of data, across pervasive sensors and enterprise information systems. Such insights can then be exploited for business innovations and competitive advantages. Cognitive computing is a key enabling technology for turning big data into insights. Different from traditional programmable systems, cognitive systems are able to understand human knowledge, reason with a purpose, and learn and improve over time. Pervasive applications that integrate big data across the board and are cognitive are thus more insightful and can offer an unprecedented level of intelligence. In this talk, I will discuss the implications of big data and cognitive computing on pervasive computing. I will draw upon our experience at IBM Watson Health, and discuss how big data and cognitive computing can come together with pervasive computing to enable innovative health solutions that address many clinical, societal, and economic issues. I will present use cases, highlight the challenges, describe our approaches, and relate to client expe- iences.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={2-10}, 
abstract={This paper presents VeinDeep, a system for using vein patterns to secure smartphones from opportunistic access, e.g. a device left unattended. VeinDeep takes advantage of infrared depth sensors, which at the time of writing have recently started to appear in smartphones for 3D indoor mapping and localisation. We find these sensors can be re-purposed to capture images of the unique vein patterns on the back of each person's hand. We simulate a depth sensor equipped smartphone by developing VeinDeep on a low power Compute Stick. We use Kinect V2 depth sensor to collect 240 recordings from 40 hands belonging to 20 test subjects. Then use this data to compare VeinDeep to one older but popular vein pattern recognition algorithm which uses Hausdorff distance and one recently developed algorithm which uses Kernel distance. We achieve a precision of 0.98, compared to 0.9 for Kernel distance and 0.5 for Hausdorff distance when recall is approximately at 0.83. In addition VeinDeep does all this while taking an average of 6 MiB of memory and 466 milliseconds per comparison. This is an average of 1/6 run time, 2/3 the memory of Hausdorff distance and 1/3 the run time, 1/2 the memory of Kernel distance.},

abstract={Several new smartphones are released every year. Many people upgrade to new phones, and their old phones are not put to any further use. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using such retired smartphones and their on-board sensors to build a home security system. We observe that door-related events such as opening and closing have unique vibration signatures when compared to many types of environmental vibrational noise, which can be captured by the accelerometer of a smartphone when the phone is mounted on a wall near the door. The rotation of a door can also be captured by the magnetometer of a smartphone when the phone is mounted on a door. We design machine learning and threshold-based methods to detect door opening events based on accelerometer and magnetometer data, and build a prototype home security system that can detect door openings and notify the homeowner via email, SMS and phone calls upon break-in detection. Experiments in a residential home show that the accelerometer-based detection can detect door open events with an accuracy higher than 98%, and magnetometerbased detection has 100% accuracy.},

title={FamilyLog: A mobile system for monitoring family mealtime activities}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={21-30}, 
abstract={Research has shown that family mealtime plays a critical role in establishing good relationships among family members and maintaining their physical and mental health. In particular, regularly eating dinner as a family significantly reduces prevalence of obesity. However, American families with children spend only 1 hour on family meals while three hours watching TV on an average work day. Fine-grained activity-logging is proven effective for increasing self-awareness and motivating people to modify their life styles for improved wellness. This paper presents FamilyLog - a practical system to log family mealtime activities using smartphones and smartwatches. FamilyLog automatically detects and logs details of activities during the mealtime, including occurrence and duration of meal, conversations, participants, TV viewing etc., in an unobtrusive manner. Based on the sensor data collected from real families, we carefully design robust yet lightweight signal features from a set of complex activities during the meal, including clattering sound, arm gestures of eating, human voice, TV sound, etc. Moreover, FamilyLog opportunistically fuses data from built-in sensors of multiple mobile devices available in a family through an HMM-based classifier. To evaluate the real-world performance of FamilyLog, we perform extensive experiments that consist of 77 days of sensor data from 37 subjects in 8 families with children. Our results show that FamilyLog can detect those events with high accuracy across different families and home environments.},

title={Deep learning Parkinson's from smartphone data}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={31-40}, 
abstract={The cloudUPDRS app is a Class I medical device, namely an active transient non-invasive instrument, certified by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK for the clinical assessment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease. The app follows closely the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale which is the most commonly used protocol in the clinical study of PD; can be used by patients and their carers at home or in the community; and, requires the user to perform a sequence of iterated movements which are recorded by the phone sensors. This paper discusses how the cloudUPDRS system addresses two key challenges towards meeting essential consistency and efficiency requirements, namely: (i) How to ensure high-quality data collection especially considering the unsupervised nature of the test, in particular, how to achieve firm user adherence to the prescribed movements; and (ii) How to reduce test duration from approximately 25 minutes typically required by an experienced patient, to below 4 minutes, a threshold identified as critical to obtain significant improvements in clinical compliance. To address the former, we combine a bespoke design of the user experience tailored so as to constrain context, with a deep learning approach used to identify failures to follow the movement protocol while at the same time limiting false positives to avoid unnecessary repetition. We address the latter by developing a machine learning approach to personalise assessments by selecting those elements of the UPDRS protocol that most closely match individual symptom profiles and thus offer the highest inferential power hence closely estimating the patent's overall UPRDS score.},

year={2017}, 
volume={},

pages={41-49}, 
abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to allow everyday objects to connect to the Internet and seamlessly interact with users and other machines. For this vital Internet connection, most current IoT devices use a personal gateway device such as a smartphone or a home WiFi access point. The necessity of configuring and maintaining these gateways presents an additional burden for both users and developers of IoT applications. Our vision for IoT connectivity is to eliminate the need for the personal gateway by developing crowdsourced low-power wide area networks (csLPWAN). Recent technologies such as RPMA, LoRa, and R-FDMA enable links to reach 15km using ISM-band transceivers, making csLPWANs an attractive option. In this paper, we investigate the practicality of csLPWANs and develop the first csLPWAN planning tool, PlanIt, which combines topography-aware RF signal analysis with demographic data to predict LPWAN coverage in specific geographic areas. Using PlanIt, we find that most cities achieve 99% coverage by deploying a single LPWAN base station within the city. To provide better service on the csLPWAN, we propose and evaluate D-QN, a near-optimal MAC protocol to enable efficient bandwidth sharing in highly utilized networks. In the future, csLPWANs could accommodate a heterogeneous set of IoT applications, simplifying the IoT application development cycle, reducing total system cost, improving application reliability, and enhancing the user experience.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={50-58}, 
abstract={This paper aims to improve wireless network throughput by suppressing duplicate data transmissions from network links. It has been demonstrated that IP-layer Redundancy Elimination (RE) with content overhearing can significantly improve the goodput and utilization of wireless channels in wireless environment. However, the integration of IP-layer RE and wireless overhearing introduces a challenge. That is, probabilistic wireless overhearing and the possibility of a receiver overhearing from multiple transmitters cause the caches of a sender and a receiver far from synchronization, which can disrupt IP-layer RE's correctness and degrade its performance. The previous work deals with this challenge by the overhearing probability estimation, which however is not efficient or scalable. In this paper, we propose a Prediction-based Redundancy Elimination with Content Overhearing method (PRECO) to address this challenge. By exploiting prediction-based RE, PRECO does not require cache synchronization and overhearing probability estimation, which enables its efficient and scalable deployment. Based on PRECO, we exploit the benefits of deploying sub-packet level RE as a primitive IP-layer service on all nodes in wireless mesh networks by proposing a redundancy-aware routing protocol. Trace-driven performance evaluation shows the effectiveness and efficiency of PRECO compared with other RE methods.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={59-68}, 
abstract={Auction based participant selection has been widely used for mobile crowd sensing (MCS) to achieve user incentive and assignment optimization. However, mobile crowd sensing problems solved with auction-based approaches usually involve participants' privacy concerns because a participant's bids may contain her private information (such as location visiting patterns), and disclosure participants' bids may disclose their private information as well. In this paper, we study how to protect such bid privacy in a temporally and spatially dynamic MCS system. We assume that both sensing tasks and mobile participants have dynamic characteristics over spatial and temporal domains. Following the classical VCG auction, we carefully design a scalable grouping based privacy-preserving participant selection scheme, which leverages Lagrange polynomial interpolation to perturb participants' bids within groups. The proposed solution does not affect the operation of current MCS platform. Both theoretical analysis and real-life tracing data simulations verify the efficiency and security of the proposed solution.},

title={An enhanced DSM model for computation offloading}, 
year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={69-78}, 
abstract={The distributed shared memory (DSM)-based computation offloading scheme allows collaborative multiple threads to dynamically migrate and execute across a mobile device and computing nodes. Despite this strong advantage, it misses a significant portion of the potential performance gain because the traditional DSM model is suboptimal for computation offloading. This paper proposes an enhanced DSM model that aims to enable multiple computing nodes to efficiently and reliably offload concurrent multiple threads from a mobile device. To achieve this design goal, we propose the following novel schemes: (a) selective object tracking minimizes the set of objects to be monitored by the DSM layer; (b) lock-thread repartitioning dynamically relocates threads and locks in order to reduce remote lock acquisitions and inter-node synchronizations; and (c) thread-state checkpointing protects the data and context upon unexpected system failures. We implemented METEOR, which is a prototype based on the proposed schemes, and evaluated it with diverse applications. The evaluation showed that METEOR, with four computing nodes, improved the performance by up to 109% and reduced energy consumption by up to 52% in comparison with the previous DSM-based offloading scheme.},

pages={79-88}, 
abstract={Scheduling in distributed computing systems is the process of allocating resources to a computational task. The complexity of this allocation process increases with the amount of criteria that are considered for the scheduling decision. Pervasive computing systems show a high degree of heterogeneity and dynamism. The constant joining and leaving of devices makes the system error-prone and less predictable. The involved devices differ in various properties that we subsume as their context. We argue, that these context dimensions can be used to implement fault-avoidant scheduling strategies. In this paper, we introduce the concept of context-aware scheduling for pervasive computing systems. The schedulers in these systems consider multiple context dimensions to avoid failing resource providers. We discuss relevant context dimensions, develop context-aware scheduling strategies and implement them into an existing distributed computing system. We show how to monitor the context dimensions and evaluate the fault-avoidant scheduling strategies in a large-scale simulation.},

abstract={Summary form only given. We are all people who have a definite location, but our intuitions about people and their locations are not always correct. Fortunately, researchers have been looking at how people behave with respect to location, and they have discovered surprising facts that do not necessarily match our assumptions. For example, as technologists, we tend to assume that people have strong concerns about their location privacy. But is this really true? As another example, researchers have tried to show that the same models of location behavior apply to both people and animals. Does this survive scrutiny? And if people exhibit complex behavior in terms of location, does this mean it is difficult to predict where they will go in the future? Not necessarily. The last few decades have seen principled answers to these and other questions, with research driven by growing demand for mobile computing, increasing availability of location data, and expanding problems in transportation. In this talk I will present several ways that our intuition about people and location does not match reality.},

abstract={The ability to detect and distinguish interactions in the workplace can shed light over productivity, team work and on employees' use of space. Questionnaires and direct observations have often been used as mechanisms to identify office based interactions, however, these are either very time consuming, yield coarse grained information or do not scale to large numbers of people. Technology has been recently employed to cut costs and improve output, however precise interaction dynamics gathering often requires individuals to wear custom hardware. In this paper, we present an extensive evaluation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as a technology to monitor people proximity in the workplace. We examine the key parameters that affect the accuracy of the detected contacts and their impact on power consumption. We study how this system can be implemented on popular wearable devices (i.e., Android Wear and Tizen) and the resulting limitations. Through a real world deployment in a commercial organisation with 25 participants we evaluate the performances of a BLE-based proximity detection technique. Our results show the suitability of BLE for workplace interaction detection and give guidance to vendors and Operating System (OS) developers on the impact of the restrictions regarding the use of BLE on commodity wearables.},

pages={100-110}, 
abstract={In today's advancing ubiquitous computing age, with its ever-increasing amount of information from various applications and services available for consumption, the management of people's attention has become very important. In particular, the high volume of notifications on mobile devices has become a major cause of interruption of users. There has been much research aimed at detecting the opportune moment to present such information to users with in a way that lowers the cognitive load or frustration. However, evaluation of such systems in the real-world production environment with real users and notifications, and evaluation on user's engagement to the presented notification beyond simple responsiveness have not been adequately studied. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate user interruptibility and engagement using a real-world large-scale mobile application and real-world notifications consisting of actual news content. We equipped the Yahoo! JAPAN Android app, one of the most popular applications on the national market, with our mobile-sensing and machine-learning-based interruptibility estimation logic. We conducted a large-scale in-the-wild user study with more than 680,000 users for three weeks. The results show that in most cases delaying the notification delivery until an interruptible moment is detected is beneficial to users and results in significant reduction of user response time (49.7%) compared to delivering the notifications immediately. We also observed a higher number of notifications opened in our system as well as constant improvement in user engagement levels throughout the entire study period.},

abstract={Currently, various hardware and software companies are developing augmented reality devices, most prominently Microsoft with its Hololens. Besides gaming, such devices can be used for serious pervasive applications, like interactive mobile simulations to support engineers in the field. Interactive simulations have high demands on resources, which the mobile device alone is unable to satisfy. Therefore, we propose a framework to support mobile simulations by distributing the computation between mobile device and a remote server. For the computation of parameter-dependent solutions of the simulation, we use the reduced basis method, which allows to drastically reduce the computation time and energy consumption. We present three approaches for the distributed execution of the reduced basis method between mobile device and server. Evaluations show that we can speed-up the numerical computation to over 131 times while using 73 times less energy compared to offloading everything to a server.},

abstract={There are currently few options for navigational aids for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) in large indoor spaces.

This paper presents an indoor wayfinding system called GuideBeacon for the blind, visually impaired, and disoriented (BVID) that assists people in navigating between any two points within indoor environments. The GuideBeacon system allows users equipped with smartphones to interact with low cost Bluetooth-based beacons deployed strategically within the indoor space of interest to navigate their surroundings. This paper describes the technical challenges faced in designing such a system, the design decisions made in building the current version of the GuideBeacon system, the solutions developed to meet the technical challenges, and results from the evaluation of the system. Results presented in this paper obtained from field testing GuideBeacon with BVI and sighted participants suggests that it can be used by the BVID for navigation in large indoor spaces independently and effectively.},

abstract={State-of-the-art indoor localization techniques can reach high localization accuracy, but rely on widely deployed infrastructure which may be absent in less developed regions. To achieve infrastructure-free indoor localization, researchers have proposed to use the inertial sensors on the mobile devices to update the users potential locations by walking steps. Such methods are known to accumulate errors and degrade drastically over time. To compensate for it, either a wall-constraint that eliminates possible steps going through the walls, or landmarks correspond to the special user activities, are usually employed. However, these approaches still suffer from slow convergence and cannot detect floor changes automatically without the information from other users. In this paper, we propose LocMe, an indoor localization service based on human locomotion detection and map exploitation. By synergizing both the locomotion-constraint and wall-constraint, LocMe can significantly increase the converging speed of localization and automatically detect the floor changes, with negligible extra complexity. Our field tests show that LocMe can achieve a median localization error of 1.1 m, which is over 68% lower than the localization algorithm with only the wall-constraint in the same test condition.},

abstract={Indoor positioning is a core technology for indoor daily life applications such as elderly care and home automation. This study presents a device-free and privacy preserving indoor positioning method using infrared (IR) cameras and retroreflectors. The proposed method uses IR cameras equipped with IR LEDs to capture retroreflections from markers attached to walls in the environment, and detects a person who passes between the camera and a marker by observing the occlusion. Because our method employs occlusion of markers, it can track a person without attaching tags to the person. Also, our camera device permits us to filter out visible light and thus the appearance of the person is not recorded. Our evaluation in real environments showed that our method achieved an average positioning error of about 0.3 meters.},

abstract={We present Lift, a visible light-enabled finger tracking and object localization technique that allows users to perform freestyle multi-touch gestures on any object's surface in an everyday environment. By projecting encoded visible patterns onto an object's surface (e.g. paper, display, or table), and localizing the user's fingers with light sensors, Lift offers users a richer interactive space than the device's existing interfaces. Additionally, everyday objects can be augmented by attaching sensor units onto their surface to accept multi-touch gesture input. We also present two applications as proof of concept. Finally, results from our experiments indicate that Lift can localize ten fingers simultaneously with an average accuracy of 1.7 millimeter and an average refresh rate of 84 Hz with 31 milliseconds delay on WiFi and 23 milliseconds delay on serial communication, making gesture recognition on non-instrumented objects possible.},

abstract={In this paper we introduce a novel engineering system for tracking animal movements. Study of animal movement has implications in several relevant and challenging research areas, i.e., from ornithology to global ecology and wildlife management. Inspired by the Internet-of-things vision, the proposed tracking system relies on GSM-based tracking devices that are directly connected to the GSM network to remotely transmit/exchange data with Application Servers/Cloud. The novel characteristic of the proposed GSM-based tracking system is the use of the GSM network for both localization and transmission. This allows to simplify the design of both hardware and software, hence reducing, size, weight and cost of the GSM-based tracking device as well as the fieldwork effort necessary to obtain tracking data. Moreover, this joint localization/transmission phase allows to reduce the energy consumption of the GSM-based tracking device, hence prolonging the life-time of the system and increasing the Quality-of-Service of the envisaged tracking application. We performed a detailed energy assessment of the GSM-based tracking device, while the whole GSM-based tracking system has been tested in a real deployment on four greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) for approximately 11 months in Northern Italy.},

abstract={This paper investigates the possibility of using a vibration energy harvesting (VEH) device as a communication receiver. By modulating the ambient vibration energy using a transmitting speaker, and demodulating the harvested power at the receiving VEH, we aim to transmit small amounts of data at low rates between two proximate devices. The key advantage of using VEH as a receiver is that the modulated sound waves can be successfully demodulated directly from the harvested power without employing the power-consuming digital signal processing (DSP), which makes a VEH receiver significantly more power efficient than a conventional microphone-based decoder. To address the extremely narrow bandwidth of VEH, we design a simple ON-OFF keying modulation, but optimized for VEH hardware. Experiments with a real VEH device shows that, at a distance of 2 cm, a laptop speaker with the proposed modulation scheme can achieve 30 bps communication for a target bit error rate of less than 1%, which would enable many emerging short range applications, such as mobile payment. The communication range of a laptop can be extended to 80 cm for 5 bps, allowing a range of other audio-based device-to-device communications, such as a web advertisement on a laptop browser transferring tokens to a nearby smartphone. We also demonstrate that the proposed VEH-based sound decoding is resilient to background noise, thanks to its extremely narrow power harvesting bandwidth, which works as a natural noise filter.},

Further, to adapt such a model to the behavior of a new user, we present a personalization approach that relies on online and active machine learning. In this context, we use online random forest as a classifier to continuously adapt the model without keeping the already seen data available and an active learning approach that uses user-feedback for adapting the model while minimizing the effort for the new user. We test our approaches on a real world data set that covers 15 participants, 8 common activities, and 7 different on-body device positions. We show that our cross-subjects based approach performs constantly +3% better than the standard approach.

abstract={Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are formed by a huge number of vehicles which act as the network nodes and communicate with one another. This emerging paradigm has opened up new business opportunities and enables numerous applications ranging from road safety enhancement to mobile entertainment. A fundamental issue that impacts the successful deployment of VANET applications is the security and privacy concerns raised by VANET users. However, it is a challenging task to authenticate vehicles while fully preserving their privacy. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving randomized authentication protocol that leverages Homomorphic encryption to allow each individual vehicle to self-generate any number of authenticated identities to achieve full anonymity in VANETs. The proposed protocol prevents vehicles from being tracked by any single party including peer vehicles, service providers, authentication servers, and other infrastructure. Meanwhile, our protocol also provides traceability in case of any dispute. We have conducted both security analysis and experimental study which demonstrates the superiority of our protocol compared to other existing works.},

abstract={Greenhouse gas emission by the increasing number of vehicles have become a significant problem in modern cities. To save energy and protect environment, recommending fuel-efficient routes to drivers becomes a promising way to alleviate this issue. To this end, in this paper, we present a novel fuel-efficient path-planning framework called GreenPlanner, which contains two phases. In the first phase, we build a personalized fuel consumption model (PFCM) for each driver, based on the individual driving behaviors and the physical features (e.g., traffic lights, stop signs, road network topology) along the routes. In the second phase, with the real-time traffic information collected via the mobile crowdsensing manner, we are able to estimate and compare the cost fuel among different routes for a given driver, and recommend him/her with the most fuel-efficient one. We evaluate the two-phase framework using the real-world datasets, consisting of road network, POI, the GPS trajectory data and the OBD-II data generated by 559 taxis in one day in the city of Beijing, China. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline models, the proposed model achieves the best accuracy, with a mean fuel consumption error of less 7% for paths longer than 10 km. Moreover, users could save about 20% fuel consumption on average if driving along our suggested routes in our case studies.},

year={2017},

pages={217-226}, 
abstract={Ground transport infrastructures require in-situ monitoring to evaluate their condition and deterioration and to design appropriate preventive maintenance strategies. Current monitoring practices provide accurate and detailed spatial measurements but often lack the required temporal resolution. This is because the large scale of these infrastructures and the expensive equipments required for monitoring activities do not allow running very frequent measurement campaigns. In this paper, we present RoVi, a novel smartphone-based framework for continuous monitoring of a number of health and condition indicators for variety of ground infrastructures and assets. These indicators include railroad track geometry features such as Cant, Twist, Curvature, and Alignment for different segment lengths as well as road and bike path roughness index (i.e., an equivalent to the International Roughness Index, the so called IRI). RoVi uses an optimized processing algorithm technique on data acquired by smartphones' inertial sensors and relies on sensing, processing power, and networking capabilities of smartphones carried by car/bike drivers and train passengers to provide real time space-time information for fine-grained monitoring of infrastructures. It utilizes the crowd sensing concept to fill in the gap between current sparse consecutive inspections. RoVi provides a reliable and accurate analytic tool for engineers and maintenance planners by offering them features and indicators they require for asset management and maintenance planning. We extract these features and indicators from noisy smartphone data utilizing adaptive signal processing techniques followed by feature calculations and geo-location visualization. Our fast data aggregation algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation updates profiles with new measurements arriving in real time from smartphones. By doing so, it tackles the notorious problem of smartphone GPS accuracy. Performance evaluation of our framework has be- n performed on measurements collected by smartphones and compared with the ground truth measurements collected by the highend measurement vehicles (i.e., ARAN for roads and UMF120 measurement train for railroads).},

In certain scenarios, however, attaching tags to objects may be impractical due to cost and protection issues. In this paper, we propose TagFree, a novel object differentiation scheme without attaching tags. Instead of relying on external tags, we exploit the inherent radiometric properties of different objects as their signatures. To improve the robustness and efficiency of TagFree, we empirically determine a spatial safe zone and harness successive cancellation to distinguish multiple objects simultaneously. We prototype TagFree on commercial WiFi infrastructure and evaluate its performance in various indoor scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that TagFree achieves single object distinguishing accuracy of 96% measured at the same location, and over 80% within the safe zone range of up to 3m along a 7m link. TagFree can also differentiate up to 3 objects with acceptable accuracy.},

Nevertheless, existing solutions mostly rely on either pre-deployed infrastructures or user device participation, thus hampering their wide adoption. This paper presents CeilingSee, a dedicated occupancy inference system free of heavy infrastructure deployments and user involvements. Building upon existing LED lighting systems, CeilingSee converts part of the ceiling-mounted LED luminaires to act as sensors, sensing the variances in diffuse reflection caused by occupants. In realizing CeilingSee, we first re-design the LED driver to leverage LED's photoelectric effect so as to transform a light emitter to a light sensor. In order to produce accurate occupancy inference, we then engineer efficient learning algorithms to fuse sensing information gathered by multiple LED luminaires. We build a testbed covering a 30m2 office area; extensive experiments show that CeilingSee is able to achieve very high accuracy in occupancy inference.},

abstract={With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), users are more likely to have privacy concerns since their personal information could be collected, analyzed, and utilized without notice by the networked IoT devices and services. Users may want to control all such activities by explicitly expressing their privacy preferences. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to do so, not only because of the cognitive burden of continuously making privacy decisions for IoT services, but also because IoT devices have no, or only very restricted, user interfaces. Intelligent software helping users make better privacy decisions will be an important component of privacy-preserving IoT environments. In order to construct such a component, we aim to verify whether it will be possible to computationally model and predict users' privacy preferences in IoT. To that end, we survey 172 participants in a simulated campuswide IoT environment about their privacy preferences regarding hypothetical personal information tracking scenarios. Then, we cluster the scenarios based on the survey responses, arriving at four clusters with distinct associated privacy preferences. Based on the clustering results, we uncover contextual factors that induce privacy violations in IoT. Finally, we build machine learning models to predict users' privacy decisions, using both contextual information and the corresponding cluster membership as training data. The final trained model shows 77% accuracy in predicting users' decisions whether or not to allow the respective IoT scenario.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={286-296}, 
abstract={With the rapid digitalization of the health sector, people often turn to mobile apps and online health websites for health advice. Health advice generated from different sources can be conflicting as they address different aspects of health (e.g., weight loss, diet, disease) or as they are unaware of the context of a user (e.g., age, gender, physiological condition). Conflicts can occur due to lexical features, (such as, negation, antonyms, or numerical mismatch) or can be conditioned upon time and/or physiological status. We formulate the problem of finding conflicting health advice and develop a comprehensive taxonomy of conflicts. While a similar research area in the natural language processing domain explores the problem of textual contradiction identification, finding conflicts in health advice poses its own unique lexical and semantic challenges. These include large structural variation between text and hypothesis pairs, finding conceptual overlap between pairs of advice, and inference of the semantics of an advice (i.e., what to do, why and how). Hence, we develop Preclude, a novel semantic rule-based solution to detect conflicting health advice derived from heterogeneous sources utilizing linguistic rules and external knowledge bases. As our solution is interpretable and comprehensive, it can guide users towards conflict resolution too. We evaluate Preclude using 1156 real advice statements covering 8 important health topics that are collected from smart phone health apps and popular health websites. Preclude results in 90% accuracy and outperforms the accuracy and F1 score of the baseline approach by about 1.5 times and 3 times, respectively.},

abstract={Mobile app testing and evaluation requires exposing the app to a wide array of real world context conditions viz. location, sensor values, network conditions etc. Such comprehensive context conditions are difficult to create in a development environment on a real device, therefore, simulating them in a mobile emulator is a promising alternative. We present ContextMonkey, a framework for context generation in a mobile emulator. ContextMonkey can generate realistic context by leveraging traces in correlated and interdependent way from heterogenous sources: remote trace databases, models, and trace files. It eases the burden on developers to collect correlated traces, convert them to a common format, and feed them to the emulator in an orchestrated manner. We present examples demonstrating the simplicity and potential of ContextMonkey in app testing scenarios.},

abstract={Pervasive applications evolve around the user's context, making it a full-fledged communication party. However, no equivalent approach to End-to-End communication exists that allows a sender to bind data, through encryption, to a target context. Existing solutions require central infrastructures or only apply to the immediate context, restricting pervasive applications. We propose Encryption to Trusted Contexts (ETC), a communication security building block that enforces context bindings while preserving the data handling and forwarding mechanisms of the original application. Our approach leverages a Broadcast Encryption scheme to protect data in transit and binds decryption to the verification of an expressive, flexible context specification based on trusted, unforgeable sensing. Data can then be encrypted from and to any context, securely exchanged among devices, and made accessible only within the specified context. We demonstrate the feasibility of ETC in a prototypical implementation for ARM TrustZone devices, realizing communication security for context-driven, pervasive applications.},
