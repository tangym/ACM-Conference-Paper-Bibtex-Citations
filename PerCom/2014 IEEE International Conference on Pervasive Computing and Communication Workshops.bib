pages={1-9}, 
abstract={Many context-aware smartphone applications depend on specific conditions for gathering data, e.g., specific phone locations or orientations. As a result, the significant overhead of keeping all this information in mind is imposed on their users. Besides averting the interest of potential application users, these requirements defeat one of the main purposes of these mobile data collection, namely simplifying life through mobile sensing applications. This is not a problem that solely affects the users, but the developers of the applications alike. As even the most diligent users often do not manage to follow the strict data collection guidelines at all times, errors in the collected data may ultimately lead to the provision of wrong services and thus to degraded application quality. In this paper, we thus present a solution to determine the location of a phone in order to support context-aware applications. It offers the possibility to detect the position of the phone with an accuracy of 97 %, as well as being able to correlate it with the type of the location of the user. Our system can be used to improve existing mobile sensing applications by facilitating various services that depend on the phone location, e.g., seamlessly adapting the ringtone volume or setting a phone's flight mode.},

title={Self-calibration of walking speed estimations using smartphone sensors}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={10-18}, 
abstract={Activity recognition for human behavior monitoring is an important research topic in the field of mHealth, especially for aspects of physical activity linked to fitness and disease progress, such as walking and walking speed. Sensors embedded into smartphones recently enabled new opportunities for non invasive activity and walking speed inference. In this paper, we propose a data fusion approach to the problem of physical activity recognition and walking speed estimation using smartphones. Our architecture combines different sensors to take into account practical issues arising in realistic settings, such as variability in phone location and orientation. Additionally, we introduce a novel automatic calibration methodology combining accelerometer and GPS data while walking in unconstrained settings, in order to reduce walking speed estimation error at the individual level. The proposed system was validated in 20 participants while performing sedentary, household, ambulatory and sport activities, in both indoor laboratory and outdoor self-paced settings. We show that by combining accelerometer and gyroscope data, smartphone location can be distinguished between the two most commonly used positions (bag and pocket), regardless of phone orientation (97 % f-score). Location-specific activity recognition models can significantly improve activity recognition performance (p = 0.0010 <; α), especially helping in distinguishing activities involving similar motion patterns (91 % f-score overall, improvements between 4% and 11 % for walking and biking activities). Our proposed method to personalize walking speed estimates, by automatically calibrating walking speed estimation models during a short self-paced walk, reduced walking speed estimation error by 8.8% on average (p = 0.0012 <; α).},

pages={19-26}, 
abstract={We investigate the recognition of phone placement in the vicinity of their user using different pattern classification strategies and phone-integrated sensors. The novel approach in our work is to use RFID tags for annotating phone placement. We use the NFC function of smartphones to continuously read tags during training data acquisition at different phone sites. We show that the RFID-based annotation approach requires minimal effort from users to acquire annotated data, enabling users to personalise phone placement recognition. In an evaluation study with 39 hours of phone placement recordings from six participants and four frequently used phone sites, we compare the annotation accuracy of our RFID-based approach to expert-verified annotations. Our results show that RFID-based annotations perform approx. 2 % below the expert-verified variant. Personalised classification models outperform models trained from all participants, suggesting that our RFID-based approach is viable for a personalised phone placement recognition. Sub-sequently, we analyse the amount of training data, sensors, and features required to achieve an average recognition rate of 80 %.},

pages={27-35}, 
abstract={Mitigating the consequences of disruptive smartphone interruptions remains a challenging problem for smartphone designers. Proposed solutions often incorporate machine-learning techniques with remedies that include delaying user notifications until an opportune moment or changing the intensity and/or mode of the notification (fewer rings, vibration mode). This paper describes a new machine-learning approach that aims to maintain the quality of mitigation under concept drift - unforeseen changes in context or the user's behaviour over time. We demonstrate our approach by developing an application for Android phones to mitigate disruptive phone calls (RingLearn). We report on a field trial of the application conducted over 2 months with 10 users and suggest that long-term mitigation can be practical with careful design that addresses concept drift.},

abstract={We describe a novel algorithm for the spotting and recognition of human activities from motion sensor signals. Our work focuses on being able to deal with the variability of human actions including user independent training. The core idea is that most actions can be divided into segments that allow a high degree of variability and segments that, due to physical constraints, have to be executed in a fairly invariant way. In the paper we present a method for identifying such segments and using them for the spotting and classification of complex activities. We evaluate our method on a well known car assembly data set and show that it performs significantly better than previous approaches.},

abstract={In order to automatically control the environment, smart systems should have sufficient rules, which describe expected system's behavior. While such rules may be added man-ually, usually this requires considerable efforts, often surpassing those that users are willing to spend to setup the system. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to mine such rules automatically, given a sensor log from the environment. In particular, we mine itemsets, but we consider abnormal drops in the frequency of variable state combinations w.r.t. the frequency of their subsets, which represent undesirability of these combinations. We evaluate the technique both on simulated and real datasets, showing that the approach is effective and promising for further extensions.},

abstract={We present a motion-adaptive duty-cycling approach to estimate orientation using inertial sensors. In particular, we deploy a proportional forward-controller to adjust the duty-cycle of inertial sensing units (IMU) and the orientation estimation update rate of an extended Kalman filter (EKF). In sample data recordings and a simulated daily life dataset from a wrist-worn IMU, we show that our motion-adaptive approach incurs substantially lower errors that a static duty-cycling approach. During phases with low or no rotation motion, as it is often occurring in daily activities, our approach can dynamically reduce the IMU operation to 20% of the regular rate. Results show that duty-cycles of 50% are common during low-wrist rotation activities, such as reading and typing, while orientation error is below 1°. We further show the power saving benefits of our approach in a case study of the ETHOS IMU device.},

abstract={We present a novel stochastic recognition model based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) that uses a minimal set of features derived from ultrasound ranging sensors (USR) to detect presence at the desk area. In our approach, USR sensors are mounted at desk screens to provide proximity estimations of objects and users in front of them. Based on continuous proximity estimations of two screen-attached USRs, features were extracted that describe distance and motion of the user and objects. Our approach provides instantaneous presence estimation results, which is essential for energy saving, e.g. when controlling computer screens. In our evaluation with 16 users during 8 working days, we achieved a normalized recognition accuracy of more than 90%. Furthermore, we compare the KDE-based approach to established algorithms, including Nearest Centroid (NC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results indicate that our KDE-based approach outperforms other algorithms using a combination of scripted data for training, and real-world recordings for testing. Finally, we show a timing study indicating that our approach is feasible to be implemented in a real-world setting.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Smartphones have become a pervasive technology as they are not only a powerful multimedia device but also offer a rich sensing platform with a plethora of built-in sensors, such as temperature, light, GPS, accelerometers, and so on. Smartphones also provide multiple wireless interfaces (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi, cellular) to connect to the external sensors and the Internet. This has led to what is called participatory urban sensing in which users participate in the sensing campaign by continuously monitoring the surrounding environ-ment, collecting and transmitting multi-modal data streams. For example, users may send sensed information and opinions about current events (e.g., weather condition, real-time traffic or accidents, environmental noise and pollution monitoring, crime scenes, healthcare, social sensing, physical activity and well-being), thus leading to important inferences and decision making. This talk will highlight the challenges and unique opportunities in the emerging field of participatory urban sensing. Significant challenges include energy efficiency (i.e., battery life) of mobile devices, spatio-temporal uncertainty, sensing coverage and localization, user incentives for participation, reliability and quality of sensed data, big data and scaling issues, location and data privacy, trust and security. New solutions will be presented to address some of these issues along with experimental results from Android phones. The talk will be concluded with directions for future research.},

abstract={Participatory sensing applications have an on-going requirement to turn raw data into useful knowledge, and to achieve this, many rely on prompt human generated meta-data to support and/or validate the primary data payload. These human contributions are inherently error prone and subject to bias and inaccuracies, so multiple overlapping labels are needed to cross-validate one another. While probabilistic inference can be used to reduce the required label overlap, there is still a need to minimise the overhead and improve the accuracy of timely label collection. We present three general algorithms for efficient human meta-data collection, which support different constraints on how the central authority collects contributions, and three methods to intelligently pair annotators with tasks based on formal information theoretic principles. We test our methods' performance on challenging synthetic data-sets, based on real data, and show that our algorithms can significantly lower the cost and improve the accuracy of human meta-data labelling, with little or no impact on time.},

volume={},

pages={68-73}, 
abstract={Participatory sensing projects typically rely on time-based polling or volunteer-initiated data collection. We have investigated the potential benefits of managed sensing, in which requests for information are targeted at particular volunteers as they visit locations of interest. We performed a study comprising of 24 volunteers who were asked to report sightings of bees whilst visiting gardens over a 400m by 400m area. We found that compared to a baseline periodic polling strategy, the centralised management approach achieved 8.6% larger sampling coverage of the visited area with 4 times less wasted participant effort. We investigated the parameter sensitivity of the results in simulation. We show that the results are statistically significant, and that participant response time to questions is the most influential parameter. Centralised management is more effective than simpler approaches if participants respond within 3 minutes, and equivalent for longer response times. Both the experimental and simulated results are informative for parameter and management choices for future participatory sensing studies.},

abstract={Nowadays cities invest more in their public services, and particularly digital ones, to improve their resident's quality of life and attract more people. Thus, new crowdsourcing services appear and they are based on contributions made by mobile users equipped with smartphones. For example, the respect of the traffic code is essential to ensure citizens' security and welfare in their city. In this paper, we present CrowdOut, a new mobile crowdsourcing service for improving road safety in cities. CrowdOut allows users to report traffic offence they witness in real time and to map them on a city plan. CrowdOut service has been implemented and experiments and demonstrations have been performed in the urban environment of the Grand Nancy, in France. This service allows users appropriating their urban environment with an active participation regarding the collectivity. This service also represents a tool for city administrators to help for decisions and improve their urbanization policy, or to check the impact of their policy in the city environment.},

abstract={Crowd sensing is an approach to collect many samples of a phenomena of interest by distributing the sampling across a large number of individuals. While any one individual may not provide sufficient samples, aggregating samples across many individuals may provide high-quality and high-coverage measurements of a phenomena. In this work, we propose an incentive assignment mechanism for crowd sensing variable phenomena (e.g., temperature) that balances the goal of maximizing coverage of the area of interest, while at the same time staying within a budget constraint. This algorithm not only takes into account the area covered by the participants' sensors, but also the spread of these sensors through a target area. This characteristic enables more representative sampling than existing methods, assuming the same budget. Compared to existing methods, this algorithm improves the spread of the set of acquired samples by more than 56 % percent, without sacrificing the number of samples purchased from human sensors.},

title={Gamification-based incentive mechanism for participatory sensing}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={98-103}, 
abstract={Since participatory sensing relies on users' active participation, several monetary incentive mechanisms for attracting users' participation have been proposed. However, to make users participate in “heavy” sensing tasks (either physically or mentally), stronger incentive is required. Thus, the total amount of rewards paid by the client will quickly rise. In this paper, we propose a novel incentive mechanism based on gamification for participatory sensing to reduce the total amount of rewards paid by the client. The proposed incentive mechanism incorporates a status level scheme depending on earned reward points like airline's mileage services, so that users with higher status can earn more reward points. We also introduce a ranking scheme among users and a badge scheme based on gamification so that users are attracted by getting not only monetary reward points but also sense of accomplishment. We formulate the problem of sensing given PoI (points of interest) with minimal reward points and devise a heuristic algorithm for deriving the set of users to which requests are sent and appropriate reward points for each request. The algorithm requires the participation probability distribution for each tuple of a user, reward points, and the burden of a sensing task. To obtain the probability distribution, we implemented a prototype of a participatory sensing system with the proposed incentive mechanism and conducted an experiment with 18 users for 30 days. As a result, we confirmed that the gamification mechanism increased participation probability from 53% (without gamification) to 73%.},

In this architecture we use the Message Queue Telemetry Transport protocol (MQTT) to exchange messages between the system components. Work orders and alerts are modelled using the Common Alert Protocol (CAP) and sent to the augmented reality application through the ITA Information fabric; a middleware component using MQTT augmented with policy, workflow and datastore. We describe the high-level architecture supporting the experimentation and services provision, access policies and security aspects of such an architecture. This architecture can encapsulate the system functionality, assure the interoperability between various component systems, integrate different data standards, and ease the maintenance, management and upgrading of building assets and service requests. The design of a smart building application based on this architecture is illustrated and experimentation results confirm the viability and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

abstract={The concept of smart cities envisions services that provide distraction-free support for citizens. To realize this vision, the services must adapt to the citizens' situations, behaviors and intents at runtime. This requires services to gather and process the context of their users. Mobile devices provide a promising basis for determining context in an automated manner on a large scale. However, despite the wide availability of versatile programmable mobile platforms such as Android and iOS, there are only few examples of smart city applications. One reason for this is that existing software platforms primarily focus on low-level resource management which requires application developers to repeatedly tackle many challenging tasks. Examples include efficient data acquisition, secure and privacy-preserving data distribution as well as interoperable data integration. In this paper, we describe the GAMBAS middleware which tries to simplify the development of smart city applications. To do this, GAMBAS introduces a Java-based runtime system with an associated software development kit (SDK). To clarify how the runtime system and the SDK can be used for application development, we describe two simple applications that highlight different middleware functions.},

To take full advantage of opportunities arising from connectivity, smart things approached the application realm bringing the novel Web of Things vision to life. In this paper, we propose an approach for modeling and implementing the Web of Things for a Smart City environment that relies on a lightweight implementation of Linked Data. We represent a smart thing as a graph of granular and individually addressable information pieces called IDN-Document. IDN-Documents are structured web resources that can be aggregated, reused and combined to build collaboration oriented services. IDN-Documents can be managed by the InterDataNet (IDN) middleware, which allows to easily publish and handling resources on the web by leveraging the Linked Data and Representational State Transfer paradigms. We also provide a tool suite for supporting developers with easy-to-use tools in designing and developing web applications according to our Web of Things implementation approach. These technologies are currently under experimentation in the real smart city of Santander, Spain, in the context of the SmartSantader European project.},

abstract={With the emergence of Smart City concept, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) become one of the key technologies for instrumenting the city, and thus providing its inhabitants with various services meant to improve their daily life. One of the identified applications is Smart Street Lightning, where the lamps are in a mesh network for remote control and maintenance purposes. This paper proposes Ubiquitous Navigation System (UNS), a WSN-based navigation system, which takes benefit from the Smart Street Lightning system to provide a local navigation service. The positioning part of the system uses Angle of Arrival (AoA) measurements to estimate the vehicle position on the map. Based on a realistic network scenario, extracted from a city map using Google Maps, we study the performance of triangulation using AoA in a smart urban environment that exhibits topology related constraints. Simulations results show that such constraints lead to particular spatial distribution of the anchor nodes that affects both positioning accuracy and beacon packets reception rate. We also propose and evaluate the use of the network communication range as a technique to mitigate the effect of geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). The simulation results show that this technique successfully detected GDOP-affected positions and thus significantly enhanced the positioning accuracy.},

GaitAssist detects freezing episodes from ankle-mounted motion sensors, which stream data via Bluetooth to an Android phone. In response, the system plays a rhythmic auditory sound that adapts to the patient's regular gait speed.

I. e., there is a gap between the site the analysis outcomes occur (the management level) and the site where an immediate reaction to these results is required (the factory shop floor). Even worse, there is no mobile, holistic and analytics-based information provisioning tool for workers and production supervisors on the shop floor but rudimentary systems designed for limited application areas, only. Therefore, we introduce our Mobile Manufacturing Dashboard (MMD), a situation-aware manufacturing dashboard for mobile devices. The MMD provides advanced analytics and addresses the full range of process-oriented information needs of both shop floor workers and production supervisors. In this paper, we give a brief overview of the MMD's major architecture and implementation aspects and describe two representative real-world scenarios for the MMD. These characteristic scenarios target shop floor workers and production supervisors and illustrate situation-aware information provisioning in the smart factory.},

abstract={Modern cities continuously struggle with infrastructural problems especially when the population is massively growing. One affected area is public transportation. In default of offering convenient and reliable service the passengers tend to consider other transport alternatives. However, even a relatively simple functional enhancement, such as providing real-time timetable information, requires considerable investment and effort following traditional means, e.g. deploying sensors and building a background communication and processing infrastructure. Using the power of crowd to gather the required data, share information and send feedback is a viable and cost effective alternative. In this demonstration, we present TrafficInfo, our prototype smart phone application to implement a participatory sensing based live public transport information service. TrafficInfo visualizes the actual position of public transport vehicles with live updates on a map, and gives support to crowd sourced data collection and passenger feedback.},

The system consists of two wearable accelerometers sewn into elastic sports-wear, placed on the abdomen and the right thigh. The recognition of the user's activities and detection of falls is performed on a laptop using the raw sensors' data acquired through Bluetooth. The offline evaluation of the system's performance was conducted on a dataset containing a wide range of activities and different types of falls. The F-measure of the activity recognition and fall detection were 99% and 78%, respectively. Additionally, the system was evaluated at the EvAAL-2013 activity recognition competition and awarded the first place, achieving the score of 83.6%, which was for 14.2 percentage points better than the second-place system.

abstract={Although mobile smart devices are becoming more and more resourceful, they cannot compete with higher-end devices in terms of computational capabilities. Therefore, it is generally advantageous to offload computationally intensive tasks. While cloud-based offloading is popular, it has a non-negligible impact on the energy consumption of mobile devices. Our solution is a novel approach based on locally opportunistic code offloading that leverages the local availability of higher-end devices. We aim to demonstrate the benefits of our approach with respect to a widely adopted benchmark: face recognition.},

abstract={A smartphone is a personal device and as such usually hosts multiple public user identities such as a phone number, email address, and Facebook account. As each smartphone has a unique Bluetooth MAC address, Bluetooth discovery can be used in combination with the user registration to a server with a Facebook account. This makes it possible to identify a nearby smartphone related to a given Facebook contact. Using this capability, we designed Memorit, an application that handles reminders alerting the user when a contact is nearby her/him. This way it is possible to trigger a user-defined reminder, for example to give back a book, when a registered contact comes in proximity. Data collected from Memorit will allow study of pervasive social context. This paper gives an overview of Memorit, its features, implementation, and evaluates its applicability through a user study.},

pages={154-156}, 
abstract={Temperature strongly affects the operation of integrated circuits, and its impact has been largely investigated on a device level. However, the impact of temperature variations on networks of multiple devices is far less understood and requires investigation. We aim to close this gap and analyse the impact of temperature fluctuations on low-power wireless sensor networks, a key enabling technology of pervasive computing. As we are moving forward into an era of human-centric safety-critical applications (e.g., smart health and intelligent transportation systems), it is particularly important to make sure that a networked system offers a reliable and deterministic performance despite all possible temperature changes over its deployment lifetime. In this demo, we present a testbed infrastructure based on infra-red heating lamps that allows to vary the on-board temperature of sensor nodes on a large scale in a repeatable fashion. Using this experimental infrastructure, we show the effects of temperature variations on network performance in two different ways. First, in a small-scale local testbed at PerCom, we highlight the degradation of the wireless link quality at high temperatures, and show that the performance of radio transceivers is temperature-dependent. We quantify this degradation and parametrize the dependency between temperature and link quality using the signal strength information captured between four wireless sensor nodes. Second, we connect remotely to our large-scale experimental infrastructure at TU Graz, and assess the impact of temperature variations on the performance of state-of-the-art network protocols, showing that the typical outdoor temperature fluctuations occurring during 24-hours do affect key network metrics such as throughput, delay, and lifetime.},

abstract={This paper showcases MadApp, an application-level development framework that supports the expressive development and flexible deployment of applications for web applications in delay-tolerant networks. MadApp allows web applications to be developed in two pieces. First, a static piece that contains unchanging content can be downloaded from a traditional web server. This static piece may specify “holes” that designate places in which dynamically collected content can be integrated into the web application as this content is opportunistically collected from the pervasive computing environment. MadApp supports both the development of these web applications by making is easy to specify this missing content and how it is dynamically integrated and the deployment of the web applications by providing middleware support for collecting and integrating content on the fly. This demonstration showcases how MadApp can be used to support such opportunistic web applications through a webpage integrated with the demonstration event itself. Users will be able to download a web page that contains a static map and a listing of the demonstrations. As users move through the demonstration space, they can generate content, e.g., photos of demonstrations, which their app will then share opportunistically with others in the exhibition space.},

abstract={Using Peer-to-Peer technology to deliver live video streams to mobile devices is a promising approach. It allows service providers to scale their video distribution without increasing their cost. As the resources are replicated at the edge of the network, mobile devices can take advantage of close-by peers in order to get the required data faster. This, however, is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the participating mobile devices. Hence, the video distribution overlay needs to adapt quickly to changes in the available bandwidth as well as the location of peers. Also, it should be resilient to arbitrary disconnects as well as targeted attacks. In this paper, we introduce a multi-tree-push streaming system which takes the upload capacities of mobile devices into account and arranges the overlay connections based on their position in the network topology. Our demonstrations show that our system is resilient to churn and attacks while running on desktop machines and mobile devices.},

We are able to satisfy complex demands using only first-order logic, which makes this system flexible yet fast. The focus of this paper is to demonstrate how to achieve high usability of the proposed system without burdening users with the underlying semantic technologies.

volume={},

pages={168-170}, 
abstract={Hidden patterns and contexts play an important part in intelligent pervasive systems. Most of the existing works have focused on simple forms of contexts derived directly from raw signals. High-level constructs and patterns have been largely neglected or remained under-explored in pervasive computing, mainly due to the growing complexity over time and the lack of efficient principal methods to extract them. Traditional parametric modeling approaches from machine learning find it difficult to discover new, unseen patterns and contexts arising from continuous growth of data streams due to its practice of training-then-prediction paradigm. In this work, we propose to apply Bayesian nonparametric models as a systematic and rigorous paradigm to continuously learn hidden patterns and contexts from raw social signals to provide basic building blocks for context-aware applications. Bayesian nonparametric models allow the model complexity to grow with data, fitting naturally to several problems encountered in pervasive computing. Under this framework, we use nonparametric prior distributions to model the data generative process, which helps towards learning the number of latent patterns automatically, adapting to changes in data and discovering never-seen-before patterns, contexts and activities. The proposed methods are agnostic to data types, however our work shall demonstrate to two types of signals: accelerometer activity data and Bluetooth proximal data.},

abstract={The construction of indoor floor plans for wireless localization with minimal deployment effort and with low cost is relevant in many ambient intelligence and mobile computing applications. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a well-known technique for solving the problem of localization of an object in an unknown environment while simultaneously constructing a map of the surrounding area. A majority of previous indoor mapping methods in SLAM use odometry measurement with exteroceptive sensing to simultaneously estimate user position and construct a map of the environment. Inertial navigation is used in SLAM by constantly monitoring heading changes and distance traveled by means of inertial sensors. This offers slow convergence of floor plan construction and generates large errors due to the relative lack of indoor position landmarks. The goal of the present thesis is to explore the wall penetration loss effect of wireless signals in order to construct a floor map using Received Signal Strength (RSS) readings from moving smartphones. A method by which to construct indoor maps at low cost and with fast convergence without the need to collect the odometry data of the user.},

abstract={The richness of user-centric information gathered by modern devices can be used to keep track of memorable events, therefore acting as a prosthesis of the prone-to-forget human memory. We propose to combine virtual and physical sensors from mobile devices to infer digital memories of user activities in a semi-supervised fashion. In MemorySense, sensor data is processed by a space and energy efficient algorithm to recognize basic activities. We then use semantic reasoning to aggregate these activities into the digital equivalent of a human episodic memory.},

pages={199-202}, 
abstract={A common problem in large urban cities is the huge number of retail options available. In response, a number of shopping assistance applications have been created for mobile phones. However, these applications mostly allow users to know where stores are or find promotions on specific items. What is missing is a system that factors in a user's shopping preferences and automatically tells them which stores are of their interest. A key challenge in this system is building a matching algorithm that can combine user preferences with fairly unstructured deals and store information to generate a final rank ordered list. In this work, we present the first prototype of my Deal, a system that automatically ranks deals according to user preferences and presents them to the user on their mobile device.},

Contrary to existing approaches, our solution aims at optimizing the lifetime of every battery-operated devices that may contribute to the activity recognition, including sensors but also smart phones or tablets. Depending on the environment opportunities, our approach balance the load among multiple base stations (mobile phone, tablet, laptop) and when beneficial, enables the energy-limited base stations and/or sensors to offload a part of their tasks to back-end servers.

abstract={The resource constrained characteristic of M2M systems has made secure channel establishment for sensor data communication a challenging task. While the proposed Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) from Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) enables lightweight application layer for sensor devices and gateways, lightweight security protocol on DTLS-secured CoAP (CoAPs) is still not optimally achieved. CoAPs proposes different modes of security starting from pre-shared key to certificate mode. This paper investigates the performance of the payload embedded novel authentication and key management mechanism proposed by the authors, which is robust in nature, compared to pre-shared key mode CoAPs, as well as lightweight. The proposed scheme can be integrated in future with pre-shared key mode of DTLS to reinforce DTLS for mutual authentication. We prove efficacy of our proposed scheme based on comparative analysis with pre-shared key mode of CoAPs.},

pages={220-223}, 
abstract={Processes allow the high-level description and execution of service call sequences among multiple devices. Pervasive systems created the need for decentralized and resource-saving process execution environments due to a lack of central high-powered servers for process orchestration. Ubiquitous systems add the aspect of loosely-coupled mobile devices and the strong focus on the user to the list of challenges that need to be handled when executing processes. Current process engines, however, are not able to handle these new requirements regarding scalability, dynamics, and user interactions sufficiently. In this work in progress, we propose a hierarchical peer-to-peer architecture for a distributed process execution environment. The proposed system is able to cope with the dynamics and scalability demands of ubiquitous systems and allows for more resilient processes. In addition, the devices involved in the processes provide the user with means for interaction with the process execution. We will discuss the approach and the application of suitable algorithms to improve its efficiency and the utilization of available resources.},

abstract={This paper introduces a work in progress, where we intend to investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online Supervised Learning (SL) to achieve energy optimization in District-Heating (DH) systems. We believe RL is an ideal approach since this task falls under the control-optimization problem where RL has yielded optimal results in previous work. The magnitude and scale of a DH system complexity incurs the curse of dimensionalities and model, hereby making RL a good choice since it provides a solution for the problem. To assist RL even further with the curse of dimensionalities, we intend to investigate the use of SL to reduce the state space. To achieve this, we shall use historical data to generate a heat load sub-model for each home. We believe using the output of these sub-models as feedback to the RL algorithm could significantly reduce the complexity of the learning task. Also, it could reduce convergence time for the RL algorithm. The desired goal is to achieve a realtime application, which takes operational actions when it receives new direct feedback. However, considering the dynamics of DH system such as large time delay and dissipation in DH network due to various factors, we hope to investigate things such as the appropriate data sampling rate and new parameters / sensors that could improve knowledge about the state of the system, especially on the consumer side of the DH network.},

abstract={Participatory sensing, which appropriates wearable devices such as mobile phones to enable ad-hoc, person-centric mobile sensing networks, has the potential of delivering datasets with high spatio-temporal granularity. We argue that to obtain such datasets the concept of a participatory campaign, a recipe for gathering data to answer a particular concern, is essential, and that technological support for organising such campaigns is currently lacking. Campaign support is crucial to ensure that a dataset of adequate quality is gathered to study the concern under consideration, and additionally, to empower communities by providing them with a tool to answer local concerns and set up grassroots sensing actions without having to wait for an institutionalised action to take place. In this article we present a proof-of-concept architecture for participatory campaigns. The latter is built upon a formal definition of a campaign and the description of a campaign lifecycle, both of which are distilled out of earlier expertise with and related work on organising participatory sensing campaigns.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Contemporary smartphones are capable of providing rich and detailed information about human mobility. The localization capabilities of the devices enable us to obtain information about the places people visit and the routes they take, whereas other sensing capabilities can provide information, e.g., about the people they travel with and the transportation means they use. Typically, the more detailed the information the mobility monitoring provides, the higher its energy cost is, making the design of energy-efficient mechanisms for monitoring human mobility an important challenge. This talk consists of two parts. In the first part, we introduce some of our previous work on energy-efficient monitoring of different facets of human mobility. These include energy-efficient designs for monitoring user position, trajectories, and transportation modes. In the second part of the talk, we discuss the interrelationships between different energy-efficient monitoring mechanisms and the resulting accuracy of the mobility monitoring. Specifically, we demonstrate how designs focused on reducing the energy cost of monitoring a specific aspect of mobility can significantly decrease the accuracy of the monitoring of other aspects. Based on our discussion, we conclude by arguing for a need for comprehensive designs to mobility monitoring that simultaneously addresses different aspects of human mobility.},

abstract={In this work we examine a large dataset of 335 million anonymized call records made by 3 million users during 47 days in a region of northern Italy. Combining this dataset with publicly available user data, from different social networking ser-vices, we present a probabilistic approach to evaluate the potential of re-identification of the anonymized call records dataset. In this sense, our work explores different ways of analyzing data and data fusion techniques to integrate different mobility datasets together. On the one hand, this kind of approaches can breach users' privacy despite anonymization, so it is worth studying carefully. On the other hand, combining different datasets is a key enabler for advanced context-awareness in that information form multiple sources can complement and enrich each other.},

year={2014},

pages={243-248}, 
abstract={In a pervasive networking scenario like the Cyber-Physical World convergence, personal mobile devices must assist their users in analysing data available in both the physical and the virtual world, to help them discovering the features of the environment where they move. Mobile Social Networking applications are an example of Cyber-Physical applications, supporting users in their interactions in both worlds (e.g., during physical encounters, as well as during online interactions). It is very important, therefore, that nodes autonomously detect latent and dynamically changing social structures, resulting from common mobility patterns of users and physical co-location events. To this end, in this paper we propose a novel dynamic and decentralised community detection approach, whereby the nodes' behaviour is inspired by that of their human users, if they were exposed to the about physical encounters with other users, and would have to perform the same detection task. Specifically, we use cognitive heuristics, which are simple, low resource-demanding, yet effective, models of the human brain cognitive processes. At each node, the approach proposed in this paper, starting from the observed contact patterns with other nodes, estimates the strength of social relationships and detects social communities accordingly. An initial simulation evaluation shows that nodes are able to correctly identify the social communities that exist in their environment and to efficiently track change of membership due to modifications of the users' movement patterns.},

abstract={Human mobility knowledge is key for urban planning or mobility models design. Therefore, estimating reliable mobility parameters is crucial to lay an unbiased foundation. However, most works estimating such features rely on datasets made up of the history of mobile network cells where the user is located when she makes active use of the network, known as Call Data Records (CDRs), or every time the her device connects to a new cell, without taking into account cell changes not caused by movement. Could we accurately characterize human mobility with such datasets? In this work we consider three approaches to collect network-based mobility data, propose three filtering techniques to delete cell changes not caused by movement and compare mobility features extracted from the traces collected with each approach. The analysis unveils the need for a filtering step to avoid important biases, and the negative impact that using CDRs may have in estimating mobility parameters.},

pages={260-265}, 
abstract={Our era of increased people mobility requires a better understanding of how people move, how many are the places that a person commonly visits, how people move among them. In our previous work we have shown that the number of visited points of interest (PoIs) of each person is regulated by some laws that are statistically similar among individuals, and we gave some classification of them in terms of their relevance. We investigate here the variables that characterize the way humans move among PoIs, and in particular the spatial and temporal distances between PoIs and the PoIs relevance. With this respect, most of the existing work on mobility, especially on its modeling, is based only on spatial distance, while we argue here that for human mobility the temporal distance and the PoIs relevance are essential factors. Also, by comparing the geographical and temporal distances between consecutive PoIs, we observe a smoother and more linear trend in the temporal case. The results suggest that the time, rather than physical distance, could represent a better measure of distance among PoIs, mainly due to the transportation facilities. We present here our analysis of this aspect, considering two different datasets, to show the validity of our results independently of the nature of the dataset under consideration, and to extract considerations on different scenario scales. We argue that these results can be seminal to novel mobility research.},

Additionally other irregularities in these traces are also exposed. The possible impact of these irregularities is evaluated in one specific application, Proximity Maps.

We consider an environment where stationary objects generate temporal data and peers issue location-dependent range queries. We evaluate this framework by varying the constraints of range queries and measure their effect on three metrics: percentage of queries satisfied, fraction of data received and query response time. From our simulations, we make two key observations: the range query constraints have no impact on the performance metrics beyond a certain threshold and the temporal nature of data drastically limits the mobility benefits (traditionally exploited by mobile P2P query systems). We also present scenarios where a mobile P2P query processing framework can be used to satisfy location-dependent range queries.},

abstract={Summary form only given. ChaosFIRE is an experiment project to evaluate the performance and usability of peer-to-peer mobile technologies as an alternative mean to central service based solutions to collect and distribute sensor information in an urban area. The Project runs under the 1st Open Call of Fed4FIRE IP under FP7 and is based on the technology developed in the Chaoster project of MTA SZTAKI DSD. Chaoster is a DTN-PSN (Delay Tolerant Networking - Pocket Switched Network) based adaptive, context-aware collaboration platform supporting emergent interoperability for crisis/chaos management. DTN-PSN communication layer of Chaoster is used in this experiment together with the ChaosONE simulator, for the evaluation of DTN communication protocols. This talk will present the Chaoster platform, the target use cases of the solution and the aims and results of the ChaosFIRE experiment.},

abstract={The advanced sensors embedded in modern smartphones opens up for novel research opportunities, as for instance manifested in the field of mobile phone sensing. Most notable is perhaps research activities within human activity recognition and context-aware applications. Along a similar vein, the SmartRescue project targets monitoring of both hazard developments as well as tracking of people in a disaster, taking advantage of smartphone sensing, processing and communication capabilities. The goal is to help crisis managers and the public in early hazard detection, hazard prediction, and in the forming of risk minimizing evacuation plans when disaster strikes. In this paper we propose a novel smartphone based communication framework for disaster specific machine learning techniques that intelligently process sensor readings into useful information for the crisis responders. Core to the framework is a robust content-based publish-subscribe mechanism that allows flexible sharing of sensor data and computation results. The proposed communication platform has been tested at the proof of concept level, with several detailed features providing promising results. We also provide the initial results from the development of this platform and discuss how to enhance the platform to become a disaster monitoring system for practical use.},

abstract={Detecting disruptive events using Commercial off-the-self (COTS) sensors like the ones embedded in smartphones is a difficult challenge but also an interesting opportunity. In this paper, we present a reliable and scalable hierarchical architecture of smartphones acting as opportunistic sensor nodes. Using a low energy-consumption application, we have used the smartphones inertial sensor as an accelerograph. The deployed smartphones and the application form a low-cost wireless sensor network, that detects, analyzes and notifies a seismic-peak. The systems optimizes the distributed calculations in the smartphones; communication capabilities and integration in order to provide extra time for early warning in disaster scenarios (e.g. earthquakes), although the architecture may be extended to other disruptive and rare events. We propose an innovative real-time solution which considers time and spatial analyzes, not present in another works, making it more precise and customizable, coupling it to the features of the geographical zone, network and resources, so as providing evidence of the feasibility of earthquake early warning using a dense network of cell phones. The architecture has been validated by extensive evaluation and the most relevant result has been the improvement in notifications delivery about a seismic-peak 12 seconds earlier than previous works in the epicenter zone, and a reduction in the number of false positives. Additionally the proposed architecture includes a post-event management to help users and strengthen coordination between aid-agencies in order to optimize human resources and time to implement measures in order to eliminate negative effects on the population.},

abstract={The literature of wireless adhoc networks includes a plethora of alternative dissemination strategies that aim for efficient delivery of data traffic from source to destination. Hence, the majority of these strategies assume that the source-destination pair is known prior to any data forwarding. On the contrary, an adhoc network opportunistically formed by mobile devices in the aftermath of a disaster, lacks any actual knowledge with respect to the network topology and the response units' availability. As such, distress nodes need to first understand their topological status in order to then be able to make informed forwarding decisions for alert message dissemination. The Explore and Exploit strategy, described hereafter, is purposefully envisioned to solve the latter issues and meet the stringent requirements for highly efficient data dissemination.},

pages={308-313}, 
abstract={When a catastrophic natural disaster occurs, the efficiency of disaster response is crucial to life saving. However, mobile communication systems usually crashed due to various causes, making the coordination among a large number of disorganized disaster response workers extremely difficult. We propose a Contingency Cellular Network (CCN) by connecting disconnected base stations together with wireless links and portable power generators. Since the transportation capacity may be very limited, scheduling of CCN deployment order according to the demand of disaster response becomes an important issue. Two models aiming to maximize disaster response efficiency are proposed in this research. Emergency levels of disaster areas, time decreasing profit functions, traveling time of delivery path, and antecessor precedence constraint are taken into consideration in the CCNDS-AC model. The second model, CCNDS-UC is the same but with antecessor precedence constraint relaxed. Both problems are proven NP complete. Two heuristic but efficient algorithms are designed to solve the problems. Both algorithms can outperform our previous algorithm by a significant margin in our simulation experiments. This shows that the traveling time is a significant factor in designing an effective CCN deployment scheduling problem.},

pages={314-319}, 
abstract={Emergency management systems are Cyber-Physical-Human Systems (CPHS) that use sensing, together with communications and control, to guide humans and physical systems such as vehicles, towards safe desirable outcomes in the shortest possible time. When human health and safety, and lives also, are at stake, it is important to take decisions in real-time with the best possible use of resources, including the critical resource of emergency personnel. Such distributed decision problems are so complex that the resulting optimisation and allocation problems can only be handled in a fast and timely manner using efficient heuristics. Thus in this paper we apply a recent resource allocation algorithm based on the Random Neural Network (RNN) to allocate rescuers to those evacuees whose health level has deteriorated beyond a certain level in the course of an evacuation. The approach is evaluated by simulating the evacuation of a three story building using the Distributed Building Evacuation Simulator (DBES) developed at Imperial College. The simulations show that the outcome of the evacuation can be significantly improved in this manner, in particular for larger numbers of evacuees.},

abstract={Indoor navigation in emergency scenarios poses a challenge to evacuation and emergency support, especially for injured or physically encumbered individuals. Navigation systems must be lightweight, easy to use, and provide robust localization and accurate navigation instructions in adverse conditions. To address this challenge, we combine magnetic location tracking with an optical character recognition (OCR) and eye gaze based method to recognize door plates and position related text to provide more robust localization. In contrast to typical wireless or sensor based tracking, our fused system can be used in low-lighting, smoke, and areas without power or wireless connectivity. Eye gaze tracking is also used to improve time to localization and accuracy of the OCR algorithm. Once localized, navigation instructions are transmitted directly into the user's immediate field of view via head mounted display (HMD). Additionally, setting up the system is simple and can be done with minimal calibration, requiring only a walk-through of the environment and numerical annotation of a 2D area map. We conduct an evaluation for the magnetic and OCR systems individually to evaluate feasibility for use in the fused framework.},

abstract={Vehicle localization systems rely on measuring distances between a given target and a set of reference points. The accuracy of a localization system strictly depends on the exactness of these measurements. However, the estimation of distances via wireless signals is affected by errors due to factors such as channel noise and multipath propagation. Precise localization is very important for emergency management, especially in tunnels where accidents such as fire typically cause more damage due to difficult evacuation. In this paper we analysed the characteristics of time of flight based ranging in tunnel environment from the error stand point with the aim of designing an error compensation unit. We integrated such a compensation unit within an existing vehicle localization system to improve the localization accuracy. We designed and validated our solution by performing real experiments in a tunnel located in Lugano, Switzerland.},

abstract={Static evacuation plans for buildings are generally designed to perform optimally when the building is at full capacity. We present a dynamic evacuation guidance system which does this regardless of the number of evacuees, by tailoring a flow-optimal evacuation plan to the current situation. The system assigns routes using a capacity-constrained routing algorithm which anticipates evolutions in path metrics using the concept of “future capacity reservation”. In order to direct evacuees in an intuitive manner whilst implementing the routing algorithm's scheme, we use dynamic exit signs, i.e. whose pointing direction can be controlled. Yet our routing algorithm performs source-routing on a “per-evacuee” basis and would normally mandate one display per evacuee. We therefore propose a novel algorithm which schedules the dynamic signs according to the algorithm's output. We validate this concept using simulations, and show how the underpinning assumptions may limit the system's performance, especially in low-headcount evacuations.},

abstract={Responding to an emergency situation is a challenging and time critical procedure. The primary goal is to save lives and this is directly related to the speed and efficiency at which help is provided to the victims. Rescue robots are able to benefit an emergency response procedure by searching for survivors, providing access to inaccessible areas and establishing an on-site communication network. This paper investigates how a cyber attack on a rescue robot can adversely affect its operation and impair an emergency response operation. The focus is on identifying physical indicators of an ongoing cyber attack, which can help to design more efficient detection and defense mechanisms. A number of experiments have been conducted on an Arduino based robot, under different cyber attack scenarios. The results show that the cyber attack's effects have physical features that can be used in order to improve the robot's robustness against this type of threat.},

abstract={The landscape of business and leisure travel has been forever changed by the convergence of such factors as dwindling natural resources, oversubscribed and blurred personal versus professional time commitments, and burgeoning expenses. The hotel industry has been seemingly slow to adjust key aspects of their core business model to take into account to these weighty forces. In the 21st century, these traditional business models of the hospitality industry are no longer simply disrupted by emerging technologies; but now, these disruptive forces carry with them the power to decimate. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new model for the industry to consider. Though not yet validated, the model is technologically rooted in pervasive connectivity and economically based on sustainable development and operational practices. There are two critical aspects of model: 1.) There is a confederated and distributed approach to technological and economic ownership of the service delivery platforms and 2.) Sustainability is a core driver as opposed to an afterthought (e.g. resulting “tax” benefits of initiatives). The authors propose that this synergistic approach may help to ensure the timely adoption of a broad range of pervasive connectivity services to embrace to achieve sustainable development practices for economic and operational advantages.},

pages={382-387}, 
abstract={Food waste has received little attention in pervasive computing. In this paper we discuss previous work which stresses the need for understanding how intelligent technology could prevent food waste in households. We present EUPHORIA, a community based social system that can track users' food waste potential and redirect behavior, through social influence strategies, towards more sustainable food related practices. To promote social interaction, the system recommends social recipes based on available food from different users to prevent waste as well as to provide a new pleasurable experience around food. A mobile application will be developed in three phases. In the first phase, the application allow users to log and track food waste related behavior patterns. Next, it will provide eco-feedback and social visibility of own and other users' food related behavior. Finally, a social recipe recommendation will be implemented. Findings are expected to provide a better understanding of consumers' social behavior around food waste.},

abstract={Pervasive computing systems raise unprecedented challenges to citizen privacy. They fundamentally skew the relationship between our public and private selves, conflating the two in ever-changing and unanticipated ways. Within this context, the act of consenting is a critical mechanism of empowerment, allowing us to protect those aspects of our lives we wish to retain as private. Whilst designers of such systems are uniquely positioned to create mechanisms that embed consent-supporting practices, this is not a current priority. This pilot study employs two small focus groups to explore the utility of a series of consent `guidelines' with designers of pervasive systems. It finds that, whilst user consent is clearly valued, there exists a discord between participants' intention/belief and their practice, raising serious questions as to the extent to which purely `ethical' guidelines can ever gain traction at the point of design.},

pages={394-394}, 
abstract={Can inexpensive accelerometers, such as those in cell phones and other commodity devices, be used for earthquake detection and monitoring? Detecting rare, disruptive events using community-held sensors is a promising opportunity, but also presents difficult challenges. Rare events are often difficult or impossible to model and characterize a priori, yet we wish to maximize detection performance. Further, heterogeneous, community-operated sensors may differ widely in quality and communication constraints. We present a principled approach towards detecting rare events that learns sensor-specific decision thresholds online, in a distributed way. We perform aggregation by sparsification: roughly, a sparsifying basis is a linear transformation that aggregates measurements from groups of sensors that tend to co-activate, and each event is observed by only a few groups of sensors. We show how a simple class of sparsifying bases provably improves detection with noisy binary sensors, even when only qualitative information about the network is available. We then describe how detection can be further improved by learning a better sparsifying basis from network observations or simulations. We present an implementation of our approach in the Community Seismic Network (CSN), a community sensing system with the goal of rapidly detecting earthquakes using cell phone accelerometers, consumer USB devices and cloud-computing based sensor fusion. We experimentally evaluate our approach based on a pilot deployment of the CSN system. Our results, including data from shake table experiments, provide evidence towards the feasibility of rapid earthquake detection using a dense network of cell phones.},

pages={395-400}, 
abstract={The explosive growth in social networks that publish real-time content begs the question of whether their feeds can complement traditional sensors to achieve augmented sensing capabilities. One such capability is to explain anomalous sensor readings. Towards that end, in this paper, we build an automated anomaly clarification service, called ClariSense. It explains sensor anomalies using social network feeds. Explanation goes beyond detection. When a sensor network detects anomalous conditions, our system automatically suggests hypotheses that explain the likely causes of the anomaly to a human by identifying unusual social network feeds that seem to be correlated with the sensor anomaly in time and in space. To evaluate this service, we use real-time data feeds from the California traffic system that shares vehicle count and traffic speed on major California highways at 5 minute intervals. When anomalies are detected, our system automatically diagnoses their root cause by correlating the anomaly with feeds on Twitter. The identified cause is then compared to official traffic and incident reports, showing a great correspondence with ground truth.},

year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={401-406}, 
abstract={Routers are often faced with a variety of users throughout a day. These users make requests, of which the most bandwidth consuming and least delay tolerant are requests for internet content including videos. To save cost of uploading all requested data, routers use content-aware caching schemes. The efficiency of such schemes is dependent on router ability to predict the use of the currently requested content. At the same time, research on social networks indicates that users with social ties have the correlated mobility patterns and the correlated interests in requested content. In this paper, we demonstrate that these correlations between mobility and between interests can be used to improve efficiency of content-based caching network caching by taking into account social ties between users visiting a router. To this end, we built a model for router visits and user demand based on social relations. We then used this model to create a content-aware caching scheme called “SOcial Content Caching Scheme (SOCCS)“. Our results demonstrate that by using information about frequency of visit by members of different social communities combined with topic tags on the content requested by each community, the performance of routers can be increased remarkably compared to their performance with random caching. Moreover, such socially based caching is robust to changes in many parameters of our model that affect visits by mobile nodes, the tags of content that they request, and how history is incorporated into caching decisions.},

abstract={The pervasive availability of personal devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, and in-car navigation systems combined with the widespread acceptance of social networks has resulted in an explosion of data about individuals and their interactions in the society. The presence of multiple social networks such as FaceBook, Twitter, and Google Plus results in fragmentation of an individual's online presence. As such, the notion of interacting multiple networks or composite networks is gaining popularity. In this paper, we present a first-of-a-kind framework to analyze such composite networks in an efficient and scalable manner. We propose to use the BSP programming model to analyze composite networks and show the inportance of analyzing such composite networks as opposed to individual networks separately through preliminary experiments on realworld data.},

abstract={Tasklets provide means for lightweight distributed computing. Based on virtual machines, they allow to utilize excess capacity in cloud computing as well as integrate cloud resources into mobile computing. So far, the Tasklets architecture only provides a best-effort computing abstraction while using direct addressing of peers. However, a higher level of service is often desirable, as is found in other technologies for distributed computing. For example, in the Internet protocol suite, the Transport layer provides the choice of reliable or unreliable communication on top of the best-effort Internet layer. In middle-ware technology, distribution transparency masks where a specific service is located. Similar guarantees and abstractions in other systems are achieved via Quality of Service (QoS) parameters and mechanisms. In this paper, we discuss QoS categories for Tasklets, develop the necessary system extensions for QoS integration, and present a QoS-based Tasklet trading system. We evaluate our approach in a prototype system by trading Tasklets of two different prioritization levels.},

abstract={This paper investigates the potential of improving the Quality of Experience (QoE) of pervasive video delivery by buffering. It reveals the importance of delivering video without freezes to the end user. It then introduces a fluid flow model that leads to a closed formula for the freeze probability, and matches measured distributions of on- and off-times to this model's exponential distributions in order to underline its feasibility. The closed formula for the freeze probability is then used to investigate the impact of two buffer size adaptation policies, one additive and one multiplicative with regards to the deviation of the average off-time from its nominal value. It is proven that, besides of some specific conditions in the additive case, the freeze probability grows with the disturbance, which means that even an increased buffer size implies worse performance and thus QoE. It also points out a way out of this dilemma, which is to try to reduce off times by reducing the utilization of the mobile link.},

abstract={Conventional performance criteria for communication networks do not take into account the semantics of the data to be communicated. For example, (word) error rates treat errors between semantically similar words (car and automobile) and semantically distant words (car and computer) equally. In reality, the meaning of the message is distorted much less when automobile is recovered instead of computer when the intended message is car. In order to correctly address the performance of a semantic system, a new performance criterion is necessary that takes into account the semantic similarities between recovered words. We study in this paper the index assignment problem with a source that produces semantic messages to develop a better understanding of how their meanings affect the semantic error performance in a noisy communication network, and in particular for networks with queries. To this end, we utilize the semantic distances based on lexical taxonomies as a distortion measure in a communication system. Our findings indicate the need for development of semantics-aware physical systems that allow for better integration of human factors and intelligence within complex systems design.},

However, the quality of those sensor observations are influenced by different factors including the physical or chemical principle of measurement, the internal processing of the sensing device, and the prevailing environmental conditions at the time of measurement. Thus, it is of great interest to not just measure and process the sensor observation but to also handle the quality of the sensor observation correctly and propagate the quality of the observation along the processing path to the user. To do so, we use the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN) to combine necessary sensor observations from multiple sources in a Probabilistic Data Stream Management System (PDSMS) to estimate prevailing conditions and propagate current quality information.},

The suggested implementation allows for uniting all heterogeneous networked resources with the gateway and publishes semantic enhancement of the cues being triggered by network resources to be processed in a meaningful way by applications responsible for autonomic management and control of home ecosystem. The fundamental building blocks of middleware framework includes (i) a communication middleware that aims for disguising the networked infrastructure heterogeneity, and for facilitating auto-commissioning or auto-registration of disparate resources (sensors, actuators, appliances, meters etc.) (ii) a semantic middleware built on unified ontological model for semantic uplifting of networked resource descriptions and measurements with metadata (i.e., resource capabilities, observed phenomena, spatial properties, etc.) with reasoning ability to deduce temporal situations in home environment at high-level abstraction. These inferred situations are subsequently exposed to an array of applications agents.

As queries can be spatial, temporal and thematic in nature, so providing relevant output to each category of queries requires proper understanding of the semantics of the data. Sensor ontologies and their data representation are in place to help understand the semantic to certain extent.

This uses a phase-functionality rule file which binds phases of the workflow to functionalities.

During the third step, the engine executes the generated service calls and pushes the resource it acted on to the next phase in the workflow using a phase-transition rule file.

Integrating pervasive systems with social media can enhance the users' experience and enable them to form pervasive communities with others that share similar interests, habits, profile, behaviour, to communicate and interact with them, to socialise and to share their resources in a seamless manner. But to be able to couple the advantages of pervasive computing and social networking, the wealth of user context information available needs to be properly processed, managed and exploited. This imposes several critical requirements regarding reliable context learning and reasoning facilities. This paper presents a multi-user context inference mechanism that is based on Neural Networks and aims to exploit the knowledge available at community level.

A classic MP2P trust scheme usually requires high amount of data transaction in order to identify the trustworthiness of service/content providers. This paper proposes a lightweight trustworthy service discovery scheme for service-oriented MSNP. The evaluation results show that the proposed schemes can reduce the overall transaction cost and are equally reliable to the basic schemes which require large number of reputation rating data.},

abstract={The aim of pervasive system technology is to support the user in managing and interacting with devices in the environment around him/her. By contrast social networking systems are aimed at supporting communication and interactions between people. The major objective of the SOCIETIES project is to unite these two technologies in a seamless manner to create a platform that enables the user to interact with both devices and people in an integrated way. Such a platform, referred to as a Pervasive Social Networking System, needs to integrate the pervasive computing technologies from the user's physical spaces with social computing technologies in the user's digital spaces. An important aspect of the SOCIETIES platform is its ability to adapt its behaviour to meet the individual needs and preferences of the user. This paper focuses on some key aspects of the design of the personalization subsystem of the platform: the extraction of personalization information from digital and physical spaces, the use of this to adapt these spaces autonomously and the extension to include community information to provide additional benefit to the user. Development of the basic platform together with a set of third party services running on it is complete and the system is currently being evaluated in a real user trial by a group of University students.},

abstract={This position paper introduces and discusses Social Object Labels, small pervasive displays for ubiquitous social object annotation. Taking an HCI perspective, it relates user experience problems with ubiquitous annotation described in the literature to a lack of dynamic information available to users and argues that small pervasive displays can address these problems by providing dynamic situated information that supports users before, during and after interaction. The paper describes three potential application domains for ubiquitous social object annotation and presents related scenarios to illustrate possible uses and interactions in concrete terms. It defines the design space for Social Object Labels with reference to related display concepts such as ambient displays and interactive public displays, and structures the defined space by discussing salient design aspects. The paper concludes with a summary and outlook on future research.},

pages={495-499}, 
abstract={Today's digital signage systems typically show content that has been scheduled well in advance by their respective owners. However, we envision that displays in our environment will soon be able to dynamically adapt to their surroundings and allow viewers as well as display owners to appropriate them by actively selecting and contributing content through interactive public display applications. Such multi-user and multi-application display environments require new forms of application and content scheduling that go beyond a predefined sequence of content. In this paper we present a scheduling framework for public displays, adapted from general scheduling theory, as a common notation that can be used to describe different application and content presentation requirements posed by both display owners and display viewers and define the overall behavior of public displays.},

In particular, we expect applications that support user-generated content to rapidly gain importance, since they provide a tangible benefit for the user in the form of digital bulletin boards, discussion platform that foster public engagement, and applications that allow for self-expression. At the same time, such applications infer several challenges: first, they need to provide suitable means for the passerby to contribute content to the application; second, mechanisms need to be employed that provide sufficient control for the display owner with regard to content moderation; and third, the users' expectations with regard to the posting procedure needs to be well understood.

The existing technologies tend to not work reliably through double-glazing and in outdoors conditions. This paper introduces an easy-to-implement, inexpensive solution, which is using light sensors to detect human actions and to interact with a computer. Light-Keypad can be used on any transparent medium, including through thick, coated double-glazing.

They came to the conclusion that distance matters and that the analysed technology is not mature enough to enable virtual co-location. Olson and Olson stated that even future technology will struggle to enable virtual co-location, as providing awareness among co-workers and enabling co-reference as well as spatial referencing will remain a challenge. The keynote explores the concept of virtual co-location. It discuss several scenarios from current and upcoming projects for the application of virtual co-location. These scenarios include among others engineering and construction in the brownfield, remote support and information provision for emergency services, training of experiment procedures and the evaluation of human motor function.},

volume={},

pages={532-538}, 
abstract={With the proliferation of WiFi-enabled devices, people expect to be able to use them everywhere, be it at work, while commuting, or when visiting friends. In the latter case, home owners are confronted with the burden of controlling the access to their WiFi router, and usually resort to simply sharing the password. Although convenient, this solution breaches basic security principles, and puts the burden on the friends who have to enter the password in each and every of their devices. The use of social networks, specifying the trust relations between people and devices, provides for a more secure and more friendly authentication mechanism. In this paper, we progress the state-of-the-art by abandoning the centralized solution to embed social networks in WiFi authentication; we introduce EAP-SocTLS, a decentralized approach for authentication and authorization of WiFi access points and other devices, exploiting the embedded trust relations. In particular, we address the (quadratic) search complexity when indirect trust relations, like the smartphone of a friend's kid, are involved. We show that the simple heuristic of limiting the search to friends and devices in physical proximity makes for a scalable solution. Our prototype implementation, which is based on WebID and EAP-TLS, uses WiFi probe requests to determine the pool of neighboring devices and was shown to reduce the search time from 1 minute for the naive policy down to 11 seconds in the case of granting access over an indirect friend.},

abstract={Online Social Networks (OSNs) usually exploit a logically centralized infrastructure which has several drawbacks including scalability, privacy, and dependence on a provider. In contrast to centralized OSNs, a Distributed Online Social Network helps to lower the cost of the provider drastically, and allows better control of user privacy. A distributed approach introduces new problems to address, as data availability or information diffusion, which require the definition of methods for the analysis of the social graph. This paper focuses the problem of the evaluation of the centrality of a node in a Distributed Online Social Network and proposes a distributed approach for the computation of the Ego Betweenness Centrality, which is an ego-centric method to approximate the Betweenness Centrality. We propose a set of algorithms to compute the betweenness centrality in static and dynamic graphs, which can be directed or undirected. We propose both a broadcast and a gossip protocol to compute the Ego Betweenness Centrality. A set of experimental results proving the effectiveness of our approach are presented.},

abstract={Public displays are important pervasive media in modern cities. Passers-by read information from these displays placed in bus stations, airports, shopping malls, etc. At present, displays are isolated from personal mobile devices. Users can only read information passively, and it is difficult to download any interesting information directly from public displays via personal mobile devices. In contrast, inter-device seamless communication is a trend of the pervasive computing society. In this paper, we explore an effective way to eliminate the borders between pervasive displays and personal mobile devices based on ad hoc wireless communication. We implement a tool which facilitates the process of resource exchange between the two typical pervasive media. Via a pilot study, we demonstrate the advantages of our solution compared with current practices. We believe that this tool could help construct more intelligent pervasive displays or novel social media bringing people together for social activities in the real world.},

abstract={Currently, link recommendation has gained more attention as networked data becomes abundant in several scenarios. However, existing methods for this task have failed in considering solely the structure of dynamic networks for improved performance and accuracy. Hence, in this work, we present a methodology based on the use of multiple topological metrics in order to achieve prospective link recommendations considering time constraints. The combination of such metrics is used as input to binary classification algorithms that state whether two pairs of authors will/should define a link. We experimented with five algorithms, what allowed us to reach high rates of accuracy and to evaluate the different classification paradigms. Our results also demonstrated that time parameters and the activity profile of the authors can significantly influence the recommendation. In the context of DBLP, this research is strategic as it may assist on identifying potential partners, research groups with similar themes, research competition (absence of obvious links), and related work.},

abstract={In this paper we explore the notion of mobile users' similarity as a key enabler of innovative applications hinging on opportunistic mobile encounters. In particular, we analyze the performance of known similarity metrics, applicable to our problem domain, as well as propose a novel temporal-based metric, in an attempt to quantify the inherently qualitative notion of similarity. Towards this objective, we first introduce generalized profile structures, beyond mere location, that aim to capture users interests and prior experiences, in the form of a probability distribution. Afterwards, we analyze known and proposed similarity metrics for the proposed profile structures using publicly available data. Apart from the classic Cosine similarity, we identify a distance metric from probability theory, namely Hellinger distance, as a strong candidate for quantifying similarity due to the probability distribution structure of the proposed profiles. In addition, we introduce a novel temporal similarity metric, based on matrix vectorization, to capitalize on the richness in the temporal dimension and maintain low complexity. Finally, the numerical results unveil a number of key insights. First, the temporal metrics yield, on the average, lower similarity indices, compared to the non-temporal ones, due to incorporating the dynamics in the temporal dimension. Second, the Hellinger distance holds great promise for quantifying similarity between probability distribution profiles. Third, vectorized metrics constitute a low-complexity approach towards temporal similarity on resource-limited mobile devices.},

This amount of information generate a complex and adequate knowledge of one or more specific issues. A possible field of application for Social Sensing is Emergency Management. By using the Social Media it is possible to gather updated information about emerging situations of danger, in order to gain greater situational awareness and to alert interested parties promptly or verify information obtained through other channels. A system able to timely detect events that are of social concern can be referred to as an Early Warning system. In this work we propose a novel and general architecture for an early warning system and, as a proof-of-concept, we describe an implementation of this architecture for a real scenario. We use Twitter as source of information for the detection of earthquakes on the Italian territory. We compare our results with official data provided by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the authority responsible for the monitoring of seismic events in Italy. Results show an high ability of the system in the timely detection of events with magnitude equal or greater than 3.5 Richter with only 10% of False Positives.},

abstract={The research on the efforts of combining human and machine intelligence has a long history. With the development of mobile sensing and mobile Internet techniques, a new sensing paradigm called Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS), which leverages the power of citizens for large-scale sensing has become popular in recent years. As an evolution of participatory sensing, MCS has two unique features: (1) it involves both implicit and explicit participation; (2) MCS collects data from two user-participant data sources: mobile social networks and mobile sensing. This paper presents the literary history of MCS and its unique issues. A reference framework for MCS systems is also proposed. We further clarify the potential fusion of human and machine intelligence in MCS. Finally, we discuss the future research trends as well as our efforts to MCS.},

pages={604-609}, 
abstract={The usage of social networking sites has been steadily increasing in the last decade. Communication via social networks has replaced email as the traditional means of electronic communication in many contexts. Accordingly, many types of Internet fraud also spread to social networks. In this work, we make the first to our knowledge direct comparison of users' susceptibility to attacks that involve clicking on dangerous links in Facebook messages versus in emails. We conducted a between-subjects quasi-experiment with 398 users where the users received links from strangers in a Facebook message or via email. We observed the respective clicking behavior and investigated users' attitudes to URL-based attacks by means of a post-experimental survey. Our results show that the communication medium (Facebook vs. email) leads to significant differences in attack susceptibility. Quite surprisingly, the success rate of email-based attacks is significantly higher.},

year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={610-615}, 
abstract={Social networks allow their users to make their profiles and relationships private. However, in recent years several powerful de-anonymization attacks have been proposed that are able to map corresponding nodes within two seemingly unrelated datasets solely by considering structural information (e.g., crawls of public social networks and datasets published after sanitization). These algorithms consist of two parts: initial selection of seed nodes and then a propagation phase. In related papers, several seeding procedures are proposed, although detailed comparison is often left unexplored, i.e., how one method differs from the others with respect to the overall outcome of the algorithm. In this paper, beside discussing the existing analysis of seeding methods, we experimentally analyze how different seed selection algorithms perform compared to each other, and we highlight significant differences emerging even in the same or in structurally divergent networks.},

abstract={Online social networks' (OSNs) epic popularity has accustomed users to the ease of sharing information. At the same time, OSNs have been a focus of privacy concerns with respect to the information shared. Therefore, it is important that users have some assurance when sharing on OSNs: popular OSNs provide users with mechanisms, to protect shared information access rights. However, these mechanisms do not allow collaboration when defining access rights for joint content related to more than one user (e.g, party pictures in which different users are being tagged). In fact, the access rights list for such content is represented by the union of the access list defined by each related user, which could result in unwanted leakage. We propose a collaborative access control scheme, based on secret sharing, in which sharing of content on OSNs is decided collaboratively by a number of related users. We demonstrate that such mechanism is feasible and benefits users' privacy.},

year={2014},

pages={622-628}, 
abstract={Privacy concerns in online social networking services have prompted a number of proposals for decentralized online social networks (DOSN) that remove the central provider and aim at giving the users control over their data and who can access it. This is usually done by cryptographic means. Existing DOSNs use cryptographic primitives that hide the data but reveal the access policies. At the same time, there are privacy-preserving variants of these cryptographic primitives that do not reveal access policies. They are, however, not suitable for usage in the DOSN context because of performance or storage constraints. A DOSN needs to achieve both privacy and performance to be useful. We analyze predicate encryption (PE) and adapt it to the DOSN context. We propose a univariate polynomial construction for access policies in PE that drastically increases performance of the scheme but leaks some part of the access policy to users with access rights. We utilize Bloom filters as a means of decreasing decryption time and indicate objects that can be decrypted by a particular user. We evaluate the performance of the adapted scheme in the concrete scenario of a news feed. Our PE scheme is best suited for encrypting for groups or small sets of separate identities.},

abstract={Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a well-established security and privacy concept in enterprise environments: Enterprise DLP tools scan outgoing messages and stop unintended information flows. It may catch malicious insiders, but the main use case is avoiding data leaks due to human errors. Good DLP tools prevent careless employees from doing something they would probably regret if made aware of. Individuals using online social networks are in a very similar situation: Often they share the wrong information with the wrong people, unaware of the risks and often even unaware of the technical meaning of what they are doing. Personal DLP, introduced in this paper, extends the notion of DLP to individual users. It makes the individual users aware of risks and mistakes, and it does so based on rules explicitly set by each user, and rules derived from that users' past behavior and individual settings. Personal DLP raises awareness by explaining the risks, but the final decision is always with the user.},
