The Ph.D. Forum provides an opportunity for Ph.D. students to present their ongoing disse11ation research and receive valuable feedback from reputed intemational researchers. The Forum is organized in two phases. During the first phase the students participate in a day-long pre-conference workshop, present and discuss their research agenda with a mock thesis committee, and attend two invited talks on how to do good systems research in pervasive computing. During the second phase the students provide a one minute 'pitch' on their research and then resent their research at a poster session during the main conference. After a careful review process, we accepted 8 papers for presentation at the Forum out of 11 submitted. The proceedings includes a two-page abstract of each accepted submission.},

abstract={In this keynote, we look the fundamental limits of the information propagation speed in large scale mobile and intermittently connected networks, where end-to-end multihoppaths may not exist and communication routes may only beavailable through time and mobility. We first introduce some analytical toolsto derive generic theoretical bounds for the informationpropagation speed in this networks. We upper-bound the optimalperformance, in terms of delay, that can be achieved using anyrouting algorithm. We also show how our analysis can be appliedto specific mobility models to obtain specific analytical estimates. We then look at the maximum amount of data that can be transferred: (i) from a source to a destination in a given journey, (ii) overall in the network compared to the average delay. Finally we look at the particular case of multi-lane vehicle-to-vehicle networks such as roads or highways. We focus on the impact of time-varying radio ranges and of multiple lanes of vehicles, varying in speed and in density. We show the existence of a vehicle density threshold under which information propagates on average at the fastest vehicle speed and above which information propagates dramatically faster. We characterize conditions under which the phase transition occurs and we derive bounds on the corresponding threshold as a simple relationship between the vehicle density on the fastest lane and the sum of densities on the other lanes. Our results intrinsically encompass a wide range of vehicular network scenarios, including one-way and two-way roads, as well as special cases such as road side units and/or parked cars being used as relays.},

abstract={The main goal of the WristSense 2016 workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to share innovative ideas, discuss challenges, and brainstorm potential solutions to open research problems related to the domain of wrist-worn smart devices. Recently there has been a growing interest in consumerization of wrist-worn devices especially smartwatches and wrist bands. Smartwatches and bands are equipped with many sensors, a processor, communication radios and a display. It is, therefore, possible to capture information about the device user, perform computation and communication using these devices to infer various activities or contexts of the user. Further, they also represent a perfect platform to conduct research on human activity, behavior, and related areas, given the capabilities described above. Moreover, compared to smartphones, wrist-worn smart devices provide richer information about certain user activities. In most cases, a smart-watch is also connected to a powerful smartphone, which could help in drawing many interesting inferences by combining data from both these devices.},

abstract={Detecting the transportation mode of an individual's everyday travel provides useful information in urban design, real-time journey planning, and activity monitoring. In existing systems, accelerometer and GPS are the dominantly used signal sources which quickly drain the limited battery life of the wearable devices. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using the output voltage from the kinetic energy harvesting device as the signal source to achieve transportation mode detection. The proposed idea is based on the intuition that the vibrations experienced by the passenger during motoring of different transportation modes are different. Thus, voltage generated by the energy harvesting devices should contain distinctive features to distinguish different transportation modes. Using the dataset collected from a real energy harvesting device, we present the initial demonstration of the proposed method. We can achieve 98.84% of accuracy in determining whether the user is traveling by pedestrian or motorized modes, and in a fine-grained classification of three different motorized modes (car, bus, and train), an overall accuracy over 85% is achieved.},

pages={1-4}, 
abstract={To maintain acceptable levels of security, organizations must manage their IT assets and related vulnerabilities. However, this can be a considerable burden because their resources are often limited. This paper introduces a technique and system architecture that monitor the vulnerability of the IT assets on an organization's administrative networks. We use open information and standardized, non-proprietary tools in order to bolster cybersecurity capability for a wide range of organizations. In the proposed system, an agent module installed on each IT asset sends information to its server, while the server also probes the network to collect information on agentless IT assets. The server then converts the information into standard identifiers, which are used to query open repositories to obtain vulnerability information. The system provides an alert when vulnerability information pertaining to the IT asset is identified.

abstract={Being a leading online service providing both local search and social networking functions, Foursquare has attracted tens of millions of users all over the world. As a location-centric platform, Foursquare maintains the information of numerous venues, and it has recorded a tremendous amount of users' tips for these venues. Tips (micro-reviews) play a critical role in helping users find a good venue and providing comments for the venue owners. A lot of studies have been done in investigating social connections and check-in patterns among Foursquare users. However, there is a lack of a thorough study on tips, the primary type of user-generated contents (UGCs) in Foursquare. In this paper, by crawling and analyzing all tips published by more than 6 million users, we study Foursquare's tips from various aspects. We start from counting the number of tips published by different users and conduct a group-based analysis of the average number of published tips per user. Moreover, we look into the important fields of tips. We study the venue category distribution, and the evolution of the number and diversity of tips. Finally, we conduct a series of sentiment analysis by referring to the texts of all tips and introduce the concept of happiness index to evaluate the overall level of satisfaction of a set of tips. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the first comprehensive and unbiased picture of tips in Foursquare.},

abstract={Self-tracking of food intake has been studied at length, but many challenges still remain. Current systems often require significant effort from users, and work that has tried to reduce it resulted in low accuracy or delays. Effort is a major barrier to long term use of self-tracking systems. We propose CalNag, a system that integrates a weighing scale, a barcode reader, and a cloud based service. Together, they allow users to track accurate calorie consumption when preparing food at home, requiring minimal effort for each interaction with the system. Through hand-geometry bio-identification, CalNag seamlessly works for multiple users. We have developed a working prototype and conducted a pilot user study. Our results suggest that CalNag's architecture is a promising solution to effectively promote long term self-tracking of diet.},

abstract={Localization is fundamental for many wireless sensor network applications. Localizing ground-based fixed nodes through an airborne mobile anchor node is particularly useful for sensors deployed from the air, yet its dynamics are not well-understood. In this work-in-progress paper, we propose a new formulation for probabilistic localization using gradient descent, and compare it with a deterministic multilateration algorithm. We perform simulations to evaluate the localization accuracy using designated airborne mobile anchor's position. We also study the impact in both favorable and poor geometrical position of the mobile anchor node during localization. Results to date show that probabilistic gradient descent algorithm outperforms deterministic multilateration in all scenarios, with localization error reduced by up to 75%.},

While both activity recognition techniques and gesture recognition techniques employ acceleration data, these techniques are studied independently due to the large difference between the characteristics of activity sensor data and gesture sensor data. In this study, we combine their recognition using a tree structured classifier that combines features that are widely used to recognize activities with dynamic time warping-based k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Our method can recognize both activities and gestures with low computational cost by executing only the minimal set of feature extraction and classification processes that are required to recognize an input sensor-data segment. An experiment on 30 sessions of sensor data shows that our method can recognize both activities and gestures simultaneously with 95.8% accuracy while reducing computation costs by 97.3% when compared with a baseline method.},

abstract={Visible Light Positioning (VLP) is an exciting new approach but has to overcome considerable challenges before it becomes practical. In particular, the line-of-sight requirement which imports the constraint on the working condition of VLP and can not be solved by the VLP itself. This paper develops techniques to allow VLP to be augmented with traditional WI-FI approach by leveraging the WI-FI enabled smart bulbs which are now widely available. Those Smart bulbs offer several intriguing properties: a very dense deployment (roughly every 2 meters apart), ability to act as sensors that continually provide Wi-Fi signal strength measurements. We utilize these capabilities to not only build improved and practical Wi-Fi localization and Visible Light Positioning (VLP) techniques, but show that these two apparently-orthogonal techniques are symbiotic-i.e., they can mutually benefit by exploiting each other's capabilities. Moreover, we study a new VLP technique, based on modulation of a smart bulb's color temperature, that operates `out of the box' and that is compatible with camera on smartphones.},

pages={1-4}, 
abstract={Unobtrusive indoor localization aims to localize people without requiring them to carry any devices or being actively involved with the localizing process. It underpins a wide range of applications including older people surveillance, intruder detection and indoor navigation. However, in a residential home, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is heavily obstructed by furniture or domestic appliances, reducing the localization accuracy. This environment is important to observe as human-object interaction (HOI) events, detected by pervasive sensors, can reveal people's interleaved locations during daily living activities. Thus, this paper aims to enhance the performance of the RFID-based localization system by fusing human-object interactions. Specifically, we propose a general Bayesian probabilistic multi-sensor fusion framework to integrate both RSSI signals and human-object interaction events to infer the most likely location and trajectory. Unlike other RFID-based unobtrusive localization systems, which are limited to deployment and testing in cleared spacial areas, our system can work in a furnished environment. The extensive experiments with this system have a localization accuracy up to 96.7%, and average 0.58m tracking error.},

abstract={The ability of wearable cameras to continuously capture the first person viewpoint with minimal user interaction, has made them very attractive in many application domains. Wearable technology today is available and useful but not widely used and accepted due to various challenges mainly privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel efficient privacy-aware framework for wearable cameras that can protect all sensitive subjects such as people, objects (e.g, display screens, license plates and credit cards) and locations (e.g, bathrooms and bedrooms). It uses the contextual information obtained from the wearable's sensors and recorded images to identify the potential sensitive subjects in each image. Using image processing techniques, first the sensitive subjects are recognized and then blurred or eliminated. Finally the edited image is ready to publish. Using a practical case study, we experimentally evaluate the proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the proposed system can detect and blur the sensitive subjects among around 300 images with around 70% accuracy.},

abstract={Challenging 5G requirements have been proposed to enable the provision of more satisfactory services to users. One of the most critical 5G enhancements is extremely low latency compared with that of 4G. Various 5G applications will be supported by Cloud computing services. However, Cloud services sometimes have a long communication distance because of the physical location of data centers. Fog computing architecture is being introduced in 5G cellular networks to shorten the latency arising from the location of data centers. The communication delay as well as the computing delay must be considered for latency-sensitive applications. A Fog server serving many users will probably have a longer computing delay than a Fog server with a lighter workload. To clarify the computing delay and communication delay in Fog architecture, we define a mathematical model of a Fog network and the important related parameters. We also analyze results from a model used to evaluate three different policies for selecting the target Fog server for each task. We conducted simulations to evaluate this model.},

Distances and angles are the only information required to be exchanged between nodes. The process works iteratively until cameras have determined the relative position and orientation of their neighbors.

abstract={Users can now connect to the Internet through a wide variety of access networks and communication terminals. This has brought a great demand for cloud computing which allows users to enjoy various Internet services provided by data centers (DC) anytime, anywhere. In cloud computing, the problem arises that a user's quality of service is unfair among users who are different distances from DCs. To provide fair communication service to each user, we previously proposed a bandwidth allocation scheme based on collectable information in DC networks and showed the effectiveness of this approach in a case where bottleneck links exist in DC networks. However, if bottleneck links exist outside of DC networks, the link utilization in DC networks will be degraded. In this study, we propose a bandwidth reallocation scheme based on collectable information to improve link utilization in DC networks. We have confirmed the effectiveness of this approach through simulation evaluations.},

Our research goal is to develop and deploy a location-aware messaging framework that is based on indoor location detection. This framework will only deliver messages when users are at work. The system uses beacon technologies to accurately determine the position of a user inside a building.

abstract={Beacons are small Bluetooth low energy (BLE) signal emitting devices that can transmit data about their location, temperature, motion etc. Various startups have commercialized Beacon based applications, such as for tracking valuable items, micro-location targeting of people, micro payments etc. However, these applications are not customizable beyond the use cases they were designed to serve. We feel that there is a need to build software that would allow users to configure the use of beacon data subject to the requirements of an application context, and to reuse the same set of beacons for some other purpose by just modifying the configuration. In this paper we describe uBeacon, a cloud based service with a web interface that allows users to define configurations that include constraints between beacon signal readers and beacons linked to objects or people. These constraints take the form of rules, such as "Object A should always be within 1m of object/reader B." uBeacon stores these configurations in a database, continuously monitors beacon data from readers, and notifies users via mobile push notifications whenever a rule of a configuration has been violated. We report the results of a pilot study with a set of participants and discuss the several possible applications of uBeacon to highlight its usefulness.},

We present ABC3D, a custom-deigned augmented reality (AR) mobile game that harnesses the motivating power of interest and the affordances of augmented reality to engage children in practicing print-based literacy. ABC3D is bimodal, consisting of 1) a "scanning" mode which allows children to scan drawn letters and view 3D images of content starting with the same letter and 2) a "vehicle" mode which tasks children with collecting objects starting with certain letters as specified by software or instructor.

abstract={Location-based services are rapidly changing the way users explore and interact with the surrounding environment. They typically associate location information, provided by GPS or Bluetooth Low Energy devices, with remote content accessible through the Internet.

In this paper we propose Live Objects, a system for infrastructure-less proximity-based services. Live Objects are pervasive media-server devices, which can be discovered by users and stream locally stored media content in proximity without the need for an Internet connection. Live Objects can be installed anywhere, even in places without power supply and communication infrastructure. We demonstrate a deployment of Live Objects in an outdoor test field. Using these devices, together with an Android app and a software middleware, users can have a self-guided tour of the area, discover the interesting places, and get associated information, particularly in the form of high-resolution video.},

abstract={Content sharing and online collaboration have become extremely popular in recent years, in particular with the pervasiveness of cloud storage services such as Dropbox. However, these popular cloud services are not accessible when users are offline and do not take the geographical location of the users into account when distributing content. Despite years of research in opportunistic content dissemination, real users are yet to fully experience the advantages of content sharing in proximity. To this end, we propose uDrop which literally pushes the cloud storage services to the edge of the network whenever interested users are in proximity of each other. uDrop enables content sharing among users in the vicinity without relying on networking infrastructure while improving the user quality of experience and reducing the cost of bandwidth. In this demonstration, we show the practical feasibility of uDrop service on Android smartphones.},

RMR is a logic programming model with real-time support. In the light of the logic programming paradigm, RMR allows developers to write simple code to accomplish complex tasks and deploy the program in MRS in an efficient way. Moreover, RMR supports timing constraints on the behaviors of an ensemble of robots, which is not implemented by existing works.

However, the negative aspects of smartphone overuse on young adults are being increasingly recognized recently. One such serious problematic usage is peering at brightly lit screens in dark, which can cause sleep loss and resultant health problems. In this paper, we investigate the potential of exploiting sensors embedded in smartphones to detect and prevent such unhealthy habit by measuring the ambient light intensity and detecting the smartphone motion. We implement our system through an Android APP, called PreventDark. We show the feasibility and accuracy of our developed system by experiments on different android smartphones.

abstract={Location based services are widely being adopted by many commercial applications where mobile users receive incentives/rewards based on their location. In such applications, mobile users may submit their location with the assistance of various location apps which are capable to locate the mobile devices. However, there is always a possibility that users may submit false location to the service providers and gain benefits which they are not entitled of. Hence, it is necessary for service providers to request for location evidence which confirms the user's location claim. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for producing secure location fingerprint evidence and authorisation exploiting wireless signal characteristics and error tolerant fuzzy extractor. Our mechanism is secure and can detect modifications of the location evidence. The evidence generated cannot be shared with other mobile users, and hence our solution is suitable for real-time applications.},

year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={1-3}, 
abstract={Background: According to several recent research results [1]-[4], obesity can increase the risk of many diseases such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, etc. To prevent and treat the obesity efficiently and effectively, diet monitoring is an important factor. Purpose: Manual self-monitoring techniques for diet suffer from drawbacks such as low adherence, underreporting, and recall error [5]-[7]. Camera based applications that automatically extract type and quantity of food from an image of the food plate can potentially improve adherence and accuracy. However, state-of-the-art systems [8] have fairly low accuracy for identifying cooked food (only 63%) and are not fully automatic. To overcome these drawbacks such as low adherence, underreporting, recall error, low accuracy, and semi-automatedness, we introduce MT-Diet, a fully automated diet assessment system. It can identify cooked food with an accuracy of 88.93%. This is a significant improvement (over 20%) from the current state-of-the art system. Method: MT-Diet is a smartphone-based system that interfaces a thermal sensor with a smartphone. Using this system a user can take both thermal and visual images of her food plate with just one click. We used a database of 80 frozen meals which contain several different types of foods so that the actual total number of our food database 244 and the database has 33 different types of foods. By using the database, we demonstrate two core components: a) food segmentation, separating food items from the plate and recognizing multiple food items as a single food item, and b) food identification, determining the type of foods. Result: MT-Diet food segmentation methodology is fully automatic and requires no user input as opposed to recent works, the accuracy of separating food parts from the plate was 97.5%. The accuracy of food identification using Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel based on color, texture, an- histogram of oriented gradients features is 88.5%. Conclusion: We suggest a new and novel approach for diet assessment, MT-Diet. Our approach can potentially be an inexpensive, real time for the feedback on calorie intake, easy-to-use, privacy preservation, personalization based on eating habits of individuals, and fully automated diet monitoring system. The tool can also be used to conduct clinical studies to develop models of meal patterns that can be incorporated to design better artificial pancreas.},

pages={1-3}, 
abstract={This work demonstrates the effects of multi-layer adaptivity for a wireless live video streaming scenario. We investigate a specific type of adaptations, the so-called transitions, which switch between different network mechanisms during the runtime of an application. In comparison to a pure configuration adaptation, a transition is beneficial because a system may select those mechanisms that perform best under varying environmental conditions. We consider transitions on the overlay (by switching between different stream delivery schemes on the application layer) as well as on the underlay (by switching between different wireless topologies). At the beginning of our demonstration, some few devices receive the video stream from a central server. Then, additional devices start receiving the video stream. Under these circumstances, a transition from the client/server delivery scheme to a decentralized peer-to-peer based video streaming improves scalability. On the underlay, video stream delivery benefits from topology control mechanisms, which select specific wireless neighbors in order to restrict communication to energy-efficient communication links. However, topology control also reduces the robustness of the underlay topology. Thus, when devices that are critical nodes in the wireless network are on the verge of running out of energy, we conduct a transition to a more robust underlay topology. In summary, by performing transitions jointly on multiple layers, we demonstrate resulting improvements of energy efficiency, scalability and robustness.},

abstract={An important aspect of wireless sensor networks operation is identifying the physical location of each sensor in a 3-D space - a process known as localization. Typically, localization uses the position of known reference points or anchors, and estimates of distance to anchors to estimate the position of unknown nodes. An alternative of using fixed anchors is to use mobile anchors whose position can be dynamically determined using technologies such as GPS. This research project uses a specific motivational scenario to investigate localization methods using airborne mobile anchors. Sensor nodes which are carried by an airplane (a mobile anchor which is equipped with GPS) are dropped and randomly scattered within a deployment area. After deployment, the aircraft will make another pass over the deployment and act as a mobile anchor, broadcasting its position periodically using beacon packets, which are used by the blind nodes to localize themselves. These blind nodes estimate distance to the mobile anchor positions using Received Signal Strength Indicator.},

year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={1-3}, 
abstract={In the context of developing countries, buildings account for around one-third of aggregate energy consumption with decentralized air conditioners (AC) being the major contributor. The possibility of room-level control, together with buildings substandard thermal insulation make decentralized ACs, an attractive target for energy conservation. Our overall objective is to provide targeted feedback for optimized and efficient use of ACs by the occupant without affecting their thermal comfort. In our first work, we developed a system PACMAN for nonintrusive (using ambient temperature information) prediction (prior-usage) and estimation (post-usage) of AC energy consumption. We adapted a thermal model from existing literature and validated our approach using the data collected in an in-situ study conducted across seven homes in Delhi (India). The dataset contained around 2200 hours of usage data from the different ACs, room types, and thermostat temperatures. We achieved an average accuracy of 85% and 83% with the best accuracy of 97% and 93% for the estimation and prediction of AC energy consumption respectively, across all homes. During the study, we realized that easy-to-collect ambient information such as temperature (using various pervasive and ubiquitous devices such as smartphones) can generate actionable feedback for the occupants. We also observed that human activity, room structure, and several such factors impact the performance of PACMAN. Thus, we next performed controlled experiments to understand the effect of these factors on PACMAN and thus enhance our thermal model. One of the main conclusions was that sensor position plays a crucial role in the optimal control of AC. Also, windows exposed to the environment outside the room makes the most significant impact on AC energy consumption. In our ongoing work, we focus on finding the optimal position for the thermostat to reduce AC energy consumption without affecting occupant's thermal comfort. In future, w- plan to propose a framework to detect anomalies in AC within time, as delay in that might lead to appliance failure or inefficient outcome.},

abstract={Determining the behaviour and habits of individuals and the structure and dynamics of organizations needs human activity modeling from large-scale sensor data. The data can be derived from sensors embedded in smartphones, which have become an integral part of our daily lives. The analysis of the smartphone data provides valuable information about the users' daily routines and also helps us to find any unexpected changes. This research proposes a method to detect the changes and anomalies in a user's mobility pattern based on smartphone data. The data includes connectivity from cell tower ID (CID), wifi, Bluetooth, and any other embedded sensors in smartphone. We model the data from each day as a point in a feature space and then define a metric to find the similarities between the points. Therefore, each point represents user's mobility in a day and close points denote similar behaviours. The main challenge is defining the appropriate features which abstract mobility patterns in the corresponding day. One of the features is temporal clusters which show when the user changes his location.},

abstract={With the proliferation of pervasive computing which enables global connectivity of surrounding objects, the importance of security and its methodology is getting more recognized recently. However, since networking devices composing the pervasive computing are usually resource-constrained compared to traditional devices, there are many difficulties in deploying complex security functionality on them. Even if they have succeeded to provide security protocol, use of heavy authentications such as public key infrastructure or certificate-based credential type often becomes another burden. Meanwhile, the most popular and lightweight authentication type is Pre-shared Key (PSK), however, it can be easily exposed by attackers. To overcome this limitation, we present a pre-shared key chaining system which utilizes lightweight PSK and offers moving defense against key attacks with a small overhead. The system generates a chain of arbitrary PSKs without any secret exchanges and provides a new PSK from the chain at each secure session. This work enables constrained devices to communicate in a secure way without high risks of getting compromised, lightweight all the same.},

abstract={Indoor localization and activity recognition is a fundamental research topic for a wide range of important applications such as fall detection of elderly people. It usually requires an intelligent environment to successfully infer where and what a person is doing. However, many of the existing techniques on localization and activity recognition rely heavily on people's involvement such as wearing battery-powered sensors, which might not be practical in real-world situations (e.g., people may forget to wear sensors). In this project, we propose a device-free localization and activity recognition approach using passive RFID tags. It is achieved by learning how the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from the passive RFID tag array is distributed when a person performs different activities in different locations. After activity patterns are discovered for a particular individual, we will also develop a context-aware, common-sense based activity reasoning engine that assists applications to make appropriate interpretation of detected activities. We believe the proposed system has the potential to better support the independent living of elderly people considering the continuously increased aging population.},

abstract={This talk will present a vision, and real-world examples, of the use of mobile crowdsourcing for building a variety of smart-city applications and services. I will first describe the paradigm of centrally-coordinated crowdsourcing, where the crowdsourcing platform intelligently recommends different tasks to different candidate workers, and contrast it with today's prevalent paradigm, where workers select and perform tasks in an uncoordinated, opportunistic fashion. I will then describe real-world examples of such crowdsourcing (and participatory sensing) for two applications: (a) smart campus monitoring and (b) last-mile urban logistics (package pickup and delivery). The talk will also describe the opportunities and open challenges involved in making such crowdsourcing an organic part of real-time municipal services monitoring and delivery.},

abstract={Many passengers have expressed frustration in waiting for public bus endlessly without knowing the estimated arrival time. In many developing countries, requiring bus operators to invest in the installation of a GPS unit on every bus in order to track the bus location and subsequently predicting the bus arrival time can be costly. This paper proposes passenger-assisted sharing of bus location to provide an estimation of bus arrival time. Our scheme aims to exploit the availability and capability of passenger mobile phones to share location information of the travelling buses in order to collect transportation data, at the same time provide an estimation of bus arrival time to the general public. A mobile app is developed to periodically report bus location to the cloud service, and it can detect location spoofing by malicious users. The preliminary results of the field tests suggest that the proposed system is viable and the predicated ETA falls within three minutes of the bus actual arrival time.},

abstract={Considering the sprawl of the cities, the conventional public transport (CPT) with fixed route and fixed schedule becomes less efficient and desirable every day. However, the emerging technologies in computation and communication are facilitating more adaptive types of public transport, such as Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) systems, which operate according to the demand. It is crucial to study the feasibility and advantages of these systems before implementation to prevent failure and financial loss. In this work, a realistic model is provided by incorporating a dynamic routing algorithm into an agent-based traffic simulation to compare DRT and CPT. This model provides a high spatial and temporal granularity, which makes it possible to analyze the results on an individual level. The results showed that replacing CPT with DRT will improve the mobility by decreasing the perceived travel time by passengers and without any extra cost under certain circumstances.},

abstract={Road traffic data analysis has become a major focus of data mining research due to the key role it plays in optimizing road network performance. A major challenge for query processing on road traffic data is the time and memory required due to the large volume of traffic measurements available. We propose a method that provides high compression ratio while achieving high query accuracy for compressed network traffic data. We use temporal graphs for representing traffic data as they can preserve both the topological and temporal relations in the network. Unlike existing methods which mainly focus on unweighted graphs, we aim at analysing connected weighted graphs. The main idea is to exploit the redundancies between consecutive snapshots in a temporal graph to approximate the queries efficiently. Our method is demonstrated on real life road traffic network data from Melbourne. Results are compared to the output of another recent approach, and our results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve greater time efficiency with similar accuracy.},

abstract={Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are vital to increase safety and reduce congestion problems. ITS can support several applications such as emergency management, automatic road enforcement, variable speed limits, collision avoidance systems, dynamic traffic light sequence and many more. These applications use heterogeneous technologies for sensing, communications, and computation. A number of sensing technologies have been used for the ITS applications such as cameras, sensors, inductive loop detection to know the contextual information of the given environment. These technologies are measuring almost the same information but in various formats. Similarly, several technologies are widely used for short and long range communications within ITS. Future, ITS will require wireless communication among vehicles and the road side infrastructure. Furthermore, ITS applications require realtime computation due to critical functions that need to provide realtime feedback to the end-users. In this paper, we proposed and developed a software platform to solve the challenging issues that came from sensing, communication and computation within ITS applications. The platform can process data from heterogeneous sources and makes sure that data availability and quality are maintained. Moreover, the proposed software platform is able to analyze data from heterogeneous sources to find valuable insights accordingly. Finally, we designed and developed a visualization layer to communicate valuable insights from the collected data to the end-users by exploiting various visualization techniques.},

abstract={An important challenge for brick-and-mortar retail businesses is how to monitor the interest of customers in displays and products in a store. We investigate the effectiveness of the Microsoft Kinect as a sensor to monitor the behaviour of pedestrians, which may reflect their interest in a store display or advertisement. In a controlled environment, participants acting as pedestrians are requested to show different levels of interest as they pass an object that is being monitored by a Kinect sensor. The sensor collected measurements such as the positions and orientation of the pedestrian's body and head, which were analysed to detect the movements of the pedestrians and thus infer the behaviour they exhibited. Our results demonstrate that when the Kinect is able to detect a behaviour that indicates a pedestrian's interest in an object, then the classification of the level of interest in terms of the type of behaviour is reasonably accurate under varying light conditions and numbers of pedestrians.},

Applications can be developed to perform computation on this data and gain group level aggregate inferences and provide feedback. We propose "SafeDrive", an autonomous transportation application, that estimates mental fatigue of a driver using brain sensors, predicts collision probability by fusing car parameters with driver mental state, and issues feedback just in time to avoid accidents. However, significant challenges exist with respect to ensuring safety, accurate context computation and real-time operation, and sustainability, resource efficiency. In this regard, we present the "HumaNet" framework that consists of a middleware installed in mobile devices for developing aware cities applications. HumaNet applies model-based requirements checking approach for off-line analysis and optimization of a given application. Further, it applies context-based requirements checking to decide how to use different types of computation resources to satisfy safety and sustainability requirements in run-time.},

abstract={The vision of smart cities and IoT is an environment blanketed with interconnected, software-enabled devices. Unlike software installed on personal devices, however, people may not know about services in the environment, or may not even be the intended users. People lack a unified way to discover software services in a smart city infrastructure, and the current device-centric approach to IoT is inconsistent with the growing network and software services associated with these devices. In this paper we outline changes needed in the current IoT framework to shift to a service model for IoT. We describe how, similar to users of a personal computing device, users can define their preferences, install services, and manage the data that is generated and consumed by services. In this framework, service preferences provide a basis for proper service discovery. As an illustration of the proposed model, we provide modifications to the well established Auto-ID Object Name Service and Physical Markup Language architecture to demonstrate how a practical system can support the concept of IoT services and discovery.},

abstract={The convergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and the Cloud has significantly facilitated the provision and management of services in large-scale applications such as smart cities. With a huge number of IoT services accessible through clouds, it is very important to model and expose cloud-based IoT services in a scalable manner, promising easy and realtime delivery of smart city services. The existing work in this area does not sufficiently address this design issue due to the adoption of a uniform and flat view to the structure of IoT services and their data in the Cloud. In this paper, we propose a framework for scalable and realtime provisioning of cloud-based IoT services in large-scale applications, such as smart cities. These two features are achieved by structuring the description of IoT services in a hierarchical model and populating them in a tree structure containing references to services and their realtime data. Such a service access structure can be obtained based on logical or contextual scopes of a service. Using this approach, smart city applications can access IoT services and subscribe to their realtime data in an scalable manner at different contextual levels, e.g., from a municipal district to a street.},

abstract={Crowdsourcing offers a cost-effective approach to distributed problem solving and data collection by soliciting contributions (solutions, ideas, data, etc.) from a large group of people. Recently, due to the burgeoning smartphone industry and the surging demand for sensing data, a new mobile computing and sensing paradigm called mobile crowdsensing has emerged and has created significant momentum in both industry and academia. Pivotal to the viability of all such crowdsourcing systems, is whether there is enough incentive to attract sufficient participation. Many crowdsourcing scenarios are heterogeneous in the sense that, not only the workers types (e.g., abilities and costs) are different, but the beliefs (probabilistic knowledge) about their respective types are also different. In this talk, we design an incentive mechanism for such scenarios using an asymmetric all-pay contest (or auction) model. Our design objective is an optimal mechanism, i.e., one that maximizes the crowdsourcing revenue minus cost. To achieve this, we furnish the contest with a prize tuple which is an array of reward functions for each potential winner (worker). We prove and characterize the unique equilibrium of this contest, and solve the optimal prize tuple. In addition, this study discovers a counter-intuitive property, strategy autonomy (SA), which means that heterogeneous workers behave independently of one another as if they were in a homogeneous setting. In the second part of the talk, we propose the use of Tullock contests as an alternative framework to design incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing. We explore a new dimension of optimal Tullock contents design by provisioning the prize as a function. We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to attracting user entry in other domains. In this talk, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by superseding the contest prize-which is fixed in conventional Tullock contests-with a prize function that i- dependent on the (unknown) winners contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcers utility. We show that this approach leads to several attractive practical advantages.},

abstract={Natural disasters have inflicted serious damage on humankind from time to time. Some of the most severe disasters in Japan and many other countries are said to be earthquakes, which frequently trigger secondary disasters such as tsunamis, landslides, and fire accidents. In fact, most casualties in an earthquake are not due to the earthquake itself but to such secondary disasters. Therefore, it is essential to detect the occurrence of each disaster and gather additional real-time information in order to minimize the number of casualties. Considering this background, we concentrated on creating an effective system for propagating information on fire accidents swiftly using pedestrians' mobile phones, because we considered it easy to detect fire accidents among these secondary disasters. In this paper, we focus on establishing a configuration-free system for propagating fire alerts only by attaching an ad-hoc network device to the fire alarm generally installed in each house. Thus, we can collect information on fire accidents without configuring any personal location information. We evaluate how effective this system is in the event of fire, and the results show that we can estimate the location of fire with an error of <;20 m. This is accurate enough to locate a fire in order to obtain an overview of the situation.},

abstract={When a crisis or a disaster occurs, first responders, news agencies and the victims often use social media to disseminate situational information. However, authorities involved in disaster management are still not comfortable in using social media data to take decision, since right kind of situational information in a consistent manner is difficult to extract from the unstructured and often unreliable social media posts. To get meaningful data from people at disaster site, we propose a system framework and a research prototype that uses interactive crowdsourcing using SMS and Twitter to collect data form the "crowd" at disaster site. We define crowdsourcing in this context as an adaptive process that relies on an interactive dialogue between our system and each member of the crowd (disaster victims/ volunteers/ first responders) willing to contribute consistent information that would help the system to build a structured repository of information. The same repository can be used to take decision and answer users' queries on specific issues related to that disaster. Experiments have been performed using both SMS and Twitter in the context of recent earthquake at Nepal to validate our system and demonstrate that interactive crowdsourcing is helpful in decision making to manage disaster.},

abstract={Cyber-physical applications, deployed on top of Building Management Systems (BMS), promise energy saving and comfort improvement in non-residential buildings. Such applications are so far mainly deployed as research prototypes. The main roadblock to widespread adoption is the low quality of BMS metadata. There is indeed a mismatch between (i) the anecdotal nature of metadata for legacy BMS - they are usually initialized when the BMS is commissioned and later neglected-, and (ii) the imperious need for consistent and up-to-date metadata for supporting building analytics or personalized control systems. Such applications access sensors and actuators through BMS metadata in form of point labels. The naming of labels is however often inconsistent and incomplete. To tackle this problem, we introduce Babel, a crowd-sourced approach to the creation and maintenance of BMS metadata. In our system, occupants provide physical and digital input in form of actuations (e.g., the turning on/off a light) and readings (e.g., reading room temperature of a thermostat) to Babel. Babel then matches this input to digital points in the BMS based on value equality. We have implemented a prototype of our system in a non-residential building. While our approach can not solve all metadata problems, we show that it is able to match end-user relevant points in a fast and precise manner.},

abstract={The amount and diversity of sensors on modern mobile devices, together with the computing performance that these devices can guarantee, make crowdsensing an important alternative to traditional sensor networks. Crowdsensing applications often exploit server-side components to aggregate, correlate, and manipulate the data collected my the mobile devices in the field. We advocate that this architecture limits the scenarios in which crowdsensing can be applied. Instead, we believe that crowdsensing should transition to a distributed foglike architecture, in which edge devices can be made responsible for most of the computation that needs to be achieved. In this paper we present A3Droid, a framework for developing crowdsensing applications for the Android platform. It supports a fog-like architecture, and helps the developer create robust and scalable applications that can collect and use high-quality data from the field. A3Droid was evaluated in a lab experiment that mimics a scenario in which geo-located data are collected from moving buses to gather up-to-date information about a city's traffic.},

abstract={Sensing user activities and environmental conditions have been popular by using high functional sensor devices like smartphones. In modern data collection and utilization models such as participatory sensing and crowdsensing, some users provides data sensed from their smartphones while others collect these data via the clouds and servers. Reflecting providers policy is strongly required because collected data using such models may include provider's privacy. We have studied a new server-less participatory sensing application model in which users are able to flexibly control their data flow based on their own providing policy appropriate for receivers. In this paper, we improve negotiation mechanism among users by introducing the market price based user matching mechanism. We also confirm its feasibility and effectiveness through simulation results.},

abstract={Emission of airborne pollutants and climate gasses from the transport sector is a growing problem, both in industrialised and developing countries. Planning of urban transport system is essential to minimise the environmental, health and economic impact of congestion in the transport system. To get accurate and timely information on traffic congestion, and by extension information on air pollution, near real time traffic models are needed. We present in this paper an implementation of the Restricted Stochastic User equilibrium model, that is capable to model congestions for very large Urban traffic systems, in less than an hour. The model is implemented in an open source database system, for easy interface with GIS resources and crowd sensed transportation data.},

abstract={With the increasing dependency of ubiquitous connectivity for applications ranging from multimedia entertainment to intelligent transportation systems, having good signal coverage becomes vital. Therefore, route planners and navigation systems should take into account not only the physical distance, but also the characteristics and availability of the cellular network on the potential routes. In this paper we present a route planning tool that finds the connectivity-aware shortest paths based on crowdsourced data from OpenStreetMap and OpenSignal. The tool calculates optimal paths and allows physical distance to be traded against signal quality. The evaluation shows that a 15% increase of the physical path length can achieve an 8.7dBm improvement of worst-case signal strength.},

abstract={The world senior population is projected to douDle as a percentage over the whole population in the next decades. In order to preserve or improve the quality of life of this population, as well as to keep healthcare costs sustainable, it is important to better support their ability of independent living. Cognitive decline is a major threat to independent living; it may be experienced in normal aging but it may also lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and more serious neurodegenerative cognitive disorders. Early detection of cognitive decline, accurate diagnosis and monitoring of its evolution for early intervention are a priority. Researchers have found that subtle differences in performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) as well as the recognition of subtle errors while performing IADLs may be useful for MCI diagnosis as well as to differentiate different forms of cognitive disorders. However, occasionally performing ability tests in equipped rooms on medical premises has several shortcomings including cost and reliability of results. Pervasive computing coupled with intelligent data analysis can have a major role in this application domain by continuous monitoring of activities at home during daily life. This idea has been at the core of several recent research projects. The main challenges that we are facing are: a) reliability, unobtrusiveness and affordability of the sensor infrastructure, b) precision and robustness of techniques for IADL recognition, c) effectiveness of algorithms for recognizing fine-grained abnormal behaviors identified by clinicians as relevant indicators, d) identification of relevant patterns through long-term data analysis, e) privacy-awareness of data acquisition and management, f) effectiveness of visualization and interaction tools for clinicians. This talk will discuss the above challenges, report the experience on using hybrid statistical and knowledge-based techniques for addressing the recognition- tasks, and identify critical aspects still to be investigated.},

abstract={Crowd-sensing is a popular way to sense and collect data using smartphones that reveals user behaviors and their correlations with device performance. PhoneLab is one of the largest crowd-sensing platform based on the Android system. Through experimental instrumentations and system modifications, researchers can tap into a sea of insightful information that can be further processed to reveal valuable context information about the device, user and the environment. However, the PhoneLab data is in JSON format. The process of inferring reasons from data in this format is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce PLOMaR - an ontology framework that uses SPARQL rules to help researchers access information and derive new information without complex data processing. The goals are to (i) make the measurement data more accessible, (ii) increase interoperability and reusability of data gathered from different sources, (iii) develop extensible data representation to support future development of the PhoneLab platform. We describe the models, the JSON to RDF mapping processes, and the SPARQL rules used for deriving new information. We evaluate our framework with three application examples based on the sample dataset provided.},

This new form of computing gives rise to huge economical and societal expectations. However, pervasive applications raise major challenges in term of software engineering and remain hard to develop, deploy, execute and maintain. Context-awareness, in particular, is a salient and difficult property that must be met by pervasive applications.

abstract={Users want IoT environments to provide them with personalized support. These environments therefore need to be able to learn user preferences, such as what temperature the room should be or which lights should be turned on. We propose a novel system that separates the tasks of learning a user's preferences and realizing them within the environment. The system is able to capture user preferences by reinterpreting the problem as an optimization problem and applying inverse reinforcement learning to it. The system is shown to be able to accurately extract simple preferences given a small number of user demonstrations. These preferences are then realized by actuates devices running reinforcement learning-based agents to provide an environment consistent with the learnt preferences, also in situations not included in any user demonstration.},

abstract={The information of a person's activity can be used for a multitude of application. Thus, the activity recognition and the improvement of the activity recognition performance is a focus of research. Unfortunately, activities similar to each other are still likely to be mixed up during the activity recognition, resulting in a decrease in activity recognition performance. We propose a lightweight method to improve the recognition performance. By reevaluating recognized activities, we group similar activities to a new activity. We refer the created activity as grouped activity. We evaluate our method with an activity-set of seven activities and compare the results with two common approaches: the average recognition performance of the individual activities and the recognition performance using a generalized activity. We show an F-Measure improvement of up to 6.6 % by using the grouped activity.},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Achieving energy-efficiency is a challenging task in human activity monitoring. The continuous activity sensing using accelerometer and the burdensome on-node classification rapidly deplete the limited battery resource of the wearable nodes. To reduce the energy overhead and achieve the system energy-neutrality, we present a novel Bayesian framework for human activity monitoring using the energy-harvesting wearable sensors. The proposed framework utilizes a capacitor to store the harvested kinetic energy and uses all the stored energy to transmit an unmodulated signal, called an activity pulse. Our framework can infer the human activity directly from the received signal strength of the activity pulse at a remote server. Neither accelerometer nor classifier is required on the wearable devices, and therefore, our framework guarantees the system energy-neutrality. Using a real dataset collected from a kinetic energy harvester coupled with a Bluetooth prototype, an overall accuracy of 91% is achieved when the distance between the transmitter and the receiver is set to 30 cm.},

abstract={Pervasive computing applications have long used contact free object detection to process images collected from smartphone, tablet and wearable cameras. Two key challenges encountered in uncontrolled environments are the detection accuracy and speed, more so on computationally limited embedded systems. Recent technological advances have led to the emergence of depth sensors being integrated in a variety of embedded devices such as smartphones and wearables. Depth sensors are contact free and avoid some of the pitfalls caused by variations in lighting and background conditions that are typically associated with images from conventional cameras. This paper presents QuickFind, a fast and lightweight algorithm for object detection using only depth data. QuickFind is fast and particularly suited to run on embedded platforms as it uses a quick method for segmentation and makes use of low overhead features. We demonstrate empirically the performance of QuickFind by benchmarking on two embedded systems: Raspberry Pi and Intel Edison. We also demonstrate the wide applicability of QuickFind by developing two proof-of-concept pervasive computing applications.},

year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-7}, 
abstract={The proliferation of smartphones nowadays has enabled many crowd assisted applications including audio-based sensing. In such applications, detected sound sources are meaningless without location information. However, it is challenging to localize sound sources accurately in a crowd using only microphones integrated in smartphones without existing infrastructures, such as dedicated microphone sensor systems. The main reason is that a smartphone is a nondeterministic platform that produces large and unpredictable variance in data measurements. Most existing localization methods are deterministic algorithms that are ill suited or cannot be applied to sound source localization using only smartphones. In this paper, we propose a distributed localization scheme using nondeterministic algorithms. We use the multiple possible outcomes of nondeterministic algorithms to weed out the effect of outliers in data measurements and improve the accuracy of sound localization. We then proposed to optimize the cost function using least absolute deviations rather than ordinary least squares to lessen the influence of the outliers. To evaluate our proposal, we conduct a testbed experiment with a set of 16 Android devices and 9 sound sources. The experiment results show that our nondeterministic localization algorithm achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.19 m, which is close to the Cramer-Rao bound (0.8 m). Meanwhile, the best RMSE of compared deterministic algorithms is 2.64 m.},

One fundamental question of DFLAR is how to design discriminative features to characterize the raw wireless signal. Existing works manually design handcraft features, e.g., mean and variance of the raw signal, which is not universal for different activities. Inspired by the deep learning theory, we explore to learn universal and discriminative features automatically with a deep learning model. By merging the learned new features into a softmax regression based machine learning framework, we develop a deep learning based DFLAR system. Experimental evaluations with an 8 wireless nodes testbed confirms that compared with traditional handcraft features, DFLAR system with the learned features could achieve better performance.},

Applications include environment and crowd behaviour tracking in real time, assisted living, health monitoring, or also domestic appliance control.

volume={},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={With the popularity of mobile devices, Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is emerging as a new framework that enables human workers to perform tasks in the physical world. With spatial crowdsourcing, the goal is to outsource a set of spatiotemporal tasks (i.e., tasks with time and location) to a set of workers, which requires the workers to be physically present at the location of the tasks in order to perform them. Research efforts have focused on different aspects of SC, such as task assignment, task scheduling and protecting workers' privacy. However, one of the biggest challenges for the research community is the absence of public real-world datasets from SC applications such as Uber, TaskRabbit, etc. Therefore, we propose a synthetic workload generator for the SC applications, namely SCAWG1, to produce common datasets for experimentation, thus leading to reproducible research. SCAWG facilitates and standardizes workload generation in SC research. Specifically, SCAWG considers realistic spatiotemporal properties and behaviors for both workers and tasks. In addition, to further emulate the real-world workloads, it considers various application-specific constraints and properties of workers and tasks as well as their temporal arrival patterns. SCAWG is very flexible and thus can be customized for different spatial crowdsourcing and crowdsensing applications via a set of user-defined parameters and distributions. We developed an open-source toolbox2 to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of SCAWG. The toolbox is designed to be generic and extensible, which would expedite experimental studies.},

In order to be able to understand the current state of crowdsourcing initiatives, a means to systematically view the myriad of existing crowdsourcing initiatives is needed. In this paper, we present our work on the construction of a taxonomy of crowdsourcing initiatives, which was built after reviewing a total of 60 exemplary crowdsourcing initiatives. The taxonomy, which consists of six components; user, process, content, platform, task and reward, can be used as a benchmark to better understand the current state of crowdsourcing initiatives with regards to the components that constitute the initiatives as it allows systematic comparison of existing crowdsourcing initiatives to be made. It can also serve as the basis for the development of metrics for evaluating crowdsourcing initiatives.},

abstract={Social media is of great significance in modern society and the analysis of Twitter data has shown an increasing trend towards supporting different research efforts, from understanding society to marketing and analysis of organizations. The ubiquity of Twitter with over 2.9million Tweeters in Australia alone means that it can be used for many (potentially unforeseen) activities. In this paper we consider how it can be used for estimation of crowd sizes. This is useful for calculating public event attendance as well as for potential safety concerns. In order to establish the relationship between social media usage and crowd sizes we focus on a range of sporting events, where attendances are known. From this we create a prediction model that can be used to estimate unknown crowd sizes based on social media use alone. We show how it is possible to benchmark the accuracy of the crowd size estimation by introducing other information. Finally, we apply the prediction model to estimate the attendance at the Melbourne marathon event where unknown numbers of attendees were present.},

abstract={Summary form only given. First part of this talk will discuss how the community is converging towards the IoT vision having worked in wireless sensor networking and Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication. This will follow a general discussion of security challenges in IoT. Finally I will discuss some results from an ongoing project on security of bodyworn devices. Wireless bodyworn sensing devices are becoming popular for fitness, sports training and personalized healthcare applications. Securing the data generated by these devices is essential if they are to be integrated into the current health infrastructure and employed in medical applications. In this talk, I will discuss a mechanism to secure data provenance for these devices by exploiting symmetric spatio-temporal characteristics of the wireless link between two communicating parties. Our solution enables both parties to generate closely matching `link' fingerprints, which uniquely associate a data session with a wireless link such that a third party, at a later date, can verify the links the data was communicated on. These fingerprints are very hard for an eavesdropper to forge, lightweight compared to traditional provenance mechanisms, and allow for interesting security properties such as accountability and non-repudiation. I will present our solution with experiments using bodyworn devices in scenarios approximating actual device deployment.},

abstract={As Internet of Things advances, various smart objects and services permeate in our living environment. Due to their dynamic join/leave behaviors, service discovery protocols (SDPs) have been proposed. As new SDPs are introduced and legacy SDPs evolve, the incompatible islands of smart objects inevitably arise. To solve this issue, many research works are presented, but they cannot accommodate a new protocol or a new version of the legacy protocol. To solve this limitation, we propose an intelligent SDP discovery scheme based on knowledge-based adaptive probing. It is composed of two main building blocks, SDP knowledge base and adaptive probing procedure. In the case study, a user device successfully discovers a new SDP version by means of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={As sensors become more affordable, sensor networks are increasingly deployed to monitor diverse environments. However, these sensor network deployments often utilize different standards for communication and data storage. As a result, it is challenging to build large-scale pervasive systems able to find, query, and analyze information across a diverse set of sensor networks. Additionally, aggregating sensor data from various sources is difficult because data can be sampled using different levels, units, rates, and resolutions. To address these challenges, we have developed a pervasive sensor network search environment based on natural language processing and the semantic web. By using natural language, we can understand the context of the query and use semantic rules about the data to aggregate and transform data to more useful results. To demonstrate the system, we have deployed the environment in two application domains. In each domain, the system successfully answers domain-specific natural language queries.},

abstract={In this work, we propose a framework for resolving ambiguity in user-generated natural language queries. We use pragmatics to formalize the refinement of an incoming query into possible interpretations which we call a response graph. Each of the possible interpretations are assigned likelihoods of being correct by the pragmatics framework, as well as Quality of Information (QoI) scores that quantify how useful we expect the response to be. We discuss two schemes for traversing the response graph and determining the querent's intended meaning, an up-front one-shot algorithm ("static") and an iterative runtime algorithm ("dynamic"). We analyze the performance of these two schemes by presenting data from simulated conversations between a querent and system using randomly generated response graphs. We show that both schemes are able to achieve a significant reduction in the cost to retrieve the desired information, allowing such a system to make more intelligent decisions about how to handle and respond to natural language queries.},

abstract={With the growth in elderly population in Singapore, healthcare expenditure and prevalence of age-related illnesses are expected to increase. Non-adherence among the elderly is a common issue that leads to adverse health complications, particularly among those with chronic conditions. However, existing studies typically focus on identifying predictors of medication adherence, and provide neither user-friendly nor actionable solutions that can be easily adopted by the elderly. In this paper, we use the Internet of Things to monitor medication adherence and detect changes in medication consumption patterns among the elderly, thus enabling timely interventions by caregivers to take place. Sensor-enabled medication boxes are deployed in the residences of ten elderly participants for more than four months, since Jul 2015. Preliminary results indicate that our solution can effectively monitor medication intake patterns, and identify elderly who are non medication-adhering.},

Considering global social issues such as aged society besides the technologies, senior citizens suffering from memory loss would be one of potential user groups. Since the use of eyeglasses among the elderly is quite common, we have constructed a navigation interface on eyeglasses by implanting a set of light emitting diode indicators on the frame of the glasses. We aim to realize eyeglasses-based navigation system that provides the elderly with the visual cues and could be interpreted intuitively as navigational commands. Furthermore, we believe that our system would improve the independent mobility of the elderly. This paper explains our first prototype glasses with near-eye LED indicators, incremental experimentation, and the preliminary results that are used to optimize the visual cues for real navigational tasks.

abstract={Unobtrusive in-home monitoring systems are gaining acceptability and are being deployed to enable relatives and caregivers to remotely monitor and provide timely care to their elderly loved ones or senior clients, respectively, who are living independently. Such systems can provide information about non-movement or inactivity of the elderly resident. As prolonged inactivity could mean potential danger, several algorithms have been proposed to automatically detect unusually long durations of inactivity. Such schemes, however, suffer from low sensitivity due to their high detection latency. In this paper, we propose Dwell Time-enhanced Dynamic Threshold (DTDT), a scheme for computing adaptive alert thresholds that exploit region-specific dwell time to reduce the detection latency. Using extreme value theory, we obtain a closed form expression for the per-region alert thresholds. We perform simulations using real data to evaluate the performance of DTDT and compare it with state-of-the art schemes AID and the algorithm by Moshtaghi et al. Results show that DTDT shows significantly lower detection latency, 1.5-3 hours shorter, in regions with short dwell times (bathroom and kitchen) while maintaining the same false alarm rate.},

abstract={Fall related injuries are one of the biggest problem the elderly and the visually impaired populations face everyday. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that about one-third of Americans over the age of 65 fall every year. And according to the American Foundation for the Blind, 25 million Americans suffer from total or partial vision loss, which are twice as likely to fall as their sighted counterparts. This creates a need for preventative systems that would allow for the detection of objects that may constitute a tripping hazard. This paper relates to the implementation of a component that will be part of a much larger system that will allow elderly and visually impaired people navigate safely in indoors environments using off-the-shelf smartphones. The component refers to a floor detection module that will identify the floor ahead of the walking person in structured and unstructured environments in real time. A structured environment is an area with a well defined shape such as hallway, and an unstructured environment is an area without a known shape (not all rooms are the same). Floor detection is a challenging task considering the real time nature of the system, and the use of resource-constrained devices such as smartphones. The evaluation of the system showed that it can work in real time with a run time of 1s. The accuracy of the floor detection module in unstructured environments was measured at 87.6% and 93% in structured environment.},

abstract={Recently, as elderly people population grows, the burden on caretakers are getting larger. In day care center, caretakers are taking care records aiming to improve care receiver's Quality of Life (QoL). However, in the present situation, it is difficult for caretakers to record care receiver's activity in detail because each care worker needs to take care of several care receivers at the same time and it is a large burden. To reduce the burden of caretakers, many elderly monitoring systems have been proposed so far, but most of them are not effective in the sense that they force care receivers to use dedicated device such as smart phone and/or particular applications that are obtrusive and cumbersome for care receivers. In this paper, we propose a novel elderly monitoring system which can monitor movements/activity of multiple care receivers at the same time by estimating existence area of each of the care receivers, without burdening them. Our proposed system estimates multiple care receivers existence area only using RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The feature of our proposed system is that it takes Movable-Beacon and Fixed Scanner style. We have validated the proposed system and confirmed that we can estimate multi-person's existence area at high accuracy using only BLE devices.},

abstract={Healthcare is increasingly a collaborative effort involving caregivers from several different organizations providing services to the same patient. This is particularly the case in care for the elderly and chronically ill, where a preference for care in the home is common. Current systems lack support for care scenarios that require mobility and intra-organizational collaboration. This results in an inefficient work situation that relies on old technologies - paper notes, phones calls, fax - for communication, which ultimately threaten the medical safety of patients. In this paper we present a system designed for this collaborative situation covering both mobile work in a single organization (home care) and collaboration across organizations, as well as connecting devices to people. Although developed as part of a research project, the use of participatory design and iterative development has resulted in early adoption of the system which is now in professional use by both the participating hospital and municipality.},

The data exchange method of Oppline is built on top of the universal Wi-Fi standard, thus expedites platform-independent integration of related mobile applications for delay-tolerant communications in public space. Even in highly-dense mobile networks of smart portable devices, Oppline gains performance from people's participation according to our experimental analysis validated with a real-life deployment. Without creating any network overhead, Oppline performs multi-hop message transmissions via short messages encoded in and decoded from Wi-Fi's service set identifier field.

abstract={Nowadays smartphones have become crucial part of our everyday life. Smartphones come with several built-in sensors, along with powerful processing units and easy internet connectivity which make them very attractive tools in pervasive sensing space. While there are several research tracks coming up with various interesting apps which enable such pervasive sensing/ analytics through smartphones, they lack having a common framework that supports heterogeneous sensing and processing. Here we propose a common framework that can be exploited to support heterogeneous sensing, with power management and adaptive real-time performance as an added feature. The key feature is to partition the processing between the smartphone and a cloud as well as designing the software architecture to uniformly support various sensor data logging and displaying requirements. In this work, we particularly investigate feasibility of our proposed framework by actually implementing and testing with several collaborative sensing applications that are inherently heterogeneous in nature. Our results show promise as the CPU overhead and power consumption are improved quite a bit across all the solutions we have tested.},

One of the foundations of the Smart Grid is the real-time information and data exchange between all of its components, facilitated by the extended application of smart metering and information technologies. Advanced control functions integrated with the complicated and slow-dynamic electricity grid, will necessitate the use of an electricity buffer in order to maintain balance and stability at all times. Owing to their relatively low footprint and flexible geographical placement, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) will play the key role of providing the electricity buffer of the future smart grid. The challenge of BESS and their different technologies will be discussed in various scenarios of grid-related functionalities and roles.

abstract={Using pervasive computing at a scale for improving the energy performance of buildings requires that applications are portable among buildings. One problem in enabling portable applications is metadata about building infrastructures. The challenge is that there are multiple ways to annotate sensor data and actuation points, which makes it difficult to have a proper level of abstraction. Another problem is the amount of insufficient or missing metadata. This paper presents an analysis of the leading software platforms for sensor infrastructures with respect to how metadata is handled. Furthermore, the paper also presents an analysis of the leading metadata formats with respect to how they support building applications. Based on the analysis, we conclude that there is a need for a structured way to manage metadata in buildings. Therefore we present our vision of a process view on discovery, maintenance and validation of metadata in buildings.},

abstract={Many household appliances draw standby power, which can be reduced to save total energy consumption of a household. Smart plugs are proposed for effectively reducing standby power of an appliance by monitoring and cutting power when the appliance is no longer in use. However, the level of intelligence it leverages is minimal such that it still requires a direct manipulation by the user and does not make a use out of any other contexts. In this paper, we propose a context-aware standby power reduction scheme, CASPRE that reduces the total standby power of household appliances by controlling smart plugs through context reasoning. The proposed scheme leverages the notion of correlations that exist among appliances when conducting a specific task at home. An ongoing task can be inferred from contexts of multiple appliances and those that do not belong to the current task can be turned off. Experiments on real world power datasets show that the proposed scheme more effectively reduces total standby power than existing ones.},

title={Improving occupancy presence prediction via multi-label classification}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Heating and cooling of commercial buildings accounts for a large proportion of worldwide energy consumption. There exists an opportunity to reduce energy waste by improving the scheduling of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) based on occupancy. However, to enable this potential, we require more accurate methods for predicting occupancy to deliver the required level of comfort when rooms are occupied. This paper examines the novel use of multi-label classification (MLC) for predicting occupancy of rooms based on data from motion sensors. Stating the occupancy prediction problem as an MLC problem enables the use of existing MLC algorithms and provides a solid foundation for evaluating the performance of the predictive models. Our implemented algorithms are benchmarked against an existing occupancy prediction technique (PreHeat) on a dataset from two commercial buildings. The results show that PreHeat and Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms other algorithms for rooms with high occupancy frequency. Other machine learning algorithms outperform PreHeat and SVM for rooms with low occupancy frequency. In total, SVM provides a more robust performance than other algorithms with a significantly higher count of highest prediction accuracy for observed scenarios. Our experimental results also highlight that prediction performance for commercial buildings depends more on occupancy frequency than occupancy rate, and the occupancy state before the prediction horizon. By presenting more accurate algorithms for occupancy prediction, we hope to foster the development of more energy-efficient HVAC scheduling systems to reduce overall energy consumption.},

abstract={Summary form only given. In this keynote, we look the fundamental limits of the information propagation speed in large scale mobile and intermittently connected networks, where end-to-end multihop paths may not exist and communication routes may only be available through time and mobility. We first introduce some analytical tools to derive generic theoretical bounds for the information propagation speed in this networks. We upper-bound the optimal performance, in terms of delay, that can be achieved using any routing algorithm. We also show how our analysis can be applied to specific mobility models to obtain specific analytical estimates. We then look at the maximum amount of data that can be transferred: (i) from a source to a destination in a given journey, (ii) overall in the network compared to the average delay. Finally we look at the particular case of multi-lane vehicle-to-vehicle networks such as roads or highways. We focus on the impact of time-varying radio ranges and of multiple lanes of vehicles, varying in speed and in density. We show the existence of a vehicle density threshold under which information propagates on average at the fastest vehicle speed and above which information propagates dramatically faster. We characterize conditions under which the phase transition occurs and we derive bounds on the corresponding threshold as a simple relationship between the vehicle density on the fastest lane and the sum of densities on the other lanes. Our results intrinsically encompass a wide range of vehicular network scenarios, including one-way and two-way roads, as well as special cases such as road side units and/or parked cars being used as relays.},

year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Disaster area mapping is critical to guiding evacuees to safety and aiding responders in decision-making. During disasters however, Cloud-based mapping services cannot be relied upon, because network infrastructures may have been damaged. In this study, we propose a disaster area mapping system that functions under challenged-network environments in a disaster area. The system infers a pedestrian map with walking speed information from data gathered by civilians and responders with mobile devices. To generate the map, the system addresses the following challenges: how to collect disaster area data, how to share data without continuous end-to-end networks, and how to generate maps without Cloud-based mapping services. First, the system leverages human mobility to collect disaster area data. Civilians and responders with mobile devices function as sensor nodes and log their GPS and velocity traces while moving based on the Post-Disaster Mobility Model. Second, the system uses mobile devices to establish a Delay-Tolerant Network, through which nodes opportunistically share data. Finally to generate the map, the collected data are routed to Computing Nodes: devices with more computational resources than mobile devices that are spatially-distributed across the disaster area. The Computing Nodes infer the map from the data and share it with evacuees. Through experimental evaluations and computer simulations, we found that the system significantly decreases the time required to generate and deliver a map to an evacuee, compared to a case without the system. Furthermore, the overall reduction in time increases as the size of the data required to generate the map and the number of DTN nodes increase.},

abstract={Prevalence of mobile devices equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers has made available various services providing useful information related to user location. However, since users have to send location information which may reveal private information, preserving location privacy has become a significant challenge. We require an environment which enables users to enjoy the benefit of services without privacy concerns. Location privacy preservation methods should be constructed by considering the adversary's knowledge of the user's movement. In this paper, we consider time-varying distribution of population density as the adversary's knowledge to estimate user locations. We evaluated the impact of the time-varying distribution of population density on location privacy preservation level in a simulation experiment. We used a people flow data set of the Tokyo metropolitan area to obtain the time-varying distribution of population density and user location traces. The results demonstrate that the adversary is able to estimate user locations more correctly and more confidently by considering the time-varying distribution of population density. We also found a problem in terms of large dispersion of the location privacy preservation level between regions. In other words, it is hard to satisfy the criteria required by the location privacy preservation level. Given the simulation results, we suggest that considering the time-varying distribution of population density is effective for estimation of user location and degrading the performance of location privacy preservation mechanisms.},

abstract={Movement and social life of wheelchair users are constrained by their disability and suitability of paths they can move on. Modern electric wheelchairs offer them assisted drive, making their movement easier and longer. They, however, do not prevent accidents, injuries, and inconveniences caused by path roughness and ramp slopes. Providing information about suitability and accessibility of paths and buildings for wheelchair users will enable them to beforehand plan their trip to not to be caught by surprises or not to take a trip all together. The recent emergence of smartphones equipped with inertial sensors offers new opportunities for provision of information regarding quality and accessibility of paths and buildings for wheelchair users. To this end, we propose a smartphone-based participatory system incorporating a hybrid unsupervised machine learning technique based on Self Organized Maps (SOM) to identify path conditions and to create clusters of similar path types. Our solution provides useful information about the angle of the ramp and curb slopes as well as pavement quality and roughness and path types.},

As the Internet of Things (IoT) comes of age, people increasingly want to use various devices in the surrounding environment in conjunction with their smartphones. The cost of developing services that cooperate with the devices is high because various kinds of devices exist and multiple OSs for smartphones need to be supported. To mitigate the issue, we propose a dynamic device connection method that can connect services (e.g. Web applications) with devices located close to users by installing the device drivers and/or protocol adapters dynamically. Developers can create new Web applications easily because the device drivers absorb the differences of the devices and provide a common Web interface for them. The protocol adapters provide access capability to OS application programming interfaces (APIs) for Web technology. We implemented the proposed method on an Android smartphone and evaluated it with Bluetooth Low Energy devices and a Classic Bluetooth device. Results showed that the method absorbs the difference of function and protocol and delivers a reasonable performance.},

In this study, we focused on the window sizes and the sampling rates in order to observe how they affect to the accuracy and CPU utilization. For our test scenarios, we built a dataset including a tri-axial accelerometer sensor data of 7 daily activities: walking, jogging, sitting, lying, standing, walking upstairs and walking downstairs. We collected these activities with a sampling rate of 80 Hz by using 5 seconds window size. Then, we downsampled the collected data to 40 Hz, 20 Hz, 10 Hz, 5 Hz and 1 Hz by using 4, 3, 2, and 1 seconds window sizes, respectively. Thus, we could evaluate the variation of the accuracy and CPU utilization. Our test results showed that when the sampling rate increases, both the accuracy and the CPU utilization become greater. Moreover, we observed that, for a fixed sampling rate, when window size increases, CPU utilization decreases.},

abstract={Aggregation of data from multiple sensor nodes is usually done by simple methods such as averaging or, more sophisticated, iterative filtering methods. However, such aggregation methods are highly vulnerable to malicious attacks where the attacker has knowledge of all sensed values and has ability to alter some of the readings. In this work, we develop and evaluate algorithms that eliminate or minimize the influence of altered readings. The basic idea is to consider altered data as outliers and find algorithms that effectively identify altered data as outliers and remove them. Once the outliers have been removed, use some standard technique to estimate a true value. Thus, the proposed data aggregation algorithm operates in two phases: removal of outliers and computation of an estimated true value from the remaining sensor data. Extensive evaluation of the proposed algorithms shows that they significantly outperform all existing methods.},

abstract={We are on the brink of a new era, the Internet of Things. Security threats will rise with an increasing number of devices, since typical sensor nodes refrain from resource intense, seasoned security measures. Hence, we have to assume that sensor nodes will receive software updates more frequently. Particularly IP providers in the emerging market of specialized software will want their software protected during an update process. We propose a novel protocol by integrating different trust establishing techniques, to allow secure software updates on nodes already infected with malware. In short, a device has to prove the erasure of its memory within a time constraint and a physically unclonable function binds the newly downloaded software IP to the target platform. We surveyed several commercial smart home systems and analysed the security of our protocol. Compared to existing solutions, our protocol offers stronger IP protection under a more powerful attacker model, while the implementation costs are comparable to those of the existing protocols.},

abstract={IoT environments are important and challenging application domains for privacy studies, for two reasons: data collection about people is nearly invisible, and IoT environments typically do not support interfaces that allow users to specify their privacy preferences or to control the personal data collection practices of the environment. It is also well known that IoT environments present rich challenges in managing privacy choices. We present two systems that will support powerful mechanisms to embed and test a diverse set of privacy technologies in an IoT environment in a large School building.},

abstract={The ubiquity of mobile sensing devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) enables an emerging data crowdsourcing paradigm called participatory sensing, where multiple individuals collect data and use a cloud service to analyse the union of the collected data. An example of such collaborative analysis is collaborative anomaly detection. Given the possibility that the cloud service is honest but curious, a major challenge is how to protect the participants' privacy. The scheme called Random Multiparty Perturbation (RMP) addresses this challenge by allowing each participant to perturb his/her tabular data by passing the data through a nonlinear function, and projecting the data to a lower dimension using a participant-specific random matrix. Here, we propose an improvement to RMP by introducing a new nonlinear function. The improved scheme is assessed in terms of its recovery resistance to the maximum a priori (MAP) estimation attack. Experimental results and preliminary theoretical analysis indicate that RMP is resistant to collusion attacks and has better recovery resistance to MAP estimation attacks compared to the original scheme. It also achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and privacy.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) embraces the interconnection of identifiable devices that are capable of providing services through their cooperation. The cooperation among devices in such an IoT environment often requires reliable and trusted participating members in order to provide useful services to the end user. Consequently, an IoT environment or space needs to evaluate the trust levels of all devices in contact before admitting them as members of the space. Existing trust evaluation models are based on resources such as historical observations or recommendations information to evaluate the trust level of a device. However, these methods fail if there is no existing trust resource. This paper introduces a specific IoT environment called personal space IoT and proposes a novel trust evaluation model that performs a challenge-response trust assessment to evaluate the trust level of a device before allowing it to participate in the space. This novel challenge-response trust assessment model does not require the historical observation or previous encounter with the device or any existing trusted recommendation. The proposed challenge-response trust assessment model provides a reliable trust resource that can be used along with other resources such as direct trust, recommendation trust to get a comprehensive trust opinion on a specific device. It can also be considered as a new method for evaluating the trust value on a device.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) employs smart devices as its building blocks for developing a ubiquitous communication framework. It thus supports a wide variety of application domains, including public safety, healthcare, education, and public transportation. While offering a novel communication paradigm, IoT finds its requirements closely connected to the security issues. The role of security following the fact that a new type of devices known as wearables constitute an emerging area. This paper delivers an applicability study of the state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives for wearable IoT devices, including the pairing-based cryptography. Pairing-based schemes are well-recognized as fundamental enablers for many advanced cryptographic applications, such as privacy protection and identity-based encryption. To deliver a comprehensive view on the computational power of modern wearable devices (smart phones, watches, and embedded devices), we perform an evaluation of a variety of them utilizing bilinear pairing for real-time communication. In order to deliver a complete picture, the obtained bilinear pairing results are complemented with performance figures for classical cryptography (such as block ciphers, digital signatures, and hash functions). Our findings show that wearable devices of today have the needed potential to efficiently operate with cryptographic primitives in real time. Therefore, we believe that the data provided during this research would shed light on what devices are more suitable for certain cryptographic operations.},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Low cost pervasive devices such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags and sensor nodes are increasingly becoming part of the fabric of life. Using these pervasive devices to store and collect data securely is becoming a challenge because stringent requirements on power and area constrain the implementation of standard cryptographic mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight authentication protocol for resource scarce pervasive devices built upon a physical unclonable function (PUF) primitive termed Obfuscated PUF (OB-PUF) and a variant of a parameter-based authentication protocol. This protocol sends obfuscated challenges to an OB-PUF where the subsequent recovery of the obfuscated challenges by a server (verifier) is guaranteed. In particular, our approach exploits server (verifer) aided computations to reduce the hardware complexity on the pervasive device while still maintaining a high level of security and taking advantage of the known vulnerability of PUFs to model building attacks. Most importantly, the unclonability of the OB-PUF is preserved and, consequently, OB-PUF based pervasive devices are resilient to cloning. We also show through statistical analysis and model building attacks the infeasibility of constructing a model of our proposed OB-PUF by an adversary.},

abstract={The rapidly growing elderly population in many parts of the world has started to impact private and public interests - emotionally, socially and economically. Specifically, current demographics, medical and social trends in the U.S. indicate a large population of older adults being at risk of early cognitive impairment and dementia. This motivates us to design innovative technology solutions for cognitive health assessment, care and well-being in elderly people in their own environments of daily life. Among many significant challenges involved in such technology assisted solutions, an important one is multi-modal sensing and complex sensor data analytics on resource constrained wearable and regularly used daily objects, particularly in the presence of uncertainty and noisy environments. An additional critical challenge is how to transfer the extracted knowledge into actionable information to be effectively used by family members, doctors and caregivers. This keynote talk will present our ongoing research on elderly cognitive care with the help of complex at-home activities recognition with smart wearable, and user emotional behavior signatures detection with smart chair. For activity recognition, our innovative methodology is the first of its kind that detects 21 fine-grained and complex at-home activities by wearable devices, as compared to typical 6-12 at-home activities recognized by relevant works in the existing literature. The smart chair based novel framework can accurately detect user functional and emotional activities, in addition to static and movement based sedentary postures that are more common in current works. In collaboration with Phelps County Regional Medical Center, the proposed solutions are being validated with clinical data and patient studies.},

abstract={Prolonged working hours are a primary cause of stress, work related injuries (e.g, RSIs), and work-life imbalance in employees at a workplace. As reported by some studies, taking timely breaks from continuous work not only reduces stress and exhaustion but also improves productivity, employee bonding, and camaraderie. Our goal is to build a system that automatically detects breaks thereby assisting in maintaining healthy work-break balance. In this paper, we focus on detecting foosball breaks of employees at a workplace using a smartwatch. We selected foosball as it is one of the most commonly played games at many workplaces in the United States. Since playing foosball involves wrist and hand movement, a wrist-worn device (e.g., a smartwatch), due to its position, has a clear advantage over a smartphone for detecting foosball activity. Our evaluation using data collected from real workplace shows that we can identify with more than 95% accuracy whether a person is playing foosball or not. We also show that we can determine how long a foosball session lasted with an error of less than 3% in the best case.},

abstract={Wristbands have been traditionally designed to track the activities of a single person. However there is an opportunity to utilize the sensing capabilities of wristbands to offer activity tracking services within the domain of team-based sports games. In this paper we demonstrate the design of an activity tracking system capable of detecting the players' activities within a one-to-one basketball game. Relying on the inertial sensors of wristbands and smartphones, the system can capture the shooting attempts of each player and provide statistics about their performance. The system is based on a two-level classification architecture, combining data from both players in the game. We employ a technique for semi-automatic labeling of the ground truth that requires minimum manual input during a training game. Using a single game as a training dataset, and applying the classifier on future games we demonstrate that the system can achieve a good level of accuracy detecting the shooting attempts of both players in the game (precision 91.34%, recall 94.31%).},

abstract={We describe our vision of a multiple mobile or wearable device environment and share our initial exploration of our vision in multi-wrist gesture recognition. We explore how multi-device input and output might look, giving four scenarios of everyday multi-device use that show the technical challenges that need to be addressed. We describe our system which allows for recognition to be distributed between multiple devices, fusing recognition streams on a resource-rich device (e.g., mobile phone). An Interactor layer recognises common gestures from the fusion engine, and provides abstract input streams (e.g., scrolling and zooming) to user interface components called Midgets. These take advantage of multi-device input and output, and are designed to simplify the process of implementing multi-device gestural applications. Our initial exploration of multi-device gestures led us to design a modified pipelined HMM with early elimination of candidate gestures that can recognize gestures in almost 0.2 milliseconds and scales well to large numbers of gestures. Finally, we discuss the open problems in multi-device interaction and our research directions.},

abstract={The use of deep learning for the activity recognition performed by wearables, such as smartwatches, is an understudied problem. To advance current understanding in this area, we perform a smartwatch-centric investigation of activity recognition under one of the most popular deep learning methods - Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). This study includes a variety of typical behavior and context recognition tasks related to smartwatches (such as transportation mode, physical activities and indoor/outdoor detection) to which RBMs have previously never been applied. Our findings indicate that even a relatively simple RBM-based activity recognition pipeline is able to outperform a wide-range of common modeling alternatives for all tested activity classes. However, usage of deep models is also often accompanied by resource consumption that is unacceptably high for constrained devices like watches. Therefore, we complement this result with a study of the overhead of specifically RBM-based activity models on representative smartwatch hardware (the Snapdragon 400 SoC, present in many commercial smartwatches). These results show, contrary to expectation, RBM models for activity recognition have acceptable levels of resource use for smartwatch-class hardware already on the market. Collectively, these two experimental results make a strong case for more widespread adoption of deep learning techniques within smartwatch designs moving forward.},

We conduct a large scale analysis of three popular smartwatch app markets: Android Wear, Samsung, and Apple, and characterize more than 14,000 smartwatch apps in multiple aspects such as prices, number of developers and categories. Our analysis shows that approximately 41% and 30% of the apps in Android Wear and Samsung app markets are Personalization apps that provide watch faces. Further, we provide a generic taxonomy for apps on all three platforms based on their packaging and modes of communication, that allow us to investigate apps with respect to privacy and security. Finally, we study the privacy risks associated with the app usage by identifying third party trackers integrated into these apps and personal information leakage through network traffic analysis. We show that a higher percentage of Apple apps (62%) are connected to third party trackers compared to Samsung (36%) and Android Wear (46%).},

abstract={Personalization and automation in future smart vehicles hinge on accurately identifying the driver and passengers in the vehicle. Traditional approaches either require additional infrastructure or impose assumptions about how users interact with their smartphones. The recent proliferation of commercial smartwatches enables new opportunities to solve this problem due to the fixed position of the watch on the wrist. We use this observation to motivate WatchUDrive, our smartwatch-based application for identifying whether the wearer is the driver or a passenger in a vehicle. We evaluate two smartwatch sensing modalities for driver vs. passenger differentiation: the accelerometer and the camera. Using 40 in-vehicle episodes collected from 8 users and 8 different vehicles, we show that the accelerometer yields 90% accuracy within 10 seconds, whereas the camera only yields 62% accuracy within 110 seconds.},
