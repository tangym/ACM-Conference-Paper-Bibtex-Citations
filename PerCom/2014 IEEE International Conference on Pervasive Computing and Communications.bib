With IoT, physical objects should be seamlessly integrated into an Internet-like system so that the physical objects and cyber-agents can interact each other in order to achieve mission-critical objectives. Given its tremendous application potential, IoT has become popular in recent years, attracting great attentions from both academic research and industrial development. In this talk, we will first focus on fundamental issues related to IoT. We address principles that should guide research and development of IoT. We will then present several approaches that may lead to implementation of IoT and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We will show an implementation of IoT called “WInternet” and demonstrate its application. Finally, we will discuss critical issues that must be addressed in order to fully realize the objectives and potentials of IoT.},

volume={},

pages={2-10}, 
abstract={Kintense is a robust, accurate, real-time, and evolving system for detecting aggressive actions such as hitting, kicking, pushing, and throwing from streaming 3D skeleton joint coordinates obtained from Kinect sensors. Kintense uses a combination of: (1) an array of supervised learners to recognize a predefined set of aggressive actions, (2) an unsupervised learner to discover new aggressive actions or refine existing actions, and (3) human feedback to reduce false alarms and to label potential aggressive actions. This paper describes the design and implementation of Kintense and provides empirical evidence that the system is 11% - 16% more accurate and 10% - 54% more robust to changes in distance, body orientation, speed, and person when compared to standard techniques such as dynamic time warping (DTW) and posture based gesture recognizers. We deploy Kintense in two multi-person households and demonstrate how it evolves to discover and learn unseen actions, achieves up to 90% accuracy, runs in real-time, and reduces false alarms with up to 13 times fewer user interactions than a typical system.},

title={Nonparametric discovery of human routines from sensor data}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={11-19}, 
abstract={People engage in routine behaviors. Automatic routine discovery goes beyond low-level activity recognition such as sitting or standing and analyzes human behaviors at a higher level (e.g., commuting to work). With recent developments in ubiquitous sensor technologies, it becomes easier to acquire a massive amount of sensor data. One main line of research is to mine human routines from sensor data using parametric topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation. The main shortcoming of parametric models is that it assumes a fixed, pre-specified parameter regardless of the data. Choosing an appropriate parameter usually requires an inefficient trial-and-error model selection process. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find optimal parameter values in advance for personalized applications. In this paper, we present a novel nonparametric framework for human routine discovery that can infer high-level routines without knowing the number of latent topics beforehand. Our approach is evaluated on public datasets in two routine domains: a 34-daily-activity dataset and a transportation mode dataset. Experimental results show that our nonparametric framework can automatically learn the appropriate model parameters from sensor data without any form of model selection procedure and can outperform traditional parametric approaches for human routine discovery tasks.},

year={2014}, 
volume={},

pages={20-28}, 
abstract={Exploiting context from stream data in pervasive environments remains a challenge. We aim to extract proximal context from Bluetooth stream data, using an incremental, Bayesian nonparametric framework that estimates the number of contexts automatically. Unlike current approaches that can only provide final proximal grouping, our method provides proximal grouping and membership of users over time. Additionally, it provides an efficient online inference. We construct co-location matrix over time using Bluetooth data. A Poisson-exponential model is used to factorize this matrix into a factor matrix, interpreted as proximal groups, and a coefficient matrix that indicates factor usage. The coefficient matrix follows the Indian Buffet Process prior, which estimates the number of factors automatically. The non-negativity and sparsity of factors are enforced by using the exponential distribution to generate the factors. We propose a fixed-lag particle filter algorithm to process data incrementally. We compare the incremental inference (particle filter) with full batch inference (Gibbs sampling) in terms of normalized factorization error and execution time. The normalized error obtained through our incremental inference is comparable to that of full batch inference, whilst the execution time is more than 100 times faster. The discovered factors have similar meaning to the results of the popular Louvain method for community detection.},

title={Using rule mining to understand appliance energy consumption patterns}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={29-37}, 
abstract={Managing energy in the home is key to creating a sustainable future for our society. More tools are increasingly available to measure home energy usage, however these tools provide little insight into questions such as why an appliance consumes more energy than normal or what kinds of behavioral changes might be most likely to reduce energy usage in the home. To answer these questions, a deeper understanding of the causal factors that influence energy usage is necessary. In this work, we conduct a broad study of factors that influence energy consumption of individual devices in the home. Our first contribution is collection of a context-rich data set from six homes across the United States. The second contribution of this work is a set of insights into key factors influencing energy usage derived by the novel application of a rule mining algorithm to identify significant associations between energy usage and four key features: hour of the day, day of the week, use of other appliances in the home, and user-supplied annotations of activities such as working or cooking. Our analysis confirms our hypothesis that, though most devices show a regular pattern of daily or weekly use, this is not true for all devices. Associations that relate use of two different devices in the same home are often stronger, and are observed for nearly 25% of device uses. Overall, we observe that the associations derived from the first five weeks of data in our data set are sufficient to explain nearly 70% of the device uses in the subsequent five weeks of data, and over 90% of the associations identified during the first five weeks recur in the latter portion of the data set. The associations identified by our approach may be used to to aid in end-user applications that heighten awareness and encourage energy savings, improve energy disaggregation algorithms, or even detect anomalous uses that may signal problems in aging-in-place homes.},

abstract={A significant amount of energy is wasted by electrical appliances when they operate inefficiently either due to anomalies and/or incorrect usage. To address this problem, we present SocketWatch - an autonomous appliance monitoring system. SocketWatch is positioned between a wall socket and an appliance. SocketWatch learns the behavioral model of the appliance by analyzing its active and reactive power consumption patterns. It detects appliance malfunctions by observing any marked deviations from these patterns. SocketWatch is inexpensive and is easy to use: it neither requires any enhancement to the appliances nor to the power sockets nor any communication infrastructure. Moreover, the decentralized approach avoids communication latency and costs, and preserves data privacy. Real world experiments with multiple appliances indicate that SocketWatch can be an effective and inexpensive solution for reducing electricity wastage.},

abstract={The goal of energy monitoring and eco-feedback systems is to induce energy consumers to change their behaviors to achieve a more sustainable way of life. Comprehensive research and commercial solutions provide energy consumers with information about overall energy costs or appliance-level energy usage. However, in order to better promote spontaneous energy saving with an eco-feedback system, personalized information is required. The conventional solutions cannot identify the energy usage of an individual user in a shared residential environment. In this paper, we propose the Personalized Energy Auditor, which estimates personal energy usage at home. Our system monitors and analyzes appliance usage, as well as the energy cost of the daily activities of residents. The system then estimates personal energy usage automatically, by linking appliance usage data with the individual user. Our system was installed in residential homes, and the experimental results indicate that it accurately estimates personal energy usage.},

pages={50-50}, 
abstract={Summary form only given. Automotive customers' expectations have significantly changed in the past decade. They are influenced by new technologies such as the high-bandwith mobile Internet and increasingly capable mobile consumer electronics devices. At the same time, urbanization and the necessity for ecological sustainability provoke new demands. Internet based communities are drivers for a developing Shareconomy. It is evident that that the conventional car, whether it is the all mechanical Auto 1.0 or the electronics and driving assistance systems loaded Auto 2.0, will not be able to meet these expectations and demands. The upcoming Auto 3.0 is no longer mobility hardware, but instead integral part of a seamless intermodal mobility chain for individuals. It is connected with the surrounding environment and other modes of transport. It is capable of understanding the mobility requirements of the individual, and it delivers the right information at the right time in order to make the right decisions. For this to work, the Auto 3.0 will need access to all sorts of data that is always current, comprehensive, filtered, and geographically referenced. Important enabling technologies are cross-OEM crowd sourcing of data as well as processing and real-time data analytics in the cloud. The vehicle finally becomes part of the Internet of Things. Benefits that can already today be achieved are for example traffic jam avoidance by enrichment of the navigation map with relevant real-time traffic flow information, reduction of CO2 emissions by anticipatory adaption of engines, power train and recuperation, and extension of the mileage of electric vehicles. The next steps are to open up the systems and to establish market places for the interconnection of different services. Traditionally, the Internet of Things, services realized by combining sensors, computing backends, and apps are part of a single offering and cannot be combined with other services. Platforms such as IFTT- , on the other hand, connect different ecosystems and enable a new class of services. Especially the Auto 3.0 will benefit from such an open platform which allows the implementation of multiplicity of connected and location-based services including data from numerous systems, operators, and stakeholders. Additional potentials in efficiency for future smart cities can be realized by this interconnection of different systems and participants such as vehicles, buildings, urban administration, and utilities. Establishing such a platform is an important objective.},

abstract={We propose a novel pervasive system to recognise human daily activities from a wearable device. The system is designed in a form of reading glasses, named `Smart Glasses', integrating a 3-axis accelerometer and a first-person view camera. Our aim is to classify user's activities of daily living (ADLs) based on both vision and head motion data. This ego-activity recognition system not only allows caretakers to track on a specific person (such as patient or elderly people), but also has the potential to remind/warn people with cognitive impairments of hazardous situations. We present the following contributions in this paper: a feature extraction method from accelerometer and video; a classification algorithm integrating both locomotive (body motions) and stationary activities (without or with small motions); a novel multi-scale dynamic graphical model structure for structured classification over time. We collect, train and validate our system on a large dataset containing 20 hours of ADLs data, including 12 daily activities under different environmental settings. Our method improves the classification performance (F-Score) of conventional approaches from 43.32%(video features) and 66.02%(acceleration features) by an average of 20-40% to 84.45%, with an overall accuracy of 90.04% in realistic ADLs.},

year={2014}, 
volume={},

pages={60-68}, 
abstract={Commercial and residential buildings are usually instrumented with meters and sensors that are deployed as part of a utility infrastructure installed by companies that provide services such as electricity, water, gas, security, phone, etc. As part of their normal operation, these service providers have direct access to information from the sensors and meters. A concern arises that the sensory information collected by the providers, although coarse-grained, can be subject to analysis that reveals private information about the users of the building. Oftentimes, multiple services are provided by the same company, in which case the potential for leakage of private information increases. Our research seeks to investigate the extent to which easily available sensory information may be used by external service providers to make occupancy-related inferences. Particularly, we focus on inferences from two different sources: motion sensors, which are installed and monitored by security companies, and smart electric meters, which are deployed by electric companies for billing and demand-response management. We explore the motion sensor scenario in a three-person single-family home and the electric meter scenario in a twelve-person university lab. Our exploration with various inference methods shows that sensory information available to service providers can enable them to make undesired occupancy related inferences, such as levels of occupancy or even the identities of current occupants, significantly better than naive prediction strategies that do not make use of sensor information.},

title={Pushing the spatio-temporal resolution limit of urban air pollution maps}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={69-77}, 
abstract={Up-to-date information on urban air pollution is of great importance for health protection agencies to assess air quality and provide advice to the general public in a timely manner. In particular, ultrafine particles (UFPs) are widely spread in urban environments and may have a severe impact on human health. However, the lack of knowledge about the spatio-temporal distribution of UFPs hampers profound evaluation of these effects. In this paper, we analyze one of the largest spatially resolved UFP data set publicly available today containing over 25 million measurements. We collected the measurements throughout more than a year using mobile sensor nodes installed on top of public transport vehicles in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Based on these data, we develop land-use regression models to create pollution maps with a high spatial resolution of 100m × 100 m. We compare the accuracy of the derived models across various time scales and observe a rapid drop in accuracy for maps with subweekly temporal resolution. To address this problem, we propose a novel modeling approach that incorporates past measurements annotated with metadata into the modeling process. In this way, we achieve a 26% reduction in the root-mean-square error-a standard metric to evaluate the accuracy of air quality models-of pollution maps with semi-daily temporal resolution. We believe that our findings can help epidemiologists to better understand the adverse health effects related to UFPs and serve as a stepping stone towards detailed real-time pollution assessment.},

Our primary objective is to construct a spatio-temporal social graph from noisy proximity data. We address the technical and algorithmic challenges of measuring proximity reliably and accurately. Simulations and real world experiments demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of our approach. Our algorithms doubles the sensitivity of proximity detections at the cost of a slight reduction in specificity.},

title={A refined limit on the predictability of human mobility}, 
year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={88-94}, 
abstract={It has been recently claimed that human movement is highly predictable. While an upper bound of 93% predictability was shown, this was based upon human movement trajectories of very high spatiotemporal granularity. Recent studies reduced this spatiotemporal granularity down to the level of GPS data, and under a similar methodology results once again suggested a high predictability upper bound (i.e. 90% when movement was quantized down to a spatial resolution approximately the size of a large building). In this work we reconsider the derivation of the upper bound to movement predictability. By considering real-world topological constraints we are able to achieve a tighter upper bound, representing a more refined limit to the predictability of human movement. Our results show that this upper bound is between 11-24% less than previously claimed at a spatial resolution of approx. 100m×100m, with a greater improvement for finer spatial resolutions. This indicates that human mobility is potentially less predictable than previously thought. We provide an in-depth examination of how varying the spatial and temporal quantization affects predictability, and consider the impact of corresponding limits using a large set of real-world GPS traces. Particularly at fine-grained spatial quantizations, where a significant number of practical applications lie, these new (lower) upper limits raise serious questions about the use of location information alone for prediction, contributing more evidence that such prediction must integrate external variables.},

abstract={People counting is key to a diverse set of sensing applications. In this paper, we design a mote-scale event-driven solution that uses a low-power pulsed radar to estimate the number of people within the ~10m radial range of the radar. In contrast to extant solutions, most of which use computer vision, our solution is light-weight and private. It also better tolerates the presence of obstacles that partially or fully impair line of sight; this is achieved by accounting for “small” indirect radio reflections via joint time-frequency domain features. The counter itself is realized using Support Vector Regression; the regression map is learned from a medium sized dataset of 0-~40 people in various indoor room settings. 10-fold cross validation of our counter yields a mean absolute error of 2.17 between the estimated count and the ground truth and a correlation coefficient of 0.97.We compare the performance of our solution with baseline counters.},

abstract={Participatory sensing produces incomplete sensor data. Thus, we have to fill in the gaps of any missing values in the sensor data in order to provide sensor-based services. We propose a method to estimate a missing value of incomplete sensor data. It accurately estimates a missing value by repeating two processes: selecting sensors locally correlated with the sensor that includes the missing value and then updating the training sensor dataset that consist of data from the selected sensors available for multiple regression. This procedure effectively helps to find more suitable neighbor records of a query record from the training sensor dataset and to refine the regression model using the records. It overcomes three problems that other estimation methods have: a decrease in the amount of available training sensor dataset due to missing values, the difficulty in finding similar records of a query due to the “curse of dimensionality,” and the complexity in formalizing the estimation model due to “overfitting.” The main feature of our method is the way it repeatedly prunes inessential sensors while exploiting the anti-monotone property in which the training sensor dataset R' that consist of the sensors V' ⊂ V is larger than the data R that consist of V. Empirical evaluations done using public datasets in which we appended missing values show that our method increases the training sensor dataset for estimation and improves estimation accuracy through repeated sensor selections. Furthermore, we confirmed through a field trial and a life-log enrichment trial, that our method was effective for estimating missing sensor values in a participatory sensing environment.},

abstract={Cameras are ubiquitous and increasingly being used not just for capturing images but also for communicating information. For example, the pervasive QR codes can be viewed as communicating a short code to camera-equipped sensors and recent research has explored using screen-to-camera communications for larger data transfers. Such communications could be particularly attractive in pervasive camera based applications, where such camera communications can reuse the existing camera hardware and also leverage from the large pixel array structure for high data-rate communication. While several prototypes have been constructed, the fundamental capacity limits of this novel communication channel in all but the simplest scenarios remains unknown. The visual medium differs from RF in that the information capacity of this channel largely depends on the perspective distortions while multipath becomes negligible. In this paper, we create a model of this communication system to allow predicting the capacity based on receiver perspective (distance and angle to the transmitter). We calibrate and validate this model through lab experiments wherein information is transmitted from a screen and received with a tablet camera. Our capacity estimates indicate that tens of Mbps is possible using a smartphone camera even when the short code on the screen images onto only 15% of the camera frame. Our estimates also indicate that there is room for at least 2.5x improvement in throughput of existing screen - camera communication prototypes.},

abstract={Mobile wallets promise a future where users do not need to carry physical payment cards. However, the slow adoption of contactless point of sales (POS) terminals by merchants limits the potential of Near-Field Communication (NFC) based payment devices. In this paper, we present Wild Card, a secure and backward compatible solution for making mobile payments at conventional magnetic stripe based POS terminals. Our solution resembles a traditional credit card in its physical dimensions and stays in the phone case. It can be programmatically set by an NFC-enabled mobile phone to any card number that the user owns. The key technologies that enable Wild Card are a fully programmable magnetic stripe, an energy harvesting system that allows the card to be charged and programmed by the phone through NFC, and a security mechanism that makes card information resilient to attacks on mobile devices. With a prototype, we evaluate the feasibility of Wild Card in terms of functionality and energy budget.},

year={2014},

pages={130-138}, 
abstract={The optimization of logistics in large building complexes with many resources, such as hospitals, require realistic facility management and planning. Current planning practices rely foremost on manual observations or coarse unverified assumptions and therefore do not properly scale or provide realistic data to inform facility planning. In this paper, we propose analysis methods to extract knowledge from large sets of network collected WiFi traces to better inform facility management and planning in large building complexes. The analysis methods, which build on a rich set of temporal and spatial features, include methods for noise removal, e.g., labeling of beyond building-perimeter devices, and methods for quantification of area densities and flows, e.g., building enter and exit events, and for classifying the behavior of people, e.g., into user roles such as visitor, hospitalized or employee. Spatio-temporal visualization tools built on top of these methods enable planners to inspect and explore extracted information to inform facility-planning activities. To evaluate the methods, we present results for a large hospital complex covering more than 10 hectares. The evaluation is based on WiFi traces collected in the hospital's WiFi infrastructure over two weeks observing around 18000 different devices recording more than a billion individual WiFi measurements. For the presented analysis methods we present quantitative performance results, e.g., demonstrating over 95% accuracy for correct noise removal of beyond building perimeter devices. We furthermore present detailed statistics from our analysis regarding people's presence, movement and roles, and example types of visualizations that both highlight their potential as inspection tools for planners and provide interesting insights into the test-bed hospital.},

year={2014}, 
volume={},

pages={139-147}, 
abstract={While location-based services are already well established in outdoor scenarios, they are still not available in indoor environments. The reason for this can be found in two open problems: First, there is still no off-the-shelf indoor positioning system for mobile devices and, second, indoor maps are not publicly available for most buildings. While there is an extensive body of work on the first problem, the efficient creation of indoor maps remains an open challenge. We tackle the indoor mapping challenge in our MapGENIE approach that automatically derives indoor maps from traces collected by pedestrians moving around in a building. Since the trace data is collected in the background from the pedestrians' mobile devices, MapGENIE avoids the labor-intensive task of traditional indoor map creation and increases the efficiency of indoor mapping. To enhance the map building process, MapGENIE leverages exterior information about the building and uses grammars to encode structural information about the building. Hence, in contrast to existing work, our approach works without any user interaction and only needs a small amount of traces to derive the indoor map of a building. To demonstrate the performance of MapGENIE, we implemented our system using Android and a foot-mounted IMU to collect traces from volunteers. We show that using our grammar approach, compared to a purely trace-based approach we can identify up to four times as many rooms in a building while at the same time achieving a consistently lower error in the size of detected rooms.},

We discuss challenges and lessons learned for the design of such a system on a mobile phone and propose appropriate features to extract activity characteristics from RSSI. We demonstrate the feasibility of recognising activities, gestures and environmental situations from RSSI obtained by a mobile phone. The case studies were conducted over a period of about two months in which about 12 hours of continuous RSSI data was sampled, in two countries and with 11 participants in total. Results demonstrate the potential to utilise RSSI for the extension of the environmental perception of a mobile device as well as for the interaction with touch-free gestures. The system achieves an accuracy of 0.51 while distinguishing as many as 11 gestures and can reach 0.72 on average for four more disparate ones.},

abstract={Wi-Fi based localization has proven to be a compelling alternative to GPS for mobile devices. But Wi-Fi scanning consumes a large amount of energy on smartphones because they perform full scans, i.e. all the channels in their band(s) are visited. This inefficient behavior greatly reduces battery life, raising the threshold for user acceptance. We propose a novel, incremental approach that reduces the energy consumption of Wi-Fi localization by scanning just a few selected channels. We evaluate our incremental scanning approach on eight Android devices using traces from five test subjects. Our results show that, compared to full scans, incremental scanning can reduce the energy consumption between 20.64% and 57.79%. The modern smartphones included in our study all show an energy reduction of at least 40%.},

year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={163-171}, 
abstract={Zero-Interaction Authentication (ZIA) refers to approaches that authenticate a user to a verifier (terminal) without any user interaction. Currently deployed ZIA solutions are predominantly based on the terminal detecting the proximity of the user's personal device, or a security token, by running an authentication protocol over a short-range wireless communication channel. Unfortunately, this simple approach is highly vulnerable to low-cost and practical relay attacks which completely offset the usability benefits of ZIA. The use of contextual information, gathered via on-board sensors, to detect the co-presence of the user and the verifier is a recently proposed mechanism to resist relay attacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate the performance of different sensor modalities for co-presence detection with respect to a standard Dolev-Yao adversary. First, using a common data collection framework run in realistic everyday settings, we compare the performance of four commonly available sensor modalities (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, and Audio) in resisting ZIA relay attacks, and find that WiFi is better than the rest. Second, we show that, compared to any single modality, fusing multiple modalities improves resilience against ZIA relay attacks while retaining a high level of usability. Third, we motivate the need for a stronger adversarial model to characterize an attacker who can compromise the integrity of context sensing itself. We show that in the presence of such a powerful attacker, each individual sensor modality offers very low security. Positively, the use of multiple sensor modalities improves security against such an attacker if the attacker cannot compromise multiple modalities simultaneously.},

abstract={As mobile context-aware services gain mainstream popularity, there is increased interest in developing techniques that can detect anomalous activities for applications such as user authentication, adaptive assist technologies and remote elder-care monitoring. Existing approaches have limited applicability as they regularly poll power-hungry sensors (e.g., accelerometer, GPS) reducing the availability of devices to perform anomaly detection. This paper present SALCS (Soft Authentication with Low-Cost Signatures), an approach for anomaly detection on a user's routine comprised of a collection of anomaly detection techniques utilizing soft-sensor data (e.g., call-logs, messages) and radio channel information (e.g., GSM cell IDs), all of which are available as part of a phone's routine usage. Using these information sources we model aspects of a person's routine, such as movement, messaging and conversation patterns. We present extensive evaluations of the individual anomaly detection techniques, compare the collection SALCS to an existing power-hungry approach showing SALCS has a 7.6% higher detection rate and gives 5x better coverage throughout the day.},

year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={181-189}, 
abstract={Secure device pairing is a widely studied problem. Local wireless connections such as Bluetooth and WiFi typically rely on user-entered secret keys or manually verified authentication codes. Several recent proposals replace these with contextual or location-dependent sensor inputs, which are assumed to be secret from anyone not present at the location where the pairing takes place. These protocols have to cope with a fuzzy secret, i.e. noisy secret input that differs between the devices. In this paper, we overview such protocols and propose a new variation using time-based opening of commitments. Our protocol has the advantage of treating the fuzzy secret as one piece of data rather than requiring it to be partitioned into time intervals, and being more robust against variations in input entropy than those based on error correction codes. The protocol development is motivated by the discovery of a novel human source for the fuzzy secret: synchronized drawing with two fingers of the same hand on two touch screens or surfaces. Metrics for measuring the distance between the drawings are described and evaluated. We implement a prototype of this surprisingly simple and natural pairing mechanism and show that it accurately differentiates between true positives and man-in-the-middle attackers.},

year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={190-198}, 
abstract={Recommender systems suggesting venues offer very useful services to people on the move and a great business opportunity for advertisers. These systems suggest venues by matching the current context of the user with the venue features, and consider the popularity of venues, based on the number of visits (“check-ins”) that they received. Check-ins may be explicitly communicated by users to geo-social networks, or implicitly derived by analysing location data collected by mobile services. In general, the visibility of explicit check-ins is limited to friends in the social network, while the visibility of implicit check-ins limited to the service provider. Exposing check-ins to unauthorized users is a privacy threat since recurring presence in given locations may reveal political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation, as well as absence from other locations where the user is supposed to be. Hence, on one side mobile app providers host valuable information that recommender system providers would like to buy and use to improve their systems, and on the other we recognize serious privacy issues in releasing that information. In this paper, we solve this dilemma by providing formal privacy guarantees to users and trusted mobile providers while preserving the utility of check-in information for recommendation purposes. Our technique is based on the use of differential privacy methods integrated with a pre-filtering process, and protects against both an untrusted recommender system and its users, willing to infer the venues and sensitive locations visited by other users. Extensive experiments with a large dataset of real users' check-ins show the effectiveness of our methods.},

year={2014}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={199-207}, 
abstract={Participatory Sensing (PS) is a new data collection paradigm based on the voluntary participation of many cellular users equipped with smart applications, a large diversity of sensors, and Internet connectivity at all times. Although many PS-based applications can be foreseen to solve interesting and useful problems, many of them have not been fully implemented and used in practice because of privacy concerns. Compounding the problem, privacy-preserving mechanisms introduce additional issues. For example, one of the most important problems is that of the quality of the information provided by the PS system to the final users. The problem is that, in order to protect the privacy of the users, most privacy-preserving mechanisms modify their real locations, which makes the reported data as if it had been measured from a different location, introducing noise or false information in the system and to the final users. Another important problem is that of the energy consumption. Privacy-preserving mechanisms consume extra energy and users are not very willing to use PS applications if they drain their batteries considerably faster. This paper proposes a hybrid privacy-preserving mechanism that combines anonymization, data obfuscation, and encryption techniques to increase the quality of information and privacy protection without increasing the energy consumption in a significant manner. A new algorithm is proposed that dynamically changes the cell sizes of the grid of the area of interest according to the variability of the variable of interest being measured and chooses different privacy-preserving mechanisms depending on the size of the cell. In small cells, where users can be identified easier, the algorithm uses encryption techniques to protect the privacy of the users and increase the quality of the information, as the reported location is the real location. On the other hand, anonymization and data obfuscation techniques are used in bigger cells where the variabilit- of the variable of interest is low and therefore it is more important to protect the real location (privacy) of the user. We evaluated our hybrid approach and other privacy-preserving mechanisms using a real PS system for air pollution monitoring. Our experiments show the better performance of the proposed hybrid mechanism and the existing trade-offs in terms of privacy, quality of information to the final user, and energy consumption.},

year={2014}, 
volume={},

pages={208-215}, 
abstract={Electric utilities are rapidly deploying smart meters that record and transmit electricity usage in real-time. As prior research shows, smart meter data indirectly leaks sensitive, and potentially valuable, information about a home's activities. An important example of the sensitive information smart meters reveal is occupancy-whether or not someone is home and when. As prior work also shows, occupancy is surprisingly easy to detect, since it highly correlates with simple statistical metrics, such as power's mean, variance, and range. Unfortunately, prior research that uses chemical energy storage, e.g., batteries, to prevent appliance power signature detection is prohibitively expensive when applied to occupancy detection. To address this problem, we propose preventing occupancy detection using the thermal energy storage of large elastic heating loads already present in many homes, such as electric water and space heaters. In essence, our approach, which we call Combined Heat and Privacy (CHPr), controls the power usage of these large loads to make it look like someone is always home. We design a CHPr-enabled water heater that regulates its energy usage to mask occupancy without violating its objective, e.g., to provide hot water on demand, and evaluate it in simulation and using a prototype. Our results show that a 50-gallon CHPr-enabled water heater decreases the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (a standard measure of a binary classifier's performance) of a threshold-based occupancy detection attack in a representative home by 10x (from 0.44 to 0.045), effectively preventing occupancy detection at no extra cost.},
