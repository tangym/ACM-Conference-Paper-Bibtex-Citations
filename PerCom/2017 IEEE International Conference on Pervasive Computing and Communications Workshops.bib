pages={1-2}, 
abstract={The main goal of the WristSense 2017 workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to share innovative ideas, discuss challenges, and brainstorm potential solutions to open research problems related to the domain of wrist-worn smart devices. Recently there has been a growing interest in consumerization of wrist-worn devices especially smart watches and wrist bands. Many large corporations such as Samsung and Apple already have a commodity smart watch and many other companies such as FitBit, Nike, Jawbone have wristbands geared towards fitness tracking. Smart-watches and wristbands are equipped with many sensors, (for example, latest Samsung Gear devices have heart rate, accelerometer, gyroscope, infrared sensors etc.) a processor, communication radios (for example, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) and a small size display. It is, therefore, possible to capture information about the device user, perform computation and communication using these devices to infer various activities/contexts of the user. Further, they also present a perfect platform to understand human activity and behavior and provide feedback. Moreover, compared to smartphones, wrist-worn smart devices provide richer information about certain user activities (e.g., eating, typing, and sleeping) due to their form factor. In most cases, a smart-watch is also connected to a powerful smartphone, which could help in drawing many interesting inferences by combining data from both these devices.},

year={2017}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-2}, 
abstract={With ubiquitous systems relying more and more on large datasets for designing and testing models of users' activities, the process of data labelling is becoming a major concern for the community. Labelling user data is a central part of the design and evaluation of pervasive systems that aim to support the user through situation-aware reasoning. It is essential both in designing and training the system, either through the definition of a suitable situation model in knowledge-driven applications, or though the preparation of training data for learning tasks in data-driven models. Hence, the quality of annotations can have a significant impact on the performance of the derived systems. Labelling is also vital for validating and quantifying the performance of applications. In particular, comparative evaluations require the production of benchmark datasets based on high-quality and consistent annotations. The 1st International Workshop on Annotation of useR Data for UbiquitOUs Systems (ARDUOUS) focuses on. (1) the role and impact of annotations in designing ubiquitous applications, (2) the process of labelling, and the requirements to produce high quality annotations, and (3) tools and automated methods for annotating user data. The goal of the workshop is to bring these three topics to the attention of researchers from interdisciplinary backgrounds, and to initiate a reflection on possible resolutions of the related problems.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is a novel design paradigm, envisioned as a network of billions or trillions of machines communicating with one another and rapidly gaining global attention from academia, industry, and government. Pervasive computing is at the heart of IoT and forms a fundamental building block necessary to realize the IoT. Equipped with pervasive technologies such as RFID and ‘smart dust’ in addition to sensors, actuators and machine-to-machine devices, IoT has the potential to offer innovative solutions to global challenges faced by ageing populations, climate change, growing cost of healthcare as well as how we manage our environment and natural resources. The heterogeneous nature of the IoT as well as the computational constraints of many of the building blocks of the IoT make security, privacy and trust a challenging problem to solve on the one hand, while security, privacy and trust play a critical role for most if not all applications of IoT in domains such as surveillance, healthcare, security, transport, food safety, manufacturing, logistics and supply chain management. Without effective solutions for security, privacy and trust reliable data fusion and mining, qualified services with context-aware intelligence and enhanced user acceptance and experience cannot be achieved.},

While edge devices generate a vast amount of valuable data, the same devices also offer a massive infrastructure for computing. For example, it is expected that the collective computing and storage capacity of smartphones will surpass all worldwide servers by 2017. Moreover, the explosion of edge devices coupled with a growing proliferation of cloud-based applications requires a new breed of intelligent edge computing infrastructures to deliver optimal performance to a variety of users, devices and applications sharing the network edge.},

volume={},

pages={2-5}, 
abstract={Pedestrians globally comprise 22 % of all road traffic deaths in 2013. Various approaches for reducing accident numbers have already been introduced and are still being researched. Most of these approaches have specific limitations, like requiring line of sight. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Wireless Seat Belt (WSB), a smartphone-based collision avoidance system for pedestrians. Unlike other systems, the WSB uses context information, obtained from a pedestrian's smartphone, not only as additional information but also for using the information to improve the collision detection accuracy. The WSB introduces independent, individual modules for recognizing the pedestrian's direction, position, and speed. We first evaluate the influence of the measurement errors of each module on the missed alarm probability in a typical urban collision scenario using a simulator. Then, the impact of using the pedestrian's context to decrease the missed alarm probability is evaluated. The evaluation is done using the example of a curb detection module. The curb detection is used to infer that the pedestrian has stepped onto the street to correct the pedestrian's position. The results show a decrease of the missed alarm probability by 46.5 % in the scenario considered.},

abstract={This paper explores the possibility of turning the cellular radio modem into a passive body motion sensor. Sensing is herein based on the real-time analysis of cellular radio propagation. Unlike WiFi and Bluetooth, all cellular radios are never disconnected as, even in idle mode state, they perform continuous and autonomous measurements of the propagation conditions, namely the cellular signal quality (CSQ). CSQ is constantly updated while searching for any opportunity to reselect a new camped cell and being responsive to paging operations. Body movements in the surrounding of a cellular device are responsible of small but characteristic variations of the CSQ dynamics that might also trigger new reselections. Preliminary experiments are presented based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smart-phone devices. The use of data analytics tools applied to cellular signals is a new topic that has the potential of opening up new research opportunities.},

abstract={Nutrition related health conditions can seriously decrease quality of life; a system able to monitor the kitchen activities and eating behaviour of patients could provide clinicians with important indicators for improving a patient's condition. To achieve this, the system has to reason about the person's actions and goals. To address this challenge, we present a behaviour recognition approach that relies on symbolic behaviour representation and probabilistic reasoning to recognise the person's actions, the type of meal being prepared and its potential impact on a patient's health. We test our approach on a cooking dataset containing unscripted kitchen activities recorded with various sensors in a real kitchen. The results show that the approach is able to recognise the sequence of executed actions and the prepared meal, to determine whether it is healthy, and to reason about the possibility of depression based on the type of meal.},

In the case of the formal assessment, which is the first case to be implemented, ClassAct can detect signs of academic dishonesty, as well.

abstract={The problem of collecting, processing, and learning from high-volume mobile device data has become an active research area in recent years. Time series data on application usage, in particular promises to provide fine-grained information on individual activity patterns, but currently poses collection and analysis challenges. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated system which can cheaply and easily collect application behavior and survey data from mobile phones; we introduce several novel features that assist the learning of individual level demographic features (e.g., gender and age group). Specifically, our approach for learning and inference for demographic features involves new techniques: (i) decomposing the app usage from mobile phones using spectral methods; (ii) learning spectral characteristics associated with individuals using a training set; (iii) combining other temporal features with learned spectral characteristics to predict demographic features for out-of-sample individuals. The core of our methodology is the utilization of spectral features in cell phone app activity series, allowing both identification of behavior patterns arising from particular types of cell phone apps and leveraging of those patterns for demographic classification and prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an application to real mobile app traffic data from the United States.},

We measure radio characteristics in these environments at different days and times and analyse the impact of variations in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) on the accuracy of DFAR emotion and activity recognition. In a case study with 5 subjects, we then find critical SNR values under which activity and emotion recognition results are no longer reliable.},

abstract={In recent years emerging ride-on-demand services (eg., Uber or Didi) are penetrating into the market of traditional taxi service. In these new services mobile devices are a key enabler: they serve as the intermediary between passengers/drivers and the service provider, tracking the locations and behavior of both passengers and drivers. On the other hand, the use of mobile devices also help us to capture huge amount of data for analysis. Through collaboration with a leading service provider in China, we collect vast amount of accurate data and analyze, in this paper, passenger reaction to dynamic prices in such a service. We consider the analysis as an important step towards making the service more efficient and more attractive to the passengers. We present the patterns of passengers' reaction, and discuss if it is useful to estimate the trip fare for multiple times in order to get a lower price. Our findings pave the way for future study on system optimization and policy considerations.},

abstract={In this paper, we analyse first-person-view videos to develop a personalized user authentication mechanism. Our proposed algorithm generates provisional image-based passwords which benefit a variety of purposes such as unlocking a mobile device or fallback authentication. First, representative frames are extracted from the egocentric videos. Then, they are split into distinguishable segments before a clustering procedure is applied to discard repetitive scenes. The whole process aims to retain memorable images to form the authentication challenges. We integrate eye tracking data to select informative sequences of video frames and suggest another alternative method if an eye-facing camera is not available. To evaluate our system, we perform experiments in different settings including object-interaction activities and traveling contexts. Even though our mechanism produces variable graphical passwords, the log-in effort for the user is comparable with approaches based on static challenges. We verified the authentication scheme in the presence of an informed attacker and observed that the effort is significantly higher than that of the legitimate user.},

abstract={Future power networks are supposed to contain various power sources in mesh-like structures, including distributed generations such as solar panels, wind power generations, and electric vehicles (EVs) that work not only as transportation but as huge batteries. These power sources have their own characteristics such as cost, stability, amounts of CO2 emission, etc. Hence it is desired to use them efficiently in a way suited for various characteristics of power consuming devices; for example, a desktop computer should be supplied with power from sufficiently stable power sources such as a commercial power source, while a laptop computer with a battery may accepts less stable power from natural power sources. In the concept of Energy-on-Demand (EoD), Quality-of-Energy (QoEn) power routing has been proposed to realize end-to-end power routing between power sources and power consuming device for efficient use of various power sources to optimize power allocation.

The VIPS system integrates installed surveillance cameras with the IoT to provide highly-accurate positioning information to indoor people, which efficiently enables microlocation-aware IoT applications and services in smart environments. VIPS can estimate the precise position of an individual and detect the facing direction for each individual. To the best of our knowledge, VIPS is the first indoor positioning system which provides the following features: 1) it achieves the centimeter-grade positioning accuracy for the IoT that can detect the facing direction of individuals, 2) it employs existing surveillance cameras that can keep additional construction cost low, and 3) it establishes an innovative infrastructure for next-generation IoT applications that can make centimeter-accuracy individual-based path planning, group-based emergency evacuation, and microlocation-based geofencing possible. With the IoT, the estimated positions can be transmitted to corresponding individuals for interacting with nearby smart objects. With surveillance cameras, the facing direction of an individual can be detected even if her/his current position is not changed. This paper demonstrates our current prototype.},

abstract={Emerging augmented reality devices allow for visualizing results of numerical simulations ubiquitously. This enables decision makers and engineers in the field to make better decisions. However, computation of resource-intensive simulation models on resource-poor and battery-powered mobile devices requires to drastically reduce the quality of the simulation. We therefore proposed approaches utilizing a remote server and the Reduced Basis Method (RBM) to generate a reduced model of the simulation. In our demo, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches for mobile simulations. Our demo consists of two devices, a mobile device and a server. Both devices are connected via wireless network. The mobile device visualizes the result of a complex computation. Parameters of the simulation are effected by sensors of the mobile device. The user can choose between computing on the mobile device, computing solely on the server, or computing using our approach.},

abstract={Mobile authentication has always been a usability and security challenge. In the past, researchers have discovered various methods to bypass the screen lock protection mechanism without entering authentication credentials on mobile devices. There is a clear need for authentication to be seamless and continuous but also address the security threats that stem from the current unlock-once, always-on mechanisms. To that end, we developed a framework for continuous behavioral authentication of users. In addition, we introduce a configurable “authentication level” for access to resources and applications. For example, if a user's authentication level declines below a pre-specified threshold, all external communications are disabled to prevent exfiltration of sensitive data. Similarly, viewing or modifying any sensitive data on the device is also restricted by moderating access to the underlying file system based on the user's authentication level. We will perform a live demonstration of our entire system implemented for Android 6.0.1, and show how it can successfully defend against a wide range of attacks while improving the usability of the mobile device by offering a seamless authentication experience.},

abstract={Recently, various devices begin to connect the Internet owing to the spread of IoT (Internet of Things). Introduction of IoT technology is progressing also for industrial systems such as plants for the purpose of improving cost efficiency. So, it has become an urgent matter to establish new security countermeasures. But it is not able to respond to some new incidents due to differences in performance or operation between IoT and conventional ICT systems. In some cases, device's stability is more important than the data it self. Therefore, we consider that the security measure from a new viewpoint becomes important. In this paper, we describe the scope of preceding study and hardware security problem that has never been studied. Furthermore, we show the result of load test and impact on output signals under DoS attack. And we propose and implement a new hardware device that can detect DoS attack by only observing electrical signals in the circuit as the countermeasure. Lastly, we explain the contents of the demonstration that implements our proposed method.},

The Tasklet system allows developers to offload self-contained units of computation - the so-called Tasklets - to a pool of heterogeneous computing devices. In this demonstration of the Tasklet system, we uncover the otherwise transparent process of computation offloading and scheduling. Further, we show the easy integration of heterogeneous computing devices and applications for Tasklets. In the demonstration, we focus on three key aspects of the Tasklet system. First, we present the API of the Tasklet middleware and the process of application tailoring with quality of computation. Second, we integrate computation devices during the runtime of Tasklets. A monitoring tool visualizes how Tasklets are scheduled and how resource providers simultaneously enter and leave the system. To show the easy integration of resources, we invite the audience to spontaneously contribute their computational resources to the environment. Third, we show five example applications from different application domains that benefit from using Tasklets.},

abstract={Supporting people in everyday life, be it lifestyle improvement or health care, requires the recognition of their activities. For that purpose, researches typically focus on wearable devices to recognize physical human activities like walking whereas smart environments are commonly the base for the recognition of activities of daily living. However, in many interesting scenarios the recognition of physical activities is often insufficient whereas most smart environment works are restricted to a specific area or one single person. Moreover, the recognition of outdoor activities of daily living gets significantly less attention. In our work, we focus on a real world activity recognition scenario, thus, practical application including environmental impact. In this context, we rely on wearable devices to recognize the physical activities but want to deduce the actual task, i.e., activity of daily living by relying on background and context related information using Markov logic as a probabilistic model. This should enable that the recognition is not restricted to a specific area and that even a smart environment could be more flexible concerning the number of sensors and people. Consequently, a more complete recognition of the daily routine is possible which in turn allows to perform behavior analyses.},

Unprecedented data from everyday devices such as smart wristbands, smart ornaments, smartphones, and ambient sensors provide opportunities for activity mining and inference, but pose fundamental research challenges in data processing, physiological feature extraction, activity learning and inference in the presence of multiple inhabitants. In this thesis, we develop micro-activity driven macro-activity recognition approaches while considering the underpinning spatiotemporal constraints and correlations across multiple inhabitants. We design novel signal processing and machine learning algorithms to detect physiological symptoms and infer macro-level activity of the inhabitants, respectively. We combine these activity recognition methodologies along with the physiological health assessment approaches to quantify the functional, behavioral, and cognitive health of the older adults. real-time data collected data from a continuing care retirement community center (IRB #HP-00064387) helped us to evaluate, compare, and benchmark our proposed computational approaches with the clinical tools used extensively for functional and cognitive health assessment.},

abstract={With the ubiquity of microphone-enabled pervasive device, the use of speaker-microphone to transfer small piece of information has become a hot area in both industry and research communities. Unfortunately, however, microphone-based acoustic communication systems rely on power-consuming digital signal processing (DSP) to decode the modulated information in the sound. Given the battery lifetime of today's mobile devices is limited, microphone-based systems are facing challenges in achieving long-term computing and communication. In this proposal, we aim to investigates the possibility of using a vibration energy harvesting (VEH) device as an receiver for energy-efficient acoustic communication. By modulating the ambient vibration energy using a transmitting speaker, and demodulating the harvested power at the receiving VEH, our current system prototype [1] is able to transmit small amounts of data at reasonable rates between two proximate devices. The key advantage of using VEH as a receiver is that the modulated sound waves can be successfully demodulated directly from the harvested power without employing the power-consuming DSP, which makes a VEH receiver more power efficient than a conventional microphone-based decoder. As part of our future work, we will further improve and optimize the performance of our prototype system while ensure better user experience and system security.},

It is important to note that the occurrences of those anomalies are not intended to provide an automatic subject's cognitive assessment. However, their frequencies and temporal trend can be used to derive behavioral changes. Differently from the other solutions, the occurred abnormal behaviors are inferred at a very fine granularity (e.g., “the subject is eating more cold meals than the usual”, “the subject retrieved a prescribed medicine from the repository but then forgot to take it“, . ..).

The way to establish trust between devices and authenticate these networks depends completely on the scenario. In Body Area Networks human biometrics can serve as a shared secret among devices. In real-time voice communication, the ZRTP protocol allows for interactive trust establishment by recognizing the peer's voice. In asynchronous networks, such as email, other interactive mechanisms have been deployed, such as key fingerprint verification. In our research, we are analyzing the security and usability of existing trust mechanisms for heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, we are proposing protocol changes and new mechanisms to establish trust between devices. In this paper an overview is given over existing and upcoming research in this area.

abstract={While the traditional Visible Light Communication (VLC) system has attracted a lot of research attentions on boosting throughput, using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices, e.g. existing cameras on the smartphones, is a recent trend to implement readily deployable VLC systems. In particular, since LED-Camera VLC systems have shown a promising potential in large indoor communication due to the growing deployment of LED lighting infrastructure, a comprehensive VLC system with cooperative transmission and roaming support has become an impending need. To this end, we propose a novel VLC and visible light sensing (VLS) system to address that by leveraging LED sensing and effective encoding/decoding schemes. It is achieved first by utilizing LED sensing via converting parts of LED luminaire into light sensors to detect diffuse reflection change caused by presence of the user. After the users are detected and located, the system employs rateless codes and newly designed code assignment scheme to collaboratively transmit to detected users in their communication cells. We believe the proposed system has the potential to a roaming support VLC system in the whole building or indoor areas.},

abstract={Annotation of multimodal data sets is often a time consuming and a challenging task as many approaches require an accurate labeling. This includes in particular video recordings as often labeling exact to a frame is required. For that purpose, we created an annotation tool that enables to annotate data sets of video and inertial sensor data. However, in contrast to the most existing approaches, we focus on semi-supervised labeling support to infer labels for the whole dataset. More precisely, after labeling a small set of instances our system is able to provide labeling recommendations and in turn it makes learning of image features more feasible by speeding up the labeling time for single frames. We aim to rely on the inertial sensors of our wristband to support the labeling of video recordings. For that purpose, we apply template matching in context of dynamic time warping to identify time intervals of certain actions. To investigate the feasibility of our approach we focus on a real world scenario, i.e., we gathered a data set which describes an order picking scenario of a logistic company. In this context, we focus on the picking process as the selection of the correct items can be prone to errors. Preliminary results show that we are able to identify 69% of the grabbing motion periods of time.},

We propose a context model where the context is organized according to the different dimensions of the user environment. In addition, we propose the notions of endurants and perdurants as a way to describe how humans aggregate their context depending either on space or time, respectively. To ground our modelling approach in the reality of users, we collaborate with sociology experts in an internal university project aiming at understanding how behavioral patterns of university students in their everyday life affect their academic performance.

abstract={Pervasive computing and, specifically, the Internet of Things aspire to deliver smart services and effortless interactions for their users. Achieving this requires making sense of multiple streams of sensor data, which becomes particularly challenging when these concern people's activities in the real world. In this paper we describe the exploration of different approaches that allow users to self-annotate their activities in near real-time, which in turn can be used as ground-truth to develop algorithms for automated and accurate activity recognition. We offer the lessons we learnt during each design iteration of a smart-phone app and detail how we arrived at our current approach to acquiring ground-truth data `in the wild'. In doing so, we uncovered tensions between researchers' data annotation requirements and users' interaction requirements, which need equal consideration if an acceptable self-annotation solution is to be achieved. We present an ongoing user study of a hybrid approach, which supports activity logging that is appropriate to different individuals and contexts.},

abstract={The annotation of human activity is a crucial prerequisite for applying methods of supervised machine learning. It is typically either obtained by live annotation by the participant or by video log analysis afterwards. Both methods, however, suffer from disadvantages when applied in dementia related nursing homes. On the one hand, people suffering from dementia are not able to produce such annotation and on the other hand, video observation requires high technical effort. The research domain of quality of care addresses these issues by providing observation tools that allow the simultaneous live observation of up to eight participants - dementia care mapping (DCM). We developed an annotation scheme based on the popular clinical observation tool DCM to obtain annotation about challenging behaviours. In this paper, we report our experiences with this approach and discuss the applicability of clinical observation tools in the domain of automatic human activity assessment.},

abstract={Reliably discerning human activity from sensor data is a nontrivial task in ubiquitous computing, which is central to enabling smart environments. Ground-truth acquisition techniques for such environments can be broadly divided into observational and self-reporting approaches. In this paper we explore one self-reporting approach, using speech-enabled logging to generate ground-truth data. We report the results of a user study in which participants (N=12) used both a smart-watch and a smart-phone app to record their activities of daily living using primarily voice, then answered questionnaires comprising the System Usability Scale (SUS) as well as open ended questions about their experiences. Our findings indicate that even though user satisfaction with the voice-enabled activity logging apps was relatively high, this approach presented significant challenges regarding compliance, effectiveness, and privacy. We discuss the implications of these findings with a view to offering new insights and recommendations for designing systems for ground-truth acquisition `in the wild'.},

abstract={The field of Human Action Recognition has expanded greatly in previous years, exploring actions and interactions between individuals via the use of appearance and depth based pose information. There are numerous datasets that display action classes composed of behaviors that are well defined by their key poses, such as `kicking' and `punching'. The CONVERSE dataset presents conversational interaction classes that show little explicit relation to the poses and gestures they exhibit. Such a complex and subtle set of interactions is a novel challenge to the Human Action Recognition community, and one that will push the cutting edge of the field in both machine learning and the understanding of human actions. CONVERSE contains recordings of two person interactions from 7 conversational scenarios, represented as sequences of human skeletal poses captured by the Kinect depth sensor. In this study we discuss a method providing ground truth labelling for the set, and the complexity that comes with defining such annotation. The CONVERSE dataset it made available online.},

abstract={Pervasive and ubiquitous computing increasingly relies on data-driven models learnt from large datasets. This learning process requires annotations in conjunction with datasets to prepare training data. Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) is one application of pervasive and ubiquitous computing that focuses on providing support for individuals. A subset of AAL solutions exist which model and recognize activities/behaviors to provide assistive services. This paper introduces an annotation mechanism for an AAL platform that can recognize, and provide alerts for, generic activities/behaviors. Previous annotation approaches have several limitations that make them unsuited for use in this platform. To address these deficiencies, an annotation solution relying on environmental NFC tags and smartphones has been devised. This paper details this annotation mechanism, its incorporation into the AAL platform and presents an evaluation focused on the efficacy of annotations produced. In this evaluation, the annotation mechanism was shown to offer reliable, low effort, secure and accurate annotations that are appropriate for learning user behaviors from datasets produced by this platform. Some weaknesses of this annotation approach were identified with solutions proposed within future work.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) connects smart objects so they can share information in a network to provide context-sensitive services. The amount of shared information will increase, likely dramatically, as more and more smart objects join the network and disseminate their contextual information. In this paper, we explain how smart IoT devices can share a large amount of context information using much less storage space and communication bandwidth. We use the versatile and simple JSON format at the application interface to allow applications to define their context descriptions, but we convert this JSON format into size-efficient yet equivalent probabilistic data structures for storage or communication. The loss of schema information in the conversion is compensated for by introducing a schema summary, which incorporates a hierarchical structure, and a state machine that recovers the schema information from the relationship among elements in a summary.},

abstract={The use of smartphone and wearable devices in various sporting events is an optimistic opportunity to profile player's physical fitness and physiological health conditioning attributes. Recently a variety of commercial wearables with respect to different sports are available in the market. As these wearables differ for distinctive sports, it becomes a hassle to effectively profile them for multiple sports sessions in day to day practice events. Wrist worn devices like smartwatches are becoming a trend in sports analytics recently and researchers are leveraging them to infer various contexts of the players to improve the quality, tactics, strategy of playing matches against the opponents. Visual observation is the most popular way to track a player's abilities in soccer, but as a player it is not always possible to self-assess your own strengths and weaknesses in a field. In this paper, we propose to exploit the wrist worn devices with built in accelerometer to help represent attributes of technical judgement, tactical awareness and physical aspects of a soccer player. We propose to use deep learning to build our classification model which analyzes different soccer events like in-possession, pass, kick, sprint, run and dribbling. Based on these soccer events, we evaluate the overall ability of a soccer player. Our experiments show that, these wearable technology guided attributes profiling can help a coach or scout to better understand the competence of a player in addition to traditional visual observation.},

pages={170-175}, 
abstract={Modern smartphone applications rely on contextual information while providing the users with relevant and timely content and services. One way of generating such contextual information is by employing learning systems to model user behavior. Motion-based sensors, such as the accelerometer or gyroscope, have been previously employed for recognizing predefined high-level physical activities such as climbing stairs, jogging, or driving. In practice, human activities are highly diverse and unsupervised methods must be used to expose complex behavioral characteristics that are user-centric. This paper proposes a novel machine learning model for user authentication and trust that is continuously assessing the user activities in an effort to expose deviations from known training data. The goal is to export this trust score as a contextual input to mobile apps for detection of unauthorized access, fraudulent transactions, the progress of a disease, or other behavioral changes such as stage fright, intoxicated behavior, or mood changes. All collected data and generated models of the user remains on the smartphone, and only the score needs to be revealed to the apps. As a result, the user controls the data without the need to share with any remote entity. The paper presents preliminary performance results of this technique.},

abstract={There is a growing need for Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), in which vehicles communicate with each other (i. e., Vehicle to Vehicle, V2V) or with the infrastructure (i. e., Vehicle to Infrastructure, V2I) on a wireless basis. This paper presents an improved traffic monitoring system for VANET applications via a proposed security scheme. Specifically, the proposed model analyzes the monitored scene, and automatically generates monitoring reports, which contain the current time, current location, and traffic event type (which may be an accident, crowd, demonstration or protest events). Additionally, two schemes have been proposed: one is detecting vehicle accident using image processing techniques, and the other is detecting both transmitted fake reports about the road and the malicious car's driver, who transmits those fake reports. The security scheme achieves source authentication, data confidentiality, driver anonymity, and non-repudiation security services. Also the monitoring system achieves 85.41% average accuracy and 84.093 msec. average execution time with only 0.011% increase in computation overhead for applying the security scheme.},

The proposed framework brain tumor detection is an important tool to detect the tumor and differentiate between patients that diagnosis as certain brain tumor and probable brain tumor due to its ability to measure regional changes features in the brain that reflect disease progression. The framework consists of four steps: segmentation, feature extraction and feature reduction, classification, finally the parameter values of the classifier are dynamically optimized using the optimization algorithm Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO) which is a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) optimizers to maximize the classification accuracy. We used 80, 100, 150 neuroimages training data set sizes to train the system and 100 out of sample neuroimages to test the system. The proposed system preliminary results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the system to accurately detect and classify the brain tumor in MRI, that motivate us to expand applying of this system on other types of tumors in medical imagery.},

year={2017},

pages={188-193}, 
abstract={Our ability to synthesize sensory data that preserves specific statistical properties of the real data has had tremendous implications on data privacy and big data analytics. The synthetic data can be used as a substitute for selective real data segments - that are sensitive to the user - thus protecting privacy and resulting in improved analytics. However, increasingly adversarial roles taken by data recipients such as mobile apps, or other cloud-based analytics services, mandate that the synthetic data, in addition to preserving statistical properties, should also be “difficult” to distinguish from the real data. Typically, visual inspection has been used as a test to distinguish between datasets. But more recently, sophisticated classifier models (discriminators), corresponding to a set of events, have also been employed to distinguish between synthesized and real data. The model operates on both datasets and the respective event outputs are compared for consistency. Prior work on data synthesis have often focussed on classifiers that are built for features explicitly preserved by the synthetic data. This suggests that an adversary can build classifiers that can exploit a potentially disjoint set of features for differentiating between the two datasets. In this paper, we take a step towards generating sensory data that can pass a deep learning based discriminator model test, and make two specific contributions: first, we present a deep learning based architecture for synthesizing sensory data. This architecture comprises of a generator model, which is a stack of multiple Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) networks and a Mixture Density Network (MDN); second, we use another LSTM network based discriminator model for distinguishing between the true and the synthesized data. Using a dataset of accelerometer traces, collected using smartphones of users doing their daily activities, we show that the deep learning based dis- riminator model can only distinguish between the real and synthesized traces with an accuracy in the neighborhood of 50%.},

abstract={Summary form only given. The paradigm of crowd-assisted sensing primarily relies on volunteers, who use their personal devices to collect sensor information. To foster participants' contributions and hence ensure the viability of the underlying applications, different approaches, such as novel incentive schemes and privacy-preserving mechanisms, have been proposed. In most cases, these approaches have been evaluated by means of simulations and proof-of-concept implementations. While these evaluations are necessary to measure the efficacy and performance of the introduced solutions, they often neglect the human factors, despite their central role in crowd assisted applications. In my keynote, I will therefore emphasize on these aspects by presenting different studies, which my research team and I have conducted in the last years. Covered challenges range from the exploration of attitudes to participatory sensing tasks in location-based gaming communities to the participants' expectation in terms of rewards based on the invested resources. Our studies share common goals including analyzing the requirements from the perspective of potential users, which may contribute to their acceptance of novel solutions as well as motivate them to engage in crowd-assisted sensing applications in both short- and long-term.},

Previous efforts in location-based systems have mostly paid attention to achieve high accuracy in localization or navigation, with the assumption that the mapping between the locations and the semantic labels are given or will be done manually. In this paper, we propose a system called Deep-Crowd-Label that automatically assigns semantic labels to locations. We propose a novel transfer learning method that leverages deep learning models deployed on many crowd-workers to assign semantic labels to locations by classifying associated visual data. Deep-Crowd-Label uses the power of the crowd to aggregate the individual predictions done by the model across the crowd-workers visiting the same location. Our preliminary experiments with 26 different types of locations show that, our method and our prototype system is able to find the right label for the locations i.e., coffee shop to the Starbucks.},

As a proof of concept, this paper proposes and evaluates a promising approach for building the radio map based on a crowdsourced dataset. Evaluation shows that we can achieve a mean positioning error of less than 3 meters base on the crowdsourced map, slightly worse than conventional path survey approach.},

abstract={Mobile phones are equipped with a rich set of sensors which are useful in deploying various sensing activities. We focus on participatory sensing in which every participant carrying smartphone senses its environment and shares it with server. Most of the applications require location information to perform sensing activity. But, GPS drains considerable amount of energy if used for localization. So, a set of devices are chosen as broadcasters which turn on GPS, and the neighbouring devices rely on them to calculate their position. We propose an efficient energy model to minimize the power consumption of such a system. The existing scheme for finding optimal set of broadcasters is based on greedy algorithm. This is time efficient only when the number of participants are small. We propose a sorting based algorithm. This provides better time complexity for moderate and large data sets which is the actual case in real scenarios. We validate our work with extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets. Results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively minimizes energy and saves 12-25% of the time for medium and large data sets.},

abstract={Mobile crowd-sourcing can become as a strategy to perform time-sensitive urban tasks (such as municipal monitoring and last mile logistics) by effectively coordinating smartphone users. The success of the mobile crowd-sourcing platform depends mainly on its effectiveness in engaging crowd-workers, and recent studies have shown that compared to the pull-based approach, which relies on crowd-workers to browse and commit to tasks they would want to perform, the push-based approach can take into consideration of worker's daily routine, and generate highly effective recommendations. As a result, workers waste less time on detours, plan more in advance, and require much less planning effort. However, the push-based systems are not without drawbacks. The major concern is the potential privacy invasion that could result from the disclosure of individual's mobility traces to the crowd-sourcing platform. In this paper, we first demonstrate specific threats of continuous sharing of users locations in such push-based crowd-sourcing platforms. We then propose a simple yet effective location perturbation technique that obfuscates certain user locations to achieve privacy guarantees while not affecting the quality of the recommendations the system generates.We use the mobility traces data we obtained from our urban campus to show the trade-offs between privacy guarantees and the quality of the recommendations associated with the proposed solution. We show that obfuscating even 75% of the individual trajectories will affect the user to make another extra 1.8 minutes of detour while gaining 62.5% more uncertainty of his location traces.},

abstract={Preserving user privacy is crucial for the wide adoption of crowdsensing and participatory sensing applications that rely on personal devices. Currently, each application comes with its own hardwired and possibly undocumented privacy support (if any), while the horizontal protection mechanisms provided by operating and runtime systems operate at a low level that can significantly harm application utility, or even render an application useless. To achieve greater flexibility, we propose a framework that decouples the privacy mechanism from the application logic so that it can be developed by another, perhaps more trusted party, and which allows the dynamic binding of different privacy mechanisms to the same application running on the user's mobile device. We describe a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed framework for Android, where privacy mechanisms are independently developed as separate plug-in components. Based on a simple but powerful API, it is possible to implement a wide range of standard privacy approaches, including collaborative schemes that involve data exchanges among multiple personal devices.},

abstract={The ability to detect gunshots can provide someone with invaluable information in various circumstances. For the military and public servants, detecting gunshots can help save lives and potentially target offenders. People participating in shooting sports as beginners or professionals can also benefit from the use of sensors for improving their reaction and self control during training. Most current methods for gunshot detection require expensive devices that are purpose built or developed and often only examine one or two features of the gunshots such as the sound, recoil, or visible flash. Using the current sensors built into smartphones, 15 samples utilizing 10 different sensors are used examine how gunshot detection can be performed through the use of simple sensors. This extension of human activity recognition resulted in gunshot classification accuracy ranging from 0.0% - 99.7% with an average of 86.6%. Understanding how simple sensors respond to gunshots can provide simple and easy accessibility to new detection methods and ample opportunities to improve this potential field for various personal and smart city applications such as crime detection, policing, gunshot violence monitoring and control in the community.},

abstract={Smart Homes aim to improve the daily lives of the inhabitants by integrating a variety of context-aware applications, generally pertaining to multiple fields and provided by different actors. These applications share the same context and may have to compete for the access to resources in their surroundings. Sharing resources leads to conflicts, particularly if these applications act in contradictory ways or have interfering effects on the environment. Such conflicts can lead to critical situations by putting the home's inhabitants at risk. In this paper, we present a context-based approach to manage conflicts among pervasive applications in smart home environments.

However, pervasive applications raise major challenges in term of software engineering and remain hard to develop, deploy, execute, and maintain. In particular, smart home platforms must be autonomic because their management cannot be done by end users who do not possess the necessary skills.

The task is loosely structured with minimal outside assistance to better reflect the ad-hoc nature of many real world construction scenarios. Audio data, recorded from chest-worn microphones, is used to reveal information on collocation, i.e. whether or not participants are near one another. Movement data, recorded using 3-axis accelerometers worn on each person's head and wrists, is used to provide information on correlated movements, such as when participants help one another to lift a heavy object. Collocation and correlated movement information is then combined to determine who is working together at any given time. The work shows how data from commonly available sensors can be combined across multiple people using a simple, low power algorithm to detect a range of physical collaborations.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of recognizing activities and dynamic ad-hoc collaboration involving multiple users. Thus, we consider people performing various predominantly physical, compound activities in a smart environment (which includes personal/wearable devices). In this case, being “compound” means that the activity can be decomposed into primitive (atomic) actions that are executed by individual users. We investigate how noisy recognition of the atomic actions of individual users can be used to identify instances of cooperation at the level of the compound activities. To this end, we first introduce a hierarchical tree plan library model for activity representation. Using this new model we developed an algorithm, which allows detecting of ad-hoc team interaction without any further knowledge about roles or preliminary designed tasks. We evaluate the model and algorithm “post-mortem” with data extracted from video footage of a real nurse-emergency-training session and with increasing difficulties by artificially adding recognition-errors.},

To the end, it utilizes a correlation based feature selection method to identify information that is relevant for machine learning modelling. The effect of spatio-temporal features selection on prediction output and the effect of training data quantity on convergence characteristics were analysed and discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using a 20-household, half-year data set from an ongoing research testbed set up at the faculty housing units of Singapore University of Technology and Design. An linear combination method was proposed to combine models and the resulting model gave a mean absolute percentage error of 11.27%.},

pages={297-301}, 
abstract={Due to the highly predictable daily movements of citizens in urban areas, mobile traffic shows repetitive patterns with spatio-temporal variations. This phenomenon is known as Tidal Effect analogy to the rise and fall of the sea levels. Recognizing and defining traffic load patterns at the base station thus plays a vital role in traffic engineering, network design and load balancing since it represents an important solution for the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that face network congestion problems or over-provisioning of the link capacity. Previous works have dealt with the classification and identification of patterns through the use of techniques, which inspect the flow of data of a particular application. But they assume prior knowledge on the stream of data packets, making the trend identification much inefficient. Recent methods based on machine learning techniques build their classification models based on sample data collected at certain points of the network with high accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem by applying matrix factorization based models on real-world datasets, identifying typical patterns from data streams, which frequently occur in the network, without investigating the type of flows. For that, we propose a Collective Non-negative Matrix Factorization based model combining multi-source data, such as point of interests attributes, traffic data and base station information, identifying the basic patterns of those areas of the city that present the same type of attributes. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with the baselines.},

abstract={Crowdsensing is for a few years a new way to gather information. Most smartphones and mobile operating systems provide applications which are able to sense and gather several data from the environment of the device. Thanks to this collected data, it is possible to combine information from several probes. A very common use case is the collection of network scans with location to help the localisation feature of these devices. Nevertheless, most users are not aware of this spying. The collected data might represent infringements of privacy. One possible solution to keep gathering these data while maintaining privacy would consist in device-to-device communications in order to break the links between data and users. In this article we propose an approach to test the feasibility of such a system. We collected data from mobile users to combine location and network scans data. With this data, we test the accuracy level we can reach while using Wi-Fi localisation. We analyse how a new measure should be pushed and how many scans should be realised to provide location-based Wi-Fi. We analyse the minimal dataset to cover the set of locations covered by users and prove that a multi-user gathering system can benefit the users.},

pages={326-326}, 
abstract={Summary form only given. Companies in China, Japan and USA started introducing social robots at the customer interface in various industries, such as hospitality services, retailing, and health care services. In contrast to production robots, social robots are humanoid and communicate with speech and gestures with the primary purpose to interact with humans. While the prevalence of social robots is increasing, knowledge about the user acceptance of these robots is scarce. Based on an experimental series, potential stressors as well as emotional and behavioral user responses to the interaction with a social robot are examined. The experimental setting was a hotel reception, in which participants had to interact with the social robot (i.e., the humanoid robot Pepper) in the role of a hotel guest. Participants' psychological responses to the social robot were assessed via self-assessments of the participants. Beyond these standard measures, external raters evaluated the participants' responses by evaluating their facial expressions and gestures on the basis of the video recordings of the experimental procedure. Furthermore, a non-intrusive wearable device, Empatica E4, was used to measure physiological data, in particular heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA). Results show that participants were able to clearly recognize robotic emotions and behaviors. Furthermore, we could reveal similar patterns within a human-robot-interaction as compared to human-human-interactions.},

abstract={The experience of negative emotions in everyday life, such as anger and anxiety, can have adverse effects on long-term cardiovascular health. However, objective measurements provided by mobile technology can promote insight into this psychobiological process and promote self-awareness and adaptive coping. It is postulated that the creation of a mobile lifelogging platform can support this approach by continuously recording personal data via mobile/wearable devices and processing this information to measure physiological correlates of negative emotions. This paper describes the development of a mobile lifelogging system that measures anxiety and anger during real-life driving. A number of data streams have been incorporated in the platform, including cardiovascular data, speed of the vehicle and first-person photographs of the environment. In addition, thirteen participants completed five days of data collection during daily commuter journeys to test the system. The design of the system hardware and associated data streams are described in the current paper, along with the results of preliminary data analysis.},

abstract={The advent of state-of-the-art telecommunication devices like smartphones has led to a considerable increase in the amount of electronic communication exchanged. While the improved availability increases personal flexibility-reducing rigidity in time and place of communication-it comes at a price. The `anytime, anyplace'-accessibility, which has become the norm in today's (working) society, can cause adverse effects to an individual's mood and emotions, and especially raise the stress level. Consequently, in this paper, we discuss methods for measuring stress via mobile devices, analyzing their pros and cons. Subsequently, we analyze which situational information-comprising the prevailing context of the users and their usage of communication devices-is useful for the quantification of the psychological stress perceived by users. Based on a field study with 27 participants, we observe that, while longer working hours and higher number of appointments have a positive correlation with an increased stress level, there is no one-fits-all method for stress measurement. In turn, we take the first steps towards non-intrusive methods to identify stressful situations and thus, lay the foundation for future research on stress mitigation.},

Results of a qualitative study with 63 participants reveal that users form their expectations toward FSR based on three categories: (1) their ideal imagination of a service, (2) their expectations toward a human frontline employee, and (3) their expectations toward a self-service technology. The theoretically developed Robot- Acceptance-Model (RAM) is tested in an experimental services setting with 82 users and service frontline robots.},

abstract={The recognition of human emotions using physiological signals such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Electrocardiogram (ECG) or Electromyography (EMG), has been extensively researched in the past attracting a lot of interest during the last few decades. Although showing a relatively satisfactory performance under lab conditions, Emotion Recognition (ER) systems using physiological signals are not widely used in real-world scenarios. One important fact is that, in the real world, physiological signals may be influenced by human movement and therefore, they cannot be used as a unique indicative of emotions. In this paper, we investigate the influence of human movement on ER using physiological signals. We compare different measures of emotion before and after a test person has performed some physical activity (e.g. walking, going upstairs). We discuss the main differences between recognizing emotions in the lab and the real world and provide new insights into the development of ER systems in real-world scenarios.},

As a first step of our research, we developed a machine learning model to estimate the emotions conveyed in a music clip and achieved 88% classification accuracy with cross-validation technique. The second part of our work involved developing a web application using Microsoft Emotion API to determine the emotions in photos, so the system can find the best candidate music for each photo in the slideshow. 16 users rated the recommended background music for a set of photos using a 5-point likert scale and we achieved an average rate of 4.1, 3.6 and 3.0 for the photo sets 1, 2, and 3 respectively of our evaluation task.},

abstract={Investigating users' interruptibility as an indicator of his/her attention status has been essential in recent pervasive computing where the users' attention resources get scarce against ever increasing amounts of information. In this paper, we address research problems related to the users' available interruptibility, their physical activities, and their current locations and situations. We propose the “Interruptibility Map”, a geographical tool for analyzing and visualizing the user's local interruptibility status in the context of smart city research. Our map describes where citizens are expected to feel more or less interruptive against notifications produced by computing devices, which are known to have negative effects on work productivity, emotion, and psychological state. We conducted a continuous analysis from our previous research and a new additional in-the-wild user study for 2 weeks with 29 participants to investigate the relationship between one's interruptibility and their locations and situations. As a highlight of our findings, we found certain pairs of user activity change and a location that showed better interruptibility to users, such as an activity change of “when user's riding car(bus) stops” in the bus commute situation.},

pages={363-368}, 
abstract={Applying Software Defined Network (SDN) technology to wireless network attracts much attention. Our previous study proposed several channel utilization methods based on SDN/OpenFlow-enabled multi-channel wireless mesh network (WMN). However, since control messages are transmitted with data traffic on a same channel in WMN, it inevitably affects the network capacity. Especially, the amount of control messages for collecting statistical information of each flow (FlowStats) linearly increases in accordance with the number of flows, thereby being the dominant overhead. In this paper, we propose a method that prevents the increase of control traffic while maintaining network performance. Specifically, our proposed method uses statistical information of each interface (PortStats) instead of FlowStats, and handles multiple flows on the interface together. To handle a part of flows, we propose a way to estimate statistical information of individual flow without extra control messages. Finally, we show that the proposed method can maintain good network capacity with less packet losses and less control messages.},

abstract={Recently, the vehicular sensor network (VSN) is emerging as an efficient solution for executing different sensing tasks in urban environments. However, due to the heterogeneity of vehicles in sensing capability and uncontrollable movement trajectory, it is a challenge to best provide the required quality of information (QoI) of the sensing task in VSNs. In this paper, we introduce a VSN architecture, in which multiple vehicles cooperatively sense a particular urban area of interest, and process the sensed data to achieve the QoI requirements while considering incentives for environment sensing, data processing and communication. Furthermore, we formulate and solve an optimization problem for determining the optimal sampling rates for vehicles with the objective of minimizing the total incentive under the constraints related to QoI requirements. Various numerical results based on realistic vehicular traces are presented to justify the effectiveness of proposed approach in the vehicles' QoI-aware cooperative sensing operations.},

pages={375-380}, 
abstract={A significant vulnerability in social sensing based services is false notifications from sensing agents, thereby resulting in inaccurate published information that induces loss of revenue and business goodwill. Existing popular schemes utilize rating feedbacks (over the published information) to quantify the perceived usefulness (quality) of the information. However, these schemes do not reward the confidence of the feedback community and lacks provision to regulate the impact of uncertain feedbacks (ratings), and hence can be easily manipulated. In this paper, we propose a model, called W2Q, to mathematically evaluate the Quality of Information (QoI) as a function of the proportion of positive ratings, total number of ratings, and amortized proportion of uncertain ratings. The proposed model exploits Bayesian inference, and a dual weighted regression model to compute the QoI of any published information. We evaluate the proposed model through an experimental study assuming a crowd sourced-urban application as a proof of concept. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art Jøsang's belief model, the resultant QoI score is less susceptible to rogue ratings and captures subtle differences between true and false information.},

Existing gaze based typing systems encounter problems of unintentional key presses, extensive calibration process and inbuilt noise of eye trackers. We tried to solve these problems in the EyeAssist system by employing accurate gaze tracking. Fixation information are derived from the acquired gaze data. The systematic and variable noises of the eye tracker are being removed by graph signal processing based filters, Kalman filter and linear transformation. A unique one-time calibration which is subject and session independent has made the system easy to use without compromising its efficacy. The system has provision for setting variable dwell time according to users' preferences. EyeAssist also provides some unique features like text to speech conversion of typed sentences, predictive word and sentence entry etc. Results show that the average typing rate is 11.8 words per minute with an average error rate of 6.6%. Moreover the error rate reduces drastically with some practice. The system is user friendly, easy to use which makes it a perfect choice for patients suffering with neuro-motor disabilities.},

Many research groups are studying pervasive solutions to continuously and unobtrusively monitor fragile subjects at their homes, reducing health-care costs and supporting medical diagnosis. Among the several behavioral aspects which clinicians are interested in monitoring, anomalous behaviors while performing activities of daily living are of great importance. In this work, we aim at improving the state of the art on this topic by enabling the recognition of fine-grained anomalies by detecting specific object manipulations. We attach tiny Bluetooth Low Energy accelerometers to several household objects in order to detect which manipulations are performed by the inhabitant on which object. Detected manipulations, combined with data from other environmental sensors deployed in the home, are used to infer ADLs and fine-grained abnormal behaviors. Preliminary results on a dataset with hundreds of complex activities captured in a smarthome environment show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Passively detecting and counting the number of swallows in food intake enables accurate detection of eating episodes in free-living participants, and aids in characterizing eating episodes. On average, the more food consumed, the greater the number of swallows; and swallows have been shown to positively correlate with caloric intake. While passive sensing measures have shown promise in recent years, they are yet to be used reliably to detect eating, impeding the development of timely intervention delivery that change poor eating behavior. This paper presents a novel integrated wearable necklace that comprises two piezoelectric sensors vertically positioned around the neck, an inertial motion unit, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to detect and count swallows. A unique correlation of derivative features creates candidate swallows. To reduce the FPR features are extracted using symmetric and asymmetric windows surrounding each candidate swallow to feed into a Random Forest classifier. Independently, a LSTM network is trained from raw data using automated feature learning methods. In an in-lab study comprising confounding activities of 10 participants, results show a 3.34 RMSE of swallow count using LSTM, and a 76.07% average F-measure of swallows, outperforming the Random Forest classifier. This system thus shows promise in accurately detecting and characterizing eating patterns, enabling passive detection of swallow count, and paving the way for timely interventions to prevent problematic eating.},

abstract={Energy balance is one component of weight management, but passive objective measures of caloric intake are non-existent. Given the recent success of actigraphy as a passive objective measure of the physical activity construct that relieves participants of the burden of biased self-report, computer scientists and engineers are aiming to find a passive objective measure of caloric intake. Passive sensing food intake systems have failed to go beyond the lab and into behavioral research in part due to low adherence to wearing passive monitoring systems. While system accuracy and battery lifetime are sine qua non to a successfully deployed technology, they come second to adherence, since a system does nothing if it remains unused. This paper focuses on adherence as affected by: 1) perceived data privacy; 2) stigma of wearing devices; 3) comfort. These factors highlight new challenges surrounding participant informed consent and Institutional Review Board (IRB) risk assessment. The wearables examined include neck- and wrist-worn sensors, and video camera-based systems.

pages={419-424}, 
abstract={Poor sitting postures influence one's health and can cause upper limb and neck disorder. Current solutions for siting posture recognition, however, are impractical due to intrusiveness, high cost or low generalization capability. Particularly, most of the existing solutions are chair-dependent, which are highly coupled with certain types of chairs. In this paper, we design Postureware, a smart cushion, which is a low-cost, non-intrusive and general sitting posture recognition system. In particular, Postureware incorporates very thin pressure sensors to offer non-intrusive experience, an effective sensor placement solution to reduce cost, a set of user-invariant features and an ensemble learning classifier to improve generalization ability. We implement a prototype system and conduct extensive experiments. The results show that Postureware can classify fifteen fine-grained postures with high accuracy.},

abstract={Restoration of functional independence in gait and vehicle transfer ability is a common goal of inpatient rehabilitation. Currently, ambulation changes tend to be subjectively assessed by clinicians. To investigate more precise objective assessment of progress in inpatient rehabilitation, we quantitatively assessed gait and transfer performances over the course of rehabilitation with wearable inertial sensors for 20 patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation services. Participant performance was recorded on a sequence of ambulatory tasks that closely resemble everyday activities. We developed a custom software system to process sensor signals and compute metrics that characterize ambulation performance. We quantified changes in gait and transfer ability by performing a repeated measures comparison of the metrics one week apart. Metrics showing the greatest improvement are walking speed, stride regularity, acceleration root mean square, walking smoothness, shank peak angular velocity, and shank range of motion. Wearable sensor-derived metrics can potentially provide rehabilitation therapists with additional valuable information to aid in treatment decisions.},

abstract={Physical activity helps reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and obesity. The ability to monitor a person's daily activity level can inform self-management of physical activity and related interventions. For older adults with obesity, the importance of regular, physical activity is critical to reduce the risk of long-term disability. In this work, we present ActivityAware, an application on the Amulet wrist-worn device that measures daily activity levels (sedentary, moderate and vigorous) of individuals, continuously and in real-time. The app implements an activity-level detection model, continuously collects acceleration data on the Amulet, classifies the current activity level, updates the day's accumulated time spent at that activity level, logs the data for later analysis, and displays the results on the screen. We developed an activity-level detection model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We trained our classifiers using data from a user study, where subjects performed the following physical activities: sit, stand, lay down, walk and run. With 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross validation, we obtained preliminary results that suggest accuracies up to 98%, for n=14 subjects. Testing the ActivityAware app revealed a projected battery life of up to 4 weeks before needing to recharge. The results are promising, indicating that the app may be used for activity-level monitoring, and eventually for the development of interventions that could improve the health of individuals.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Recent popularity in smart devices, for example smartphones, has created an increased interest in carrying small devices with limited battery capacity. Unfortunately, smartphones are notorious for consuming energy far too quickly. Although certain advances have been made on the hardware side such as better batteries, this talk is focused on improving energy management software in the lower layer system to make better use of existing batteries. For modern smartphone, a major cause of battery drain is wireless communications. Most smartphones come equipped with multiple radio transceivers, such as Bluetooth, GPS, WiFi and 4G, among which power hungry WiFi or 4G radios are required for access to the Internet. The frequency of use of these radios is spurred by the popularity of smartphone applications, and many applications require the phone to be constantly connected to the Internet. The wide availability of applications, for instance the Android Market has over 700K registered applications, shows that the need to save smartphone radio energy is highly relevant and urgent today.},

abstract={Recently, IoT (Internet of Things) technologies have been attracting increasing attention. Among many applications of IoT, homes can be the most promising target. One of the purposes to deploy IoT in homes is automatic recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs). It is expected that ADL recognition in homes enables many new services such as elderly people monitoring and low energy appliance control. In existing studies on ADL recognition, however, it is hard to build a system to acquire data for ADL recognition in terms of installation cost. In this paper, we propose a method that reduces costs of the ADL recognition system by using ECHONET Lite-ready appliances which are expected to be widely spread in the future. ECHONET Lite is a communication protocol for control and sensor networks in smart-homes and standardized as ISO/IEC-4-3. The proposed method utilizes information (e.g., on/off state) from appliances and motion sensors attached to them as features and recognizes ADLs through machine learning. To evaluate the proposed method, we collected data in our smart-home testbed while several participants are living there. As a result, the proposed method achieved about 68% classification accuracy for 9 different activities.},

abstract={We devise an inexpensive and intuitive system for bus route navigation for locales where public transportation may serve as a prevalent mode of commute but where technologies that make arrival predictions through tracking vehicles in transit through GPS or other means do not exist. These systems typically require real-time monitoring of traffic variations. We provide a personalized approach where in a world of pervasive smart phone use, users may take advantage of sensor data to learn and personalize their bus routes, and alert them on time when a bus stop is approaching. We accomplish this through the development and implementation of two algorithms: 1) turn detection using on-board compass sensor of a smart phone, and 2) characterizing road segments in terms of turns and thereby predicting approaching bus stops. We conduct field experiments on a route with four selected bus stops in the town of Chapel Hill. Results show that the accuracy of turn detection and detection of approaching bus stops are 95.7% and 83%, respectively.},

The objective of this study is to present a multisensory system that investigates walking patterns to predict a cautious gait in stroke patient. For this study, a smartphone built-in sensor and an IoT-shoe with a Wi-Fi communication module is used to discreetly monitor insole pressure and accelerations of the patient's motion.

We apply this hierarchy to represent the electricity delivery structure from the utilities to individual residences. Our system captures additional data generated by various devices as user context and uses this context to determine user flexibility towards energy management.

abstract={Delay tolerant networks (DTN) are characterized by lack of end-to-end communications and stable infrastructures. This paper deals with DTN networks consisting of a number of heterogeneous mobile fishing vessels where some nodes, referred to as adaptive nodes, are capable of communicating through long-range Wi-Fi whereas other nodes are having simple Wi-Fi access network. The nodes form different clusters consisting of adaptive nodes and access nodes. Message routing in this heterogeneous network happens through adaptive nodes if the source and destination nodes belong to different clusters. Real data from field study reflects that mobile nodes in this network follow Gaussian-Markov mobility model and may have high inter-meeting arrival time based on deployment and node density. Our proposed DTN routing protocol incorporates simple encounter-based message forwarding and achieves lower latency and high delivery probability in the range of 90-98% for most of the scenarios. The proposed protocol is verified through a realistic mobile ad-hoc wireless simulator.},

Essential for the IoT to function is a reliable Internet connection. In 2016 the International Telecommunication Union reports 3.9 billion people - 53% of the world's population are not using the Internet [1]. Projects like Loon (X) and Aquila (Facebook) aim to solve this connectivity gap using atmospheric satellites to deliver 4G-like signals to underserved regions. With the recent interest in low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the license-free ISM bands, we consider using atmospheric satellites to improve coverage in LPWAN networks. We find that LPWAN technologies are compatible with atmospheric satellites and demonstrate that significant connectivity gains are possible by locating an LPWAN base station at altitude from 1 km - 28 km when compared to a typical ground-based base station.},

abstract={IoT (Internet of Things) has attracted a lot of attention recently. IoT devices need to report their data or status to base stations at various frequencies. The IoT communications observed by a base station normally exhibit the following characteristics: (1) massively connected, (2) lightly loaded per packet, and (3) periodical or at least mostly predictable. The current design principals of communication networks, when applied to IoT scenarios, however, do not fit well to these requirements. For example, an IPv6 address is 128 bits, which is much longer than a 16-bit temperature report. Also, contending to send a small packet is not cost-effective. In this work, we propose a novel framework, which is slot-based, schedule-oriented, and identity-free for uploading IoT devices' data. We show that it fits very well for IoT applications. We propose two schemes, from an ideal one to a more practical one. The main idea is to bundle time slots with certain hashing functions of device IDs, thus significantly reducing transmission overheads, including device IDs and contention overheads.},

However, several problems still remain open regarding cloud deployment and provisioning. In this paper, we address the problem of provisioning offloading as a service in large-scale IoT deployments. We design and develop an AutoScaler, an essential component for our offloading architecture to handle offloading workload. In addition, we also develop an offloading simulator to generate dynamic offloading workload of multiple devices. With this toolkit, we study the effect of task acceleration in different cloud servers and analyze the capacity of several cloud servers to handle multiple concurrent requests. We conduct multiple experiments in a real testbed to evaluate the system and present our experiences and lessons learned. From the results, we find that the AutoScaler component introduces a very small overhead of ≈150 milliseconds in the total response time of a request, which is a fair price to pay to empower the offloading architectures with multi-tenancy ability and dynamic horizontal scaling for IoT scenarios.},

abstract={The rapid increase of modern wireless technology opens the door for several new applications using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In an educational environment, students depend on the transit bus system for their daily routine and there is a high demand of people to be served by buses around university campuses in the United States of America. Often times, the members of university communities find themselves waiting for a significant amount of time for a bus to arrive at the bus station. Universities have numerous bus stops as well as routes on which riders can use for travel. Several of these bus stops are covered by WiFi capabilities, and usually students are checking their smart phones while waiting for bus arrival. In order to monitor the quality of transit buses and passengers' services, we design, develop, and demonstrate a low cost IoT system that detects the majority of the riders on the bus system at each station. In this paper, the IoT devices collect, analyze and archive transit and passenger data (e.g., waiting times) to Cloud Storage from each bus station. The goal is to improve the passenger's experience by refining the current infrastructure in place, focusing on better planning and increasing bus ridership through better scheduling. By collecting such data (e.g., waiting times), the performance of the bus system can be further analyzed and suggest changes to a route in order to achieve a more efficient and sustainable urban transportation system.},

abstract={Emerging ride-on-demand services (e.g., Uber or Uber-like) are vying to penetrate into the market of traditional taxi service, and they are ubiquitous in the nature, by using smart mobile devices like on-car GPS and mobile phone. These ubiquitous services are also beneficial for the environment by increasing the utilization of cars and improving travel efficiency. Through collaboration with a leading service provider in China, we are able to collect vast amount of accurate data and analyze the nature of the demand and dynamic pricing mechanisms that match the supply with demand. We consider the analysis as an important step towards making the ubiquitous service more efficient and beneficial to the sustainability of future smart cities. We collect datasets of passengers' orders and payment information, and focus on the analysis of demand and dynamic pricing. In demand analysis, we discuss its general characteristics, passenger grouping and demand clustering; in dynamic pricing analysis, we discuss the pattern and determination of dynamic pricing multipliers. Our findings pave the way for future study on system optimization, dynamic pricing and policy considerations.},

pages={515-520}, 
abstract={Pervasive technologies permeating our immediate surroundings provide a wide variety of low-cost means of sensing and actuating in our environment. This paper presents an approach for leveraging insights onto the lifestyle and routines of the users in order to control heating in a smart home through the use of individual climate zones, while ensuring system efficiency at a grid-level scale. Organizing smart living spaces into controllable individual climate zones allows us to exert a more fine-grained level of control. Thus, the system can benefit from a higher degree of freedom to adjust the heat demand according to the system objectives. Whereas district heating planing is only concerned with balancing heat demand among buildings, we extend the reach of these systems inside the home through the use of pervasive sensing and actuation. That is to say, we bridge the gap between traditional district heating systems and pervasive technologies in the home designed to maintain the thermal comfort of the user, in order to increase efficiency. The objective is to automate heating based on the user's preferences and behavioral patterns. The control scheme proposed applies a learning algorithm to take advantage of the sensing data inside the home in combination with an optimization procedure designed to trade-off the discomfort undertaken by the user and heating supply costs. We report on preliminary simulation results showing the effectiveness of our approach and describe the setup of our forthcoming field study.},

abstract={Refrigerators are commonly used by multiple users in the home and office. However, expired food is sometimes left in the refrigerator, and users may eat food belonging to others since food is often arranged in the refrigerator in a disorderly manner. This happens because food is not organized by owner. If food can be linked with its owner, users will not eat food belonging to others, and food in the refrigerator will be consumed prior to expiration by informing the owner of the expiration date. The simplest way to link food with its owner is to input the name of the owner manually every time he or she puts food in the refrigerator, which, however, is tedious and impractical. We propose a method that identifies who put food in the refrigerator by using pressure sensors, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope attached to the refrigerator door. The method analyzes the motions of opening/closing a refrigerator door and the pressure distribution of gripping the door-handle. In the future, we aim to link food with its owner. From the experiment, we confirmed that the method achieves 90.3% accuracy in user identification for a group of four.},

abstract={Automatic recognition of activities of daily living (ADL) can be applied to realize services to support user life such as elderly monitoring, energy-saving home appliance control, and health support. In particular, “real-time” ADL recognition is essential to realize such a service that the system needs to know the user's current activity. There are many studies on ADL recognition. However, none of these studies address all of the following problems: (1) privacy intrusion due to the utilization of high privacy-invasive devices such as cameras and microphones; (2) limited number of recognizable activities; (3) low recognition accuracy; (4) high deployment and maintenance costs due to many sensors used; and (5) long recognition time. In our prior work, we proposed a system which solves the problems (1)- (4) to some extent by using user's position data and power consumption data of home electric appliances. In this paper, aiming to solve all the above problems including (5), we propose a new system by extending our prior work. To realize “real-time” ADL recognition while keeping good recognition accuracy, we developed new power meters with higher sensing frequency and introduced new techniques such as adding new features, selecting the best subset of the features, and selecting the best training dataset used for machine learning. We collected the sensor data in our smart home facility for 11 days, and applied the proposed method to these sensor data. As a result, the proposed method achieved accuracy of 79.393% in recognizing 10 types of ADLs.},

abstract={Activity recognition using smartphone has great potential in many applications like healthcare, obesity management, abnormal behavior detection, public safety and security etc. Typical activity detection systems are built on to recognize a limited set of activities that are present in the training and testing environments. However, these systems require similar data distributions, activity sets and sufficient labeled training data in both training and testing phases. Therefore, inferring new activities is challenging in practical scenarios where training and testing environments are volatile, data distributions are diverge and testing environment has new set of activities with limited training samples. The shortage of labeled training data samples also degrades the activity recognition performance. In this work, we address these challenges by augmenting the Instance based Transfer Boost algorithm with k-means clustering. We evaluated our TransAct model with three public datasets - HAR, MHealth and DailyAndSports and demonstrated that our TransAct model outperforms traditional activity recognition approaches. Our experimental results show that our TransAct model achieves ≈ 81% activity detection accuracy on average.},

abstract={The proliferation of consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices offers as many convenient benefits as it poses significant vulnerabilities.

This paper proposes a central security manager that is built on top of the smarthome's hub or gateway router and positioned to intercept all traffic to and from devices. Aware of the status of all devices in the home and of reported vulnerabilities, the security manager could intervene as needed to deter or alleviate many types of security risks. Modules built atop this manager could offer convenient installation of software updates, filter traffic that might otherwise exploit devices, and strengthen authentication for both legacy and future devices. We believe that this design offers the potential to increase security for smarthome IoT devices, and we encourage other researchers and regulators to explore and extend our ideas.},

abstract={We provide a lightweight decentralized publish-subscribe framework for supporting large-scale actor communication on edge networks. Our framework, called Loquat, does not depend on any reliable central nodes (e.g., data centers), provides reliability in the face of massive node failures and network partitioning, and provides scalability as the number of nodes increases. We consider that high reliability, i.e., that send operations reach close to 100% of live destination nodes, is a critical property for communication frameworks on edge networks. But reliability is difficult to achieve in a scalable way on edge networks because of the network's dynamicity, i.e., frequent node failures and partitioning. For example, both Internet of Things networks and mobile phone networks consist of devices that are often offline. To achieve reliability, our framework is based on two hybrid gossip algorithms, namely HyParView and Plumtree. Hybrid gossip algorithms combine gossip with other distributed algorithms to achieve both efficiency and high resilience. Our current implementation is written in Erlang and has demonstrated scalability up to 1024 nodes in Amazon's cloud computing environment.},

abstract={Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.},

Edge network connectivity is often not resilient to failures, leading to data loss when network devices are isolated by the failure of a single service provider, while other providers are still functional. We propose MetroSDX, a neutral network design that increases the resiliency of edge networks and global and local services, improves isolation of network functions, and preserves data from edge devices when they are disconnected. MetroSDX is a software-defined exchange, a meet-me point for exchanging computing, storage, and networking resources.

abstract={Modern power grid has evolved from a passive network into an application of Internet of Things with numerous interconnected elements and users. In this environment, household users greatly benefit from a prediction algorithm that estimates their future power demand to help them control off-grid generation, battery storage, and power consumption. In particular, household power consumption prediction plays a pivotal role in optimal utilization of batteries used alongside photovoltaic generation, creating saving opportunities for users. Since edge devices in Internet of Things offer limited capabilities, the computational complexity and memory and energy consumption of the prediction algorithms are capped. In this paper we forecast 24-hour demand from power consumption, weather, and time data, using Support Vector Regression models, and compare it to state-of-the-art prediction methods such as Linear Regression and persistence. We use power consumption traces from real datasets and a Raspberry Pi 3 embedded computer as testbed to evaluate the resource-accuracy trade-off. Our study reveals that Support Vector Regression is able to achieve 21% less prediction error on average compared to Linear Regression, which translates into 16% more cost savings for users when using residential batteries with photovoltaic generation.},

abstract={With the various technological advances, mobile devices are not just being used as a means to make voice calls; but are being used to accomplish a variety of tasks. Mobile devices are being envisioned to practically accomplish any task which could be done on a computer. This is hurdled by the limited computational resources available with the mobile devices due to their portable size. With the mobile devices being connected to the Internet, leveraging cloud services is being seen as a promising solution to overcome this hurdle. Computationally intensive tasks can be offloaded to the Cloud servers. However, owing to the latency and cost associated with using cloud services, edge devices (termed cloudlets) stationed near the mobile devices are being seen as a prospective alternative to replace/assist the Cloud services. The mobile devices have an easier access to the cloudlets being situated in their vicinity and can offload their task requests to them to be served at a lower cost. This paper considers a network of such connected cloudlets which provide service to the mobile devices in a given area. We address the issue of task assignment in such a scenario (i.e. which cloudlet serves which mobile device) aimed towards improving the quality of service experienced by the mobile devices in terms of minimizing the latency. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed task assignment scheme showing lower latency as compared to the traditional scheme for task assignment.},

abstract={With the available sensors on mobile devices and their improved CPU and storage capability, users expect their devices to recognize the surrounding environment and to provide relevant information and/or content automatically and immediately. For such classes of real-time applications, user perception of performance is key. To enable a truly seamless experience for the user, responses to requests need to be provided with minimal user-perceived latency. Current state-of-the-art systems for these applications require offloading requests and data to the cloud. This paper proposes an approach to allow users' devices and their onboard applications to leverage resources closer to home, i.e., resources at the edge of the network. We propose to use edge-servers as specialized caches for image-recognition applications. We develop a detailed formula for the expected latency for such a cache that incorporates the effects of recognition algorithms' computation time and accuracy. We show that, counter-intuitively, large cache sizes can lead to higher latencies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that models edge-servers as caches for compute-intensive recognition applications.},

In simple terms, IoT boils down to convergence in the sense of technology and people coming together or merging. In legal terms, this IoT convergence has parallels in concepts such as accession, commixture, confusion and comingling. These legal concepts have broadly speaking, the same application within the context of property law, where property law includes real property such as land, moveable property such as chattels or things (including human tissue), and tangible and intangible property (intellectual property).},

abstract={The use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has grown significantly in the past decade. While IoT is expected to improve life for many by enabling smart living spaces, the number of security risks that consumers and businesses will face is also increasing. A high number of vulnerable IoT devices are prone to attacks and easy exploit. Existing research has focused on security that must be implemented by administrators and manufacturers to be effective. Our work focuses on a system that does not rely on best practices by IoT device companies, but rather allows inexperienced users to be confident about the security of the devices that they add to their network. We present an implementation of an IoT architectural framework based on Software Defined Networking (SDN). In this architecture, IoT devices attempting to join an IoT network are scanned for vulnerabilities using custom vulnerability scanners and penetration testing tools before being allowed to communicate with any other device. In the case that a vulnerability is detected, the system will try to fix the vulnerability. If the fix fails, then the user will be alerted to the vulnerability and provided with suggestions for fixing it before it will be allowed to join the network. Our implementation demonstrates that the approach works and causes minimal overhead to the network once the device is deemed trustworthy.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as “miner” that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.},

abstract={Internet of Things is a connected ecosystem where everyday objects have network connectivity allowing them to do data transfers. This scenario often involves a gateway for enabling the communication between things which are connected to the internet. Gateways run multiple network based services in them which are often visible to any device in the same network. It acts as the entry point for the traffic to and from the local IoT network. Usually security of such devices is neglected and left unguarded making them prime targets for hackers. Portguard is an authentication tool developed with the intention of hiding those services that are up and running in the gateway from any external attackers. Any application/middleware servers or edge/sensor nodes attempting to connect to the services in the gateway will be authenticated prior to granting access to the gateway services. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of portguard against popular attacks.},

abstract={Shoulder surfing or adversarial eavesdropping to infer users' keystrokes on physical QWERTY keyboards continues to be a serious privacy threat. Despite this, practical and efficient countermeasures against such attacks are still lacking. In this paper, we propose keyboard randomization as a simple, yet effective, countermeasure against various types of keystroke inference attacks. Our proposal consists of several keyboard randomization strategies which randomizes or changes the position of keys on the keyboard. The randomized keyboard is then projected to the typing user by means of an augmented reality wearable device. As the randomized keyboard is visually superimposed over the actual physical keyboard, and is visible only to the typing user through the augmented reality device, it acts as an effective countermeasure against both side-channel and visual-channel based keystroke inference attacks. We implement our proposed solution on a commercially available augmented reality device and conduct preliminary evaluations to validate its performance and effectiveness.},

year={2017}, 
volume={},

pages={642-647}, 
abstract={Secure wireless communication based applications in IoT typically require very short sessions. Stream ciphers constitute a popular choice for ensuring security of data communications in such applications. To keep the cost, complexity and energy expenditure in the implementation of such stream cipher algorithms low, the short duration of the wireless communication sessions are often exploited by using a lightweight cryptographic (LWC) algorithm. Such an LWC algorithm will provide the desired security during the short session at the required speed, and a new key will be used for the next session so that an adversary would not have enough time to decipher the key of any session. In this paper, we propose a technique based on generating stream of random keys from streaming twitter data. The sequence of random keys generated by the proposed tweet-based key generation (TBKG) algorithm has been tested by the NIST statistical test suite for randomness. The test results show that TBKG algorithm passes all the fifteen tests for randomness. Also, the period of the key values is quite high, thus making it suitable for use over short sessions involving communication of 350 MB data through the wireless network. The unpredictability of the generated random key values is governed by the unpredictable nature of the tweets from thousands of individuals. The algorithm is very simple to implement with low computational and energy overhead.},

pages={648-653}, 
abstract={Sensors are important components in the Internet of Things (IoT) that encompass a wide spectrum of applications from healthcare to monitoring critical infrastructure. Securely gathering sensor measurements by adopting traditional cryptographic mechanisms is fraught with vulnerabilities emanating from the inability to safeguard secrets on edge devices, often in adversarial environments, where appropriate hardware protection logic and power consumption overheads are counterproductive to the desire to keep the devices low cost and long lasting. This paper continues recent efforts into investigating an alternative secure sensing approach with the potential to provide a solution for resource-restricted IoT devices. In particular, we investigate the possibility to exploit unreliability of a physical unclonable function (PUF) resulting from its sensitivity to variations in supply voltage conditions to guarantee the veracity of physical measurements from potentially any transducer capable of converting a physical phenomenon to a voltage signal. Therefore we present an approach that has the potential to realize a universal PUF sensor where the PUF itself acts as a sensor or is integrated with a sensor. Thus, for a PUF sensor, cryptographic processes and sensing are inseparable. Further, we rely on a dominant external condition-voltage-responsible for unreliability to secure sensing. We validate the feasibility of the proposed universal PUF sensor approach based on experimental data extracted from RO-PUFs (Ring Oscillator PUFs).},

To mitigate these limitations, we present a trustworthy management of TCB measurements called TM-Coin (TCB Measurement-Coin) using the blockchain and ARM TrustZone. The TM-Coin transactions and protocol are presented to manage the TCB measurements of IoT devices using the blockchain, a decentralized database. The trusted execution environment provided by ARM TrustZone is used as the TCB to generate the TM-Coin transactions securely. Based on TM-Coin, the verifiers launch remote attestation of sensed data from the devices using the TCB measurements published in the blockchain without attesting to the TCB. We implemented a prototype to evaluate the performance overhead caused by TM-Coin.},

In recent time the proliferation of commodity smart healthcare appliances and stand-alone and integrated sensing devices (Internet of Things) make it increasingly easier to ubiquitously and continuously monitor an individuals health-related vital signals, activities, and behaviors to provide just-in-time interventions for the aging population. Nevertheless, developing reliable and clinically equivalent point-of-care technologies to perform automated health assessment and intervention remain challenging. In this talk, I will discuss how signal processing and machine learning techniques help analyze the activity and physiological signals to gauge the cognitive and behavioral health of older adults.

We introduce a statistical method to address this need. In this study, we used Fitbit Charge Heart Rate devices with two separate populations to continuously record data. There were eight participants in the healthy control group and nine in the hospitalized inpatient rehabilitation group. We performed comparisons both within the groups and between groups on the gathered step count and heart rate data. The inpatient rehabilitation group showed improved step count changes between the first half of the study participation and the second half.

abstract={Stress plays a major role in physical and emotional well-being, and is associated with several illnesses including depression, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. College student stress as a construct is important to detect in order to equip students in a timely manner with stress coping strategies. However, the lack of a passive sensing measure accepted as a gold standard impedes real time detection and treatment of stress. Many researchers are studying passive sensing of stress using wrist-worn sensors; however, this effort focuses on understanding the essential features of wrist-worn sensors in detecting stress, and how to best induce stress in a lab setting. Applying machine learning methods increasingly is making it feasible to validly infer in real time through passive sensing of physical features psychological states, such as stress. Given strong participant adherence to wrist-worn sensors, this paper focuses on analyzing the effect of replacing other body sensing platforms (e.g. chest-based heart rate) with their wrist-worn equivalent on stress prediction accuracy. Nine participants were equipped with multiple body sensors and were asked to wear a commercially available Android smartwatch, a custom-designed smartwatch equipped with a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor, a chest-based heart rate sensor, and a finger-based commercial GSR sensor. Based on participant self-reports, singing experiment showed greatest stress levels across participants. This paper further analyzes features for prediction from all sensors compared to wrist-worn only sensors. Using statistical features on one-minute fixed-time sub-divisions and correlation-based feature subset selection and a Random Forest model, the system is capable of detecting stress with 88.8% F-measure.},

These information objects and their applications are known as quantified-self, mobile health or personal informatics, and they can be used to provide a deeper insight into our behavior. To our knowledge, existing personal assistant systems do not support all types of quantified-self queries. In response to this, we have undertaken a user study to analyze a set of “textual questions/queries” that users have used to search their quantified-self or mobile health data. Through analyzing these questions, we have constructed a light-weight natural language based query interface - including a text parser algorithm and a user interface - to process the users' queries that have been used for searching quantified-self information. This query interface has been designed to operate on small devices, i.e. smartwatches, as well as augmenting the personal assistant systems by allowing them to process end users' natural language queries about their quantified-self data.},

abstract={Due to numerous benefits, sensor-rich smartwatches and wrist-worn wearable devices are quickly gaining popularity. The popularity of these devices also raises privacy concerns. In this paper we explore one such privacy concern: the possibility of extracting the location of a user's touch-event on a smartphone, using the inertial sensor data of a smartwatch worn by the user on the same arm. This is a major concern not only because it might be possible for an attacker to extract private and sensitive information from the inputs provided but also because the attack mode utilises a device (smartwatch) that is distinct from the device being attacked (smartphone). Through a user study we find that such attacks are possible. Specifically, we can infer the user's entry pattern on a qwerty keyboard, with an error bound of ±2 neighboring keys, with 73.85% accuracy. As a possible preventive mechanism, we also show that adding a little white noise to inertial sensor data can reduce the inference accuracy by almost 30%, without affecting the accuracy of macro-gesture recognition.},

abstract={Wearable physical sensor signal processing-based activity recognition has profound impacts on context-aware remote healthcare and cognitive reasoning. Different nodes of Body Sensor Network (BSN) are involved with different contexts that limits single BSN sensor based context recognition models into a sole extreme. On the other hand, multiple physical sensors based context recognition systems are suffered with disrupted BSN network connectivity, multi-modal sensor signal processing complexity, multi-sensor device implantation and fault intolerance. To mitigate these problems, we postulate a sparse-deconvolution aided single BSN sensor-based multi-label physical activity recognition framework. We first consider a single physical sensor device is attached to individual's wrist node i.e., one of the upper extreme body nodes. We hypothesize that the final sensor signals of upper extreme nodes are affected by the lower extreme nodes contexts with an approximately sparse factor (ASF). Based on the hypothesis, we postulate (a) a sparse deconvolution method on the upper extreme node signals to disaggregate ASF and original signals; and design (b) a hybrid classification model to detect both upper extreme (such as, hand waving, hand shaking etc.) and lower extreme (such as, walking, standing, running etc.) activities. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework with three real-time dataset with distinct characteristics (a real-time collected activity dataset in a controlled lab environment, a real-time smart home system deployed in a retirement community center -(IRB #HP-00064387) and a publicly available dataset) which corroborates a radical improvement in recognizing multi-label human activities.},

pages={697-702}, 
abstract={In this work, an end-to-end indoor routing and guiding solution, `InLocW' (InLoc - Wearable) is discussed. The initial location fix of the user is obtained using an infrastructure of BLE beacons. Primary focus is on continuous calculation of instantaneous walking direction (a primary arrow displayed on the smartwatch) based on user's current location estimated by a particle filter which runs in the back end. A solution is devised to synchronize these directions to user's walking, thereby solving the problem of inherent latency between estimated and actual user's location in a PDR system. Another major contribution of this work is a preventive measure against the deviation of user from the path, for which a secondary arrow is displayed on the smartwatch to inform the user of any impending turn well before the turn itself. Also a correction module is implemented which re-routes the user back to the correct path in case any deviation from the optimum path is detected, which constitutes another major contribution. The overall system works without any dependence on a smartphone, or any involvement of user with the smartwatch during routing, thereby allowing them to walk without any distractions, and just follow the displayed directions. The system has been tested on paths with multiple turns and has proved to be efficient in preventing deviations from the routing path, and ensuring a smooth movement of user from source to the selected destination with high reliability.},

abstract={Indoor Positioning is a crucial topic to provide autonomous services to people based on their location. Nowadays dominating positioning systems, like GPS (Global Positioning System), are designed for outdoor use not applicable for indoor scenarios as they depend on a direct line of sight to reference stations. Recent progress in wearable computing peaked in the promising development of SmartWatches. They are seen as a successor of the SmartPhone evoking a new era of an always on, large scale, planet spanning, body sensor network. This work investigates in the question if SmartWatches are an accurate and suitable approach for an out of the lab, 24/7, real world Indoor Positioning System. In utilising Wi-Fi fingerprinting methodologies in combination with machine learning techniques, it is shown that state of the art consumer hardware in form of SmartWatches can be used to shape a cost effective, unobtrusive, and accurate indoor positioning system.},
