title={Keynote: Context, big data, and digital prejudices}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-1}, 
abstract={In pervasive computing research and literature, context has mostly been seen as an information source for applications that adapt their behavior according to the current situation of their user or their (often physical) environment. This adaptation could be the change of the user interface, the performance of actions (like sending messages or triggering actuators), or the change of used resources (like network bandwidth or processing power). To determine relevant situations, many heterogeneous data sources could be used, ranging from sensor data over mined patterns in files to explicit user input. Since most sensors are not perfect, context quality has to be considered. And since many context-aware applications are mobile, the set of data sources may change during runtime. According to the widely used definition by Anind Dey, context can be “any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity”. In the past years, we have seen a significant increase in the so-called “big data” domain, in research, technology, and industrial usage. The desire to analyze, gain knowledge and use more and more data it in new ways is rising in a way that resemble a gold rush. Data is the new oil. Beside applications like predictive maintenance of machines or optimization of industrial processes, a main target for big data analyses are humans - in their roles as travelers, current or potential clients, or application users. We could say that big data is “any information that can be used to characterize the situation of a user”, and relate these approaches to what have been done in context modelling and reasoning. This gets even clearer when these analyses leave the virtual world (e.g., client behavior in web shops) and enter the real world (e.g., client behavior in retail). In addition to the ambiguities of the analysis itself that only leads to predictions with a limited probability, sensor data quality becomes an is- ue: the sensor data might be inaccurate, outdated or conflicting with other observations or physical laws; in addition, sensor data processing algorithms like object classification or tracking might lead to ambiguous results. In this talk, we will shortly review these two domains and derive what could be learned for context-aware applications. A special focus will be given on quality of context on all semantic levels, and how the improper consideration of quality issues can lead to dangerous digital prejudices.},

abstract={With the advancement in wireless sensor networks (WSN) researchers in social network analysis (SNA) now have access to larger and more complex datasets that describe human interactions in the physical space. Studies in WSN thrive on accuracy and robustness whereas SNA operates on a higher level of data abstraction. Graph mining is a bridge between these two fields. This paper investigates two approaches to graph mining and compares their efficiency and appropriateness as the input systems for a social interaction analysis process.},

title={Knowledge-assisted location-adaptive technique for indoor-outdoor detection in e-learning}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={8-13}, 
abstract={The era of pervasive and ubiquitous computing has brought the learning far beyond the traditional classrooms to distant and mobile e-learning. Being easily accessible through time and place, e-learning systems rushed into masses and quickly appeared under the criticism as being uni-directional and fitting various learners under “one size”. In order to differentiate learners' needs and to apply the most suitable educational approach to the particular learner, researchers have introduced the Learner's context - a set of preferences defined by the learner's personal characteristics, technical capabilities of the user device, and the environment where learning takes place. Concerning the physical learning environment, the basic requirement is to distinguish between indoors and outdoors (IO). Existing approaches for IO-detection either apply pre-defined hard-coded thresholds to the sensing parameters or use machine-learning techniques. While the latter demonstrates a more adaptive approach for IO-detection over the former, decisions based on training data are not accurate once the environment is significantly changed, which is highly relevant for the modern learner with increased mobility. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-assisted location-adaptive technique for IO-detection in e-learning scenarios. The technique leverages data collected from various ambient sensors such as light, temperature, humidity, and noise and compares them with characteristics that the e-learning environment has at this point in time and in the current physical location being inside or outside. Here, we model the e-learning environment based on the empirical observations of the natural learning process augmented by the knowledge about current weather and environmental conditions collected from the weather web-service. The proposed approach is easily adaptable to the changing conditions in time and place with no need for the training phase. This work can be the first- step towards robust location-adaptable IO-detection algorithms.},

year={2015},

pages={14-19}, 
abstract={Human sensing is a notion of crowd-sourcing whereby ICT devices are utilized for data collection. Human Sensor Web (HSW) is a network of people who interact with their devices in order to forward their observations to a designated receiving server in the form of messages (such as SMS and USSD). It capitalizes on the accessibility of ICT tools (such as mobile phones) by non-experts to use them as sensory nodes in order to generate useful data regarding various location-oriented phenomena - such as the status of public service facilities. We presumed and tested that with the controlled use of its context, the smartness of the HSW can be boosted. The smart system uses context to make intelligent analysis such as credibility assessment of user-generated data and context-aware retrieval of geo-information, which would have been impossible otherwise. In this paper, we proposed and tested a software architecture to achieve this goal. We deployed the design solution on a mobile reporting system for functionality of water points in rural Tanzania under the SEMA project. The context-enabled smart system has been developed based on latest semantic technologies and linked data principles.},

abstract={In the recent years, smart home projects started to gain great attention from academic as well as industrial communities. However, an essential challenge that all smart home ideas face is the provision of the ground truth i.e. the labeled training data required to train the machine learning algorithms which achieve the smartness of the smart home. Another challenging task is to evaluate the correctness of the collected ground truth so that we can be sure that we train the system with correct data which represents the reality. In order to build a smart home which is interactive and adaptable to the behavior and preferences of its inhabitants, we need to have comprehensive information about the everyday behavior and preferences of the inhabitants of the smart home. This comprehensive information which needs to be collected represents the ground truth in the context of our smart home research. Many technologies have been utilized in order to collect this information. In this paper, we present our approach for collecting the ground truth in smart homes in a nonintrusive way. More importantly, we present our methodology for evaluating the correctness of the collected ground truth.},

abstract={Mobile devices have become ubiquitous, with their adoption being driven by their immediacy and sensing capabilities. Applications or apps that run on a portable computing device have recently surged in popularity. An increasing number of mobile apps and their diverse users make it difficult to select the correct app to respond to evolving situations. To address this issue, we have developed a semantic framework for mobile apps named the Situation Aware Mobile Apps Framework (SAMAF) that can achieve the goal of dynamic and automated adaptive apps for software systems responding to the mobile users' context and environmental changes. In this paper, we have implemented the SAMAF system. An assessment of the prototype of the SAMAF system has been conducted from the perspective of performance and adaptability.},

abstract={Workflows are an established IT concept to achieve business goals in a reliable and robust manner. However, the dynamic nature of modern information systems, the upcoming Industry 4.0, and the Internet of Things increase the complexity of modeling robust workflows significantly as various kinds of situations, such as the failure of a production system, have to be considered explicitly. Consequently, modeling workflows in a situation-aware manner is a complex challenge that quickly results in big unmanageable workflow models. To overcome these issues, we present an approach that allows workflows to become situation-aware to automatically adapt their behavior according to the situation they are in. The approach is based on aggregated context information, which has been an important research topic in the last decade to capture information about an environment. We introduce a system that derives high-level situations from lower-level context and sensor information. A situation can be used by different situation-aware workflows to adapt to the current situation in their execution environment. SitOPT enables the detection of situations using different situation-recognition systems, exchange of information about detected situations, optimization of the situation-recognition, and runtime adaption and optimization of situation-aware workflows based on the recognized situations.},

abstract={The rapid market shift to multi-functional mobile devices has created an opportunity to support activity recognition using the on-board sensors of these devices. Over the last decade, many activity recognition approaches have been proposed for various activities in different settings. Wearable sensors and augmented environments potentially have better accuracy, however performing activity recognition on user mobile devices has also attracted significant attention. This is because of less requirements on the environments and easier application deployment. Many solutions have been proposed by academia, but practical use is limited to testbed experiments. In 2013, Google released an activity recognition service on Android, putting this technology to the test. With its enormous market share, the impact is significant. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of this activity recognition service and share the lesson learnt. Through our experiments, we found scenarios in which the recognition accuracy was barely acceptable. To improve its accuracy, we developed ARshell in which we apply a Markov smoother to post-process the results generated by the recognition service. Our evaluation experiments show significant improvement in accuracy when compared to the original results. As a contribution to the community, we open-sourced ARshell on GitHub for application developers who are interested in this activity recognition service.},

abstract={Increasing numbers of sensors are being deployed in environments to monitor our behaviours and environmental phenomena. Missing data is an inevitable problem in almost every sensorised environment, due to physical failure, poor connection, or dislodgement. This results in an incomplete view of the real-world, leading to poor prediction and consequently, degraded quality of system services. This paper explores generic solutions towards detecting missing data on event-driven sensors using both temporal correlation and time series analysis. The solutions are evaluated on a real-world dataset and achieve promising results with accuracy around 80%.},

Middleware typically provides abstractions for common tasks such as atomicity, synchronization and communication with the intention of isolating the developers of distributed applications from lower-level details of the underlying platforms. Developing middleware to meet the performance constraints of applications is an important challenge. Although one would like to develop generic middleware services which can be used in a variety of different applications, efficiency considerations often force developers to design middleware and algorithms customized to specific operational contexts. This presentation will discuss techniques to design middleware that is customizable to suit the performance needs of specific applications. We also discuss the challenges poised in designing middleware for pervasive sensor networks and cyber-physical systems.},

pages={57-62}, 
abstract={Leg swelling produced by retention of fluid in leg tissues is known as peripheral edema, which is regarded as a symptom for various systematic diseases such as heart or kidney failure. In current clinical practice, edema is manually assessed by clinical experts. Such an assessment can often be inaccurate and unreliable especially if it is made by different operators at different times. Despite the importance of monitoring edema for the purpose of evaluating the course of disease or the effect of treatment, quantifying peripheral edema in a continuous and accurate fashion has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a wearable real-time platform (namely, Smart-Cuff), which integrates advanced technologies in sensing, computation, and signal processing and machine learning for continuous and real-time edema monitoring in remote and in-home settings. Given that peripheral edema is highly dependent on various contextual attributes such as body posture, we present an activity-sensitive approach to discard erroneous or contextually invalid sensor data in order to meet the requirements of both energy efficiency and quality of information. Examination of our hardware prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed force-sensitive resistor-based edema sensor (with an R2 of 0.97 for our regression model) as well as the activity monitoring mechanism (over 99% accuracy) that provide the means to perform reliable data sanity check on ankle circumference measurements in a continuous manner.},

abstract={Social networks, such as Twitter, carry important information on ongoing events and as such can be viewed as networks of sensors that monitor and report events in the physical world. In this paper, we concern ourselves with the challenge of event localization from Twitter feeds. We explore the quality of information that can be derived either directly or indirectly from microblog entries regarding locations of ongoing events. Contrary to prior work that used Twitter to map regions of large-footprint events, or derived coarse-grained location information, in this paper, we are interested in point-events, such as building fires or car accidents, and aim to pin-point them down to a street address. An algorithm is presented that identifies distinct event signatures in the blogosphere, clusters microblogs based on events they describe, and analyzes the resulting clusters for fine-grained location indicators. An exact event location is then derived by fusing these indicators. To evaluate the quality of derived location information, we use road-traffic-related Twitter feeds from 3 major cities in California and compare automatic event localization within our service to manually obtained ground truth data. Results show a great correspondence between our automatically determined locations and ground-truth.},

abstract={The Quality of Information (QoI) in Participatory Sensing (PS) systems largely depends on the location accuracy of participating users. However, users could easily provide false information through Location Spoofing Attacks (LSA). Existing PS systems are not able to efficiently validate the position of users in large-scale outdoor environments, thus being prone to reduced QoI. In this paper we present an efficient scheme to secure PS systems from LSAs. In particular, the user location is verified with the help of mobile WiFi hot spots (MHSs), which are users activating WiFi interface on their smart phones and waiting connections from nearby users, and thereby validating their position inside the sensing area. A reputation-based algorithm is proposed to rule out sensing reports of location-spoofing users, thereby increasing the reliability of the PS system. The effectiveness of our scheme is analyzed by real-world experiments and simulation study.},

year={2015}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={87-92}, 
abstract={Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is considered promising for ubiquitous communication on roadways and one-hop broadcast plays a leading basic role in VANET. Thus, there is a strong need of high reliability related to packet transmission and reception especially when VANET is used for life-safety applications. Though IEEE 802.11p has been defined as an international standard for VANET, IEEE 802.11p has in practice some limitations in terms of reliability. Therefore, a new MAC protocol named Mobile Slotted Aloha (MS-Aloha) has been proposed and developed by ISMB in Italy to achieve higher reliability and MS-Aloha has become recommended by ETSI after evaluation. However, because of inefficient use of radio channels, the reliability of MS-Aloha is still not satisfying especially under very congested traffic conditions in urban area. In this paper, we propose a new MAC protocol named Reliable TDMA-based One-hop Broadcast (RTOB). RTOB is based on MS-Aloha, inheriting all its advantages, and RTOB can achieve much higher reliability by making efficient use of radio channels. We also propose a novel metric named Cover Ratio (CR) which is more appropriate than the conventional Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) to evaluate reliability from the viewpoint of life-safety applications. This paper describes in detail the main principles and the techniques of RTOB and demonstrates quantitatively its sufficiently high reliability in terms of both CR and PDR by clarifying efficient use of radio channels even under very congested traffic conditions.},

volume={},

pages={93-98}, 
abstract={This paper proposes a modified version of vehicular ad hoc network media access control (VeMAC) protocol for further increased throughput. In the modified VeMAC, an additional bit is appended to the field for each time slot in the header used in VeMAC as the collision flag. Upon detecting a collision for a time slot, a node sets the collision flag for that time slot without changing the ID field and sends its packet in its acquired time slot. By receiving the packet with the collision flag, nodes notice a collision happen in the time slot. One of the nodes involved in the collision knows from its ID field that it is the node itself that is supposed to use the time slot, and therefore it continues to use the time slot. The other nodes recognize themselves as nodes that should not use the time slot because their IDs are not included in its ID field of the packet. Consequently, they release the time slot and begin by acquiring new time slots. Since not all nodes involved in the collision release the time slot in our modified VeMAC, the possibility that access collisions following the merging collision happen is reduced, compared to the original one. Simulation results show that our modified one outperforms the original one in terms of the average number of collisions and throughput.},

pages={99-104}, 
abstract={The size of data exchanged via the Internet and the number of Wi-Fi devices have been increasing, and the amount of data traffic will continue to increase in the future. Thus, ensuring the communication capacity of wireless LANs is one of the most important issues. By reducing communication coverage of each wireless LAN access point (AP) and densely deploying APs, it is possible to improve the communication capacity of the wireless LAN. However, the communication capacity decreases due to frequent interference between APs when they are densely deployed. If neighboring APs can use different channels, interference between APs can be avoided. However, if the number of available channels is limited, it is difficult to improve the communication capacity by increasing the density of APs. For further improving the communication capacity of wireless LANs, the management and control of the APs on the same channel is important. In this paper, we present an architecture in which multiple APs working on the same channel concurrently transmit frames avoiding interference to improve the throughput. In the architecture, a device called an aggregator is introduced. All APs are connected to the aggregator, and the aggregator is connected to a wired LAN. The aggregator schedules downstream frames so as to increase the number of concurrent transmissions from multiple access points to different STAs in the area. It calculates SINR of APs and mobile hosts, and schedules concurrent transmissions. To this end, the aggregator obtains the location of the mobile hosts through the visible light communication or some other means. When there is only downstream traffic, simulation results show that the proposed architecture improves the throughput about 10% compared to the normal IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN.},

abstract={Lately, pervasive and ubiquitous computing services have been under focus of not only the research community, but developers as well. Different devices generate different types of data with different frequencies. Emergency, healthcare, and latency sensitive services require real-time response. Also, it is necessary to decide what type of data is to be uploaded in the cloud, without burdening the core network and the cloud. For this purpose, Fog computing plays an important role. Fog resides between underlying IoTs and the cloud. Its purpose is to manage resources, perform data filtration, preprocessing, and security measures. For this purpose, Fog requires an effective and efficient resource management framework, which we provide in this paper. Moreover, since Fog has to deal with mobile nodes and IoTs, which involves objects and devices of different types, having a fluctuating connectivity behavior. All such types of service customers have an unpredictable relinquish probability, since any object or device can quit resource utilization at any moment. In our proposed methodology for resource estimation and management, we have taken into account these factors and formulate resource management on the basis of fluctuating relinquish probability of the customer, service type, service price, and variance of the relinquish probability. Implementation of our system was done using Java, while evaluation was done on CloudSim toolkit. The discussion and results show that these factors can help service provider estimate the right amount of resources, according to each type of service customers.},

abstract={There are some cases regarding information propagation over a wide area, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, in which an end-to-end path does not exist, due to the non-uniform density of vehicles. In order to solve this problem, Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) architectures have been studied to facilitate message delivery in V2V communications. However, existing message delivery methods for the purpose of information sharing do not consider the efficiency of message passing communications. As a result, information can be lost, due to a decrease in the efficiency of information propagation. In order to increase the efficiency of information propagation, we propose a vehicle clustering algorithm, based on the similarity of geographic locations and trajectories. This contributes to efficient message passing communication. In order to evaluate our proposal, we carry out a simulation. The simulation results confirm that our proposed method provides higher message reachability, and utilizes bandwidth more efficiency than existing methods.},

abstract={The advent of multi-interface smart radio devices brings the flexibility of simultaneous access to multiple heterogeneous access networks (ANs) for making a significant improvement in the network utilization by balancing the network load and avoiding congestion. However, each heterogeneous access technology poses its own constraints in terms of data rate, coverage, availability, latency, packet loss rate, usage price etc. Thus, a novel selection mechanism must be devised to exploit the “best” available access network(s) to best serve the wireless users. Assuming users can ask for a required amount of bandwidth from the ANs, we model the heterogeneous access network selection mechanism from a game theoretic perspective by formulating a user preference based utility expression using three major parameters: expected data rate, latency, and usage cost. Then we analyze the utility model to find the users' optimal bandwidth demands from the selected ANs that maximize their net payoff. Theoretical analysis of the utility expression proves the existence of optimal bandwidth demand in the single and multiple network selection, and we derive the open/closed form expression for optimal bandwidth too. The results from the simulations conducted corroborate the theoretical optimal bandwidth and number of packets assigned for the selected network(s) with the corresponding experimental values.},

In this context of general mobility of objects, mobile personal devices (smart phones, tablets, etc.) are well suited as the universal providers of Internet connectivity and location information for simpler smart objects that lack location sensors and have only short-range wireless interfaces. This paper describes Mobile Hub (M-Hub), a generic mobile middleware for IoMT, its design and prototype implementation for Android and Bluetooth. The Mobile Hub extends our previous mobile-cloud communication middleware SDDL, so that it is able to provide scalable and reliable mobile communication and data processing capabilities to mobile smart objects. Preliminary experiments have shown that our implementation of M-Hub delivers good mobility responsiveness and that the concept is suitable for IoT applications that require opportunistic discovery and connection to a variety of mobile Smart Objects.},

abstract={There has been a significant increase in recent years in the volume and diversity of streams of data, data streams from sensors, data streams arising from the analysis of content or data mining, right through to user generated Twitter streams. There has been a corresponding increase in demand for more real-time analysis of these streams in order to spot significant events and trends of interest to an individual or business. This has resulted in an increased need to achieve efficient temporal reasoning upon the streams. In this paper, we present a novel approach to perform temporal reasoning on real time streams of data using Semantic Web Technologies so that we could derive more valuable information by taking account of the time dimension. Moreover, in order to deal with such high-frequency data, several filter mechanisms have been implemented to, significantly, improve the performance of the reasoning process. In order to illustrate and evaluate the approach, the real-time analysis of Twitter data is taken as a concrete use case for such data streams.},

abstract={Regarding service oriented architectures various tool chains evolved in the last decades. However, in terms of content-centric approaches tools and middleware are in an early stage. Especially tool support for name-centric services in future heterogeneous networks is not available. Future networks will cover future Internet, wireless sensor networks, mobile and ubiquitous applications. Existing content-centric networking provides powerful, flexible, but heavyweight APIs to the developers but does not cover middleware and tool chains for services. Therefore, we implement a solution for application development with name-centric services based on an existing content-centric networking protocol. We design a lightweight service description based on JSON which is short and can be easily understood. We implement a complete tool chain for automatic code generation for server and client applications. We demonstrate the workflow, the convenience for the application developer and the effectiveness of our approach in a convincing application example. A first evaluation of the code generation reveals a prediction of logical lines of code and illustrates the complexity of the problem that is now solved automatically. Our approach is proven to simplify and advance the application development process for name-centric services.},

pages={141-141}, 
abstract={Early detection and intervention are essential for preventing clinical deterioration in patients. We are developing a two-tiered clinical warning system designed to identify the signs of clinical deterioration and provide early warning of serious clinical events at general hospital units. The first tier of the system automatically identifies patients at risk of clinical deterioration from existing electronic medical record databases. The second tier performs real-time clinical event detection based on vital sign data collected from on-body wireless sensors attached to those high-risk patients. Wireless sensor networks play an important role in clinical warning by collecting real-time vital signs for clinical decision support. This talk presents the architecture of, and our experiences with, a large-scale wireless clinical monitoring system. Our system encompasses portable wireless pulse oximeters, a wireless relay network spanning multiple hospital floors, and integration with electronic medical record databases. We report our experience and lessons learned from a 14-month clinical trial of the system in six hospital wards of Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Our experiences show the feasibility of achieving reliable vital sign collection using a wireless sensor network integrated with hospital IT infrastructure and procedures. We highlight technical and non-technical elements that pose challenges in a real-world hospital environment and provide guidelines for successful and efficient deployment of similar systems. The convergence of wireless sensors, mobile computing, data mining and electronic medical record in clinical warning systems will lead to enhanced quality of care for patients in hospitals as well as outpatients in their everyday lives.},

abstract={With the increasing popularity of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs), users have shared information about places they have visited, creating a link between the real world (their movements on the globe) and the virtual world (what they express about these movements on the LBSNs). In this article, we propose the SiST model, which contains information captured from different dimensions (Social, Spatial and Temporal). The proposed model is a graph that links two users, as long as both of them are friends and have published that they were at the same place within a predefined time interval. In addition to movement patterns that can be extracted using SiST, this model may be used to predict if two users will meet in a short time span by executing a classification algorithm. Performance tests were conducted with SiST networks that were built based on three real LBSN datasets. Results indicated that it is possible to forecast with high accuracy (ranging from 80.50% to 96.32%) whether two people will meet or not using two days of historical data.},

pages={148-153}, 
abstract={This paper presents an application model for augmenting TV viewing experience. The augmentation consists of additional media resources, which are linked to the Web according to the user profile and to TV metadata. Instead of asking the user for such data, a distributed software system captures them non-intrusively, processes the user and TV program context, and automatically searches for and delivers the context-aware resources to the viewer either on the TV screen or on a second screen. The use of TV metadata as context data is a remarkable feature in this work. Such metadata are carried in the MPEG-2 Transport Stream, which is part of the major digital TV systems in the world. This work deals with problems such as inconsistency of TV metadata, and ineffectiveness of Web search, which could frustrate the viewer's enriched experience. The research indicates that context-aware applications in the television domain should strongly take into account TV metadata captured opportunistically from broadcast streams, in addition to traditional context data, such as location, temperature, device capabilities, among others. The solutions presented in this paper point to a minimum-effort by the TV user, enabling a more useful, easier and more attractive Integrated TV-Internet viewing experience.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have several uses in civilians and military applications, such as search and rescue missions, cartography and terrain exploration, industrial plant control, surveillance, public security, firefight, and others. Swarms of UAVs may further increase the effectiveness of these tasks, since they enable larger coverage, more accurate or redundant sensed data, fault tolerance, etc. Swarms of aerial robots require real-time coordination, which is just a specific case of M2M collaboration. But one of the biggest challenges of UAV swarming is that this real-time coordination has to happen in a wide-area setting where it is expensive, or even impossible, to set up a dedicated wireless infrastructure for this purpose. Instead, one has to resort to conventional 3G/4G wireless networks, where communication latencies are in the range of 50-150 ms. In this paper we tackle the problem of UAV swarm formation and maintenance in areas covered by such mobile network, and propose a bandwidth-efficient multi-robot coordination algorithm for these settings. The coordination algorithm was implemented on the top of our mobile middleware SDDL, uses its group-cast communication capability, and was tested with simulated UAVs.},

In this paper we introduce DisCoPar, our component based system inspired by flow-based programming, that aims to provide a component library for constructing citizen observatories. Due to the high reconfigurability and reusability on different levels of our system, we ensure that all the features of a citizen observatory can be implemented. This includes data gathering features of currently existing participatory sensing applications, data aggregation methods, and participant coordination. This participant coordination and collaboration is facilitated due to the highly reactive nature of our flow-based system.},

abstract={Developing web-based as well as mobile platforms to encourage citizens to become involved in urban governance and political decision-making processes is becoming increasingly popular amongst municipalities and organisations. However, the vast majority of them either implement a one-way communication between citizens and governance or tends to be more of a consultation process instead of actively integrating citizens in decision-making. Our research aims to strengthen citizens' involvement in governance and encourage a continuous dialogue between municipalities and citizens. To explore the opportunities and impacts of novel mobile participation concepts, we developed a mobile application. This paper reports on two consecutive studies, which evaluate and explore user acceptance of general concepts of our system. Being still in the development phase, we focused on specific features of the prototype. Results of both studies are presented and discussed in relation to opportunities for m-participation tools.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a video-based metropolitan positioning system (V-MPS) for providing centimeter-grade localization in vehicular networks. The V-MPS system integrates vehicular networks with installed roadside/intersection cameras to provide positioning information to vehicles on the road. V-MPS can estimate the precise position of a vehicle and detect the located lane for each vehicle. To the best of our knowledge, V-MPS is the first positioning system which provides the following features: 1) it achieves the centimeter-grade positioning accuracy for vehicular networks that can detect the located lanes of vehicles, 2) it employs existing roadside/intersection cameras that can keep additional construction cost low, and 3) it establishes an innovative infrastructure for applications of next-generation Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) that can make lane-level traffic control, collision avoidance, and vehicle navigation possible. With vehicular networks, the estimated positions can be broadcast to nearby vehicles. With roadside/intersection cameras, the lane positions of vehicles can be detected even if GPS is not accurate enough to provide lane-level localization. In addition, the traffic condition can be continually monitored to optimize driving efficiency for next-generation ITS. This paper demonstrates our current prototype.},

abstract={The life expectancy is rapidly growing in many countries. According to the United Nations, the percentage of elderly population will rise from 5% in 2013 to 11% in 2050. The increasing aging of the population implies an increase of age-related diseases, and an increase in terms of health-care costs. The innovations introduced by pervasive computing, and in particular by sensor-based activity monitoring methods, can be exploited to early detect the onset of health issues. For this reason, we devised a novel method to recognize anomalies that a senior performs during the execution of activities of daily living, based on data acquired from unobtrusive sensors deployed at home. The objective is to support the clinicians in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, providing them with fine-grained information about abnormal behaviors. In this paper, we present a demonstration of the method, based on a graphical tool that simulates the execution of activities and abnormal behaviors of an elderly person in a sensor-rich smart home.},

abstract={This paper describes a demonstration of an application called MoodChat. This application is built to showcase the Grapevine context sharing middleware. Grapevine provides a very lightweight but potentially lossy way to efficiently share context information among a group of co-located pervasive computing devices using just device-to-device connections to exchange small bits of context information. Further, Grapevine embodies abstractions that allow flexible definition of context-defined groups, i.e., clusters of co-located users that are similar in some way based on their context values. MoodChat uses Grapevine to share context about device users' personal states (i.e., mood), including an individual's own assessment of his mood but also values sensed about the device or environment that might also be indicative of the user's mood (e.g., the level of ambient sound, the number and length of sent or received text messages, etc.). Co-located users with the same assessed level of mood are connected into groups, and users within the same group can chat with one another. The demonstration will allow the visitors to interact in MoodChat as one of the users, showing how context-defined groups can enable a wide range of flexible pervasive computing applications.},

abstract={Acoustic sensing has influenced many applications in green building energy management, such as designing multi-modal energy disaggregation algorithms through fine-grained appliance state identifications or efficiently controlling the HVAC system based on the occupancy of the environment. In this demo paper we build a low-cost system prototype using off-the-shelf commercially available hardware (Raspberry Pi and super high gain microphone) to handle both acoustic sensing and its processing that is portable and easily deployable in any indoor environment. Our system is useful in detecting appliance noise for fine-grained energy metering and human voice for managing building energy footprint. We use the decibel strength of the sound to determine if it should be filtered out as a silence or stored in as an audio of interest. A fast fourier transform that quickly converts the sinusoidal input of the audio signals into its associated frequencies is implemented along with the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) feature to distinguish between a human voice and an appliance noise. We also implement all the computations on-chip to quantify the energy-delay benefits.},

abstract={Pervasive systems present stringent requirements that make software deployment especially challenging. The unknown and fluctuating environment in which pervasive applications are executed discards traditional approaches. As a result, there is an increasing need for a reproducible and dynamic deployment process. In last years, we developed several industrial pervasive platforms and applications. Based on these experiences we propose Rondo, a tool suite for deploying pervasive applications. Rondo includes a domain-specific language for declaratively describing applications, a deployment manager that can dynamically apply these descriptions and development tools for helping the description of applications. In this paper we present this tool suite and a set of deployment scenarios in which we validated our approach, including a web framework and a home automation platform.},

abstract={The past years has seen the emergence and fast growing of various wearable devices, such as smart watches, wrist bands, rings, glasses, jewelry, garments, etc. Although wearable devices have a wide usage scope, healthcare is one of the most promising field which is being exploited by a number of big enterprises and research institutes. However, existing healthcare related wearable products usually work individually. There is almost no data transmission or information exchange between different kinds of devices, which prevents data fusion of multiple devices and development of upper layer healthcare applications. In this demo, we present WearableHUB, a mobile phone based open pervasive wearable data fusion platform for personal health management. WearableHUB can transform multimodal data (motion data, physiological indices, etc.) into unified format according to predefined standard. Other than traditional wearable computing system, WearableHUB not only can get preloaded function results from different devices based on module library according to data type and device position, but also can trigger and get dynamic online downloaded APP function base on fusing multimodal data and extracting higher level information.},

abstract={Modern smartphones are increasingly equipped with mul-ticore processors. However, current applications are yet to take full advantage of this new architecture, particularly in the area of managing power consumption. This demo demonstrates three new scheduling algorithms that dynamically schedule an optimal number of cores with each core running at an optimal frequency. A unique feature of these scheduling algorithms is that they take into account the tradeoff between power consumption, performance and user experience. They achieve the best tradeoff under the current context. A prototype implementation on a quad-core HTC One smartohone shows that these algorithms result in significant reduction in power consumption while ensuring good performance and user experience. The demo includes several different popular smartphone applications such as video streaming using YouTube, Candy Crush game, audio streaming using Pandora, navigation using Google Maps, and converting video from .avi to .mp4 format. Users can run these applications using one of the three new scheduling algorithms under different tradeoff scenarios and observe the amount of power savings achieved by the new algorithms.},

pages={223-224}, 
abstract={This demonstration presents Inviz, a low-cost gesture recognition system that uses flexible textile-based capacitive sensors. Gestures are recognized using proximity-based movement detection using flexible capacitive sensor arrays that can be built into the environment or placed on to the body or be integrated into clothing. Inviz provides an innovative interface to home automation systems to simplify environmental control for individuals with limited-mobility resulting from paralysis, paresis, and degenerative diseases. Proximity-based sensing obviates the need for physical contact which can result in skin abrasion which is particularly deleterious to people with limited-to-no sensitivity in their extremities. A custom-designed wireless module maintains a small form factor facilitating placement based on an individual's needs. Our system leverages a hierarchical sensing technique which facilitates learning gestures based on the individual and placement of the sensors. Classification uses just-in-time embedded computational resources to provide accurate responses while maintaining a low average power consumption, in turn reducing the impact of batteries on the form factor. To illustrate the use of Inviz in a smart home environment, we demonstrate an end-to-end home automation system that controls small appliances. We will interface our system with a home automation gateway to demonstrate a subset of potential applications. This interactive demonstration highlights the intuitiveness and extensibility of the Inviz prototype.},

pages={233-235}, 
abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming increasingly common in a wide variety of settings. Since most sensor nodes are powered by batteries, energy efficiency is critical. In this paper, we investigate problems that cause short battery life in WSNs from two perspectives. First, from the perspective of the execution forms of sensors in a sensor node, we note that simultaneous sensor activation generates high peak power consumption. Therefore, battery voltage drops quickly, and sensors stop working even though some useful charge remains in the battery. Second, from the perspective of wireless communication, communication distances must be considered in minimizing energy consumption. Moreover, the energy hole problem, which is known to cause non-uniform energy drains in many communication topologies, results in premature termination of entire networks. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to describe novel approaches for separately solving the aforementioned problems in order to extend the lifetime of WSNs.},

pages={239-241}, 
abstract={With the proliferation of sensors, specifically those capable of providing positional estimates, it is now possible to build large sensor networks for the purpose of tracking objects within indoor environments. A key component of building such indoor tracking systems, is the ability to properly select a subset of these available sensors for the purpose of tracking. Often sensors do not afford the luxury of a priori mapping or calibration, specifically mobile sensors, and thus the resulting positional data may prove to be untrustworthy or unreliable. Current indoor tracking efforts do not consider trust and reliability as separate criteria for the sensor selection process. This identification and further classification of both trust and reliability is a challenging task due to the unpredictable and unknown nature of both the sensors and the physical environment in which they reside. This proposal defines trust and reliability in the scope of indoor tracking, attempts to quantify both parameters, provides a framework to improve the sensor subset selection process through the inclusion of these parameters, and makes use of an objective function to evaluate the tradeoff between accuracy and cost. We will make use of an existing indoor tracking system to empirically evaluate this proposal.},

abstract={All visions of pervasive computing share the idea of smart, small, and cheap devices that improve our everyday life. Their applications typically fall under sensor-based communication-enabled autonomous and deeply embedded monitor and control systems. But common smart sensors and deeply embedded controllers are also able to do many things that we do not want. In fact, they will be always vulnerable to doing the bidding of attackers, to the detriment of their owners. This work presents a concept of a security architecture for tiny scale devices, which are typically close to the physical elements and featured with very limited resources. The concept describes a compile- and run-time co-design process to bring a tailor-made implementation of well-understood technologies of desktop systems on this type of devices to enforce an adequate security level.},

User activity pattern can give an abstraction and summarization about physical behavior for certain group of people. However, one of the biggest challenges in this topic that we are facing today is the big data problem associated with large, complex, and dynamic data. In addition, as the demand for the integration and analysis of dynamic data as well as static historical data from different sources has been growing steadily, smartphones with limited capacity and computing abilities can hardly manage and process such a huge task. To address these above issues, a new framework has to be used to assist in the process, analysis, and integration of big data for a mobile platform. In this paper, I propose a distributed cloud based pervasive framework to help do complicated computing for a mobile platform. The framework has the ability to collect, process, analyze, and integrate different types of data from different sources by using state-of-the-art technologies. The purpose of this framework is to provide an intelligent and efficient approach to analyze and combine new incoming data with historical data to build and refine a solid user activity pattern.},

By decoupling location detection from LBSs, CrumblR liberates users from disclosing their locations to individual service providers. Our platform relies on opportunistic sharing of wireless signal fingerprints with nearby places to enable discovery of proxemic services associated with the place.

abstract={This paper presents an algorithm for processing Connect-the-Dots puzzles. In particular, the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and other image processing algorithms to process pre-existing Connect-the-Dots puzzles is explored. An algorithm was developed which utilizes Matlab and C# to locate and identify the numbers in the puzzles. To test the accuracy of the algorithm an experiment was conducted using 20 hand selected puzzles from an online source. The function of the algorithm was evaluated by visually capturing the make-up of the puzzles and comparing them to the results generated by the algorithm. Results show that the algorithm has promise of great accuracy with the implementation of small improvements. The proposed research will aid in the development of an application that will provide educational benefits to children in an emergent technological world.},

abstract={As sensors become more affordable and versatile, more and more sensors are deployed in different environments to help people observe their surroundings. However, due to their various physical structures, it is very challenging to have a universal schema to identify, search, and query sensors and sensors' data. Fortunately, there are two main approaches to address some of these problems, namely Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) from W3C and Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) from the Open Geospa-tial Consortium (OSG). Both utilize XML to extend sensors' metadata and let machines understand the semantic meaning of a sensor. However, even though they provide a universal way to describe and deliver high-level sensor information, neither enable the querying of historical data. In this paper, we briefly examine the current semantic sensor web developments, SNN and SWE along with their advantages and challenges. Then we present our extensions to enable querying historical data within the semantic sensor domain that we call QueryML. QueryML can be used to extend the capabilities of either SSN or SWE to support querying historical data.},

abstract={Tracking travel patterns and modes is useful on many levels. Prior efforts to collect this information have been stymied by low accuracies or reliance on supplementary devices. One technique to overcome low accuracies is to use prompted recall, in which the user is prompted to supply the ground truth for automatically generated information. However, prompted recall increases the burden on the user, which could lead to low adoption or high drop out rates. Using techniques from behavioral economics, and prompting directly on the smartphone can reduce user burden, and also increase engagement for ongoing data collection. In this paper, we describe a system that improves accuracy by using behavioral techniques for prompted recall on the smartphone, and aggregates the information to help detect large scale patterns. We also present the evaluation of a prototype implementation that was used to collect data from 44 unpaid volunteers in the San Francisco Bay Area over 3 months and compute their transportation carbon footprint.},

abstract={We here propose geographical proximity based target-group formation algorithm to efficiently distribute advertisement messages of social-commerce services with device-to-device (D2D) communications. The convergence of D2D communications and the social-commerce services is able to invoke synergistic effects because the D2D users can voluntarily relay the messages to their neighbor users to obtain a great deal of discounts for the corresponding products. By using both the angular distances among target-areas and the physical distances between the D2D access point and the target-areas, we make target-groups for efficient D2D advertisement dissemination. Through intensive simulations, we evaluate the performances of our algorithm with respect to the total number of successfully received users, the average number of relay users, and transmission efficiency compared with the conventional algorithm with cell sectorization based target-group formation.},

abstract={Identification of Public Bus Stops and characterising their waiting time is of significance in the domain of Intelligent Transportation System and public interest. Surveys suggest that the existing systems and algorithms cannot be merely replicated in the context of developing regions, because of the kind of heterogeneity and chaotic situation prevalent in their transport system, in contrast to the orderly and much regulated system of the developed world. Moreover a significant fraction of population residing here is not so tech-savvy, hence crowd-sourced based strategies renders useless. Either novel algorithms/techniques are required or the existing ones have to undergo suitable adaptation and innovation to suit the contrasting characteristics of developing regions. Using customized hardware we present the stoppage pattern analysis of public bus GPS traces of more than 2000 km for a 20 km route of Durgapur, a suburban city (West Bengal, India). We have revealed that 53.03 % of the travel time for the selected route has higher predictability with Standard deviation of 30.73%.},

abstract={Challenged networking applications such as rural internet, battlefield communication, post-disaster communication etc. cannot rely on mere DTN for its unpredictable delay and unreliable delivery probability. To meet application specific QoS constraints, in addition to DTN-enabled mobile nodes (smart phones/tablets), an ad hoc backbone infrastructure is essential. Such backbone components include the use of laptops or custom-built storage units as Information Dropboxes and/or Data Mules and wireless mesh, long range Wi-Fi etc. as long range wireless communication units. Evaluation of such systems through simulation is not enough as there are problems related to compatibility and interoperability. Hence design of a testbed for evaluating a DTN-based hybrid system is a non-trivial problem. In this paper we attempt to reveal some of the system related challenges/issues for above and present DTHN-Test, a low-cost testbed prototype developed for evaluating challenged network scenarios, in general. As a case study we show some initial results on performance of a Delay-constrained Four-Tier Hybrid Ad hoc Network Architecture using DTHN-Test.},

abstract={Predicting the location of a user in indoor settings in a practical and energy-efficient manner is (still) a very non-trivial task. The latest challenge in indoor localization is not to design specialized sensors but to design and implement practical data fusion methods using the already available technologies. Current state-of-the-art indoor localization techniques utilize Wi-Fi and a variety of sensors inside smart phones to predict user location. Some also require site-specific input such as indoor floor plans or the location of Wi-Fi access points. In this paper, we propose to use physical (PHY) layer information from 4G cellular network signals such as Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) to logically predict user location. Since the cellular signals are received by the smart phones at no additional cost, our methodology is very energy-efficient. We implement a prototype system in Android and evaluated it over 60 indoor locations. The prediction accuracy ranged up to 91% with an average localization error of less than 2.3m for any combination of 4G PHY layer information. The results show promise for improvements in current indoor localization systems using cellular signals.},

Recently, mocking techniques have been used in mobile environments to increase the user privacy and their goal is to allow users to select the kind of information they want to pass to the application (if real or randomly generated). This work presents MockingBird, a novel solution to mocking that uses recorded context-traces instead of randomly generated data, which is easily detected by applications. We also propose a flexible methodology to mock an Android application that does not require any changes at the operating system level and at the virtual machine level. MockingBird is a very promising solution; we are currently testing its performance and increasing its functionality.},

abstract={Green building applications need efficient and finegrained determination of power consumption pattern of a wide variety of consumer-grade appliances through non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques. Fine-grained monitoring of everyday appliances can provide better feedback to the consumers and motivate them to change behavior in order to reduce their energy usage. It also helps to detect abnormal power consumption events, long-term appliance malfunctions and potential safety concerns. Commercially available plug meters can be used for individual appliance monitoring but for an entire house, each such individual plug meters are expensive and tedious to setup. In practice, deploying smart plug based NILM and acquiring the low-level power measures of a large number of devices is often difficult or impossible due to the deployment complexity and varying characteristics of devices and thus must instead be employed at the circuit or house-level and inferred through the incorporation of novel usage-based measurement and probabilistic level-based disaggregation algorithm. But the challenges in deploying non-intrusive load monitoring algorithm involve disaggregating individual devices consumption from the aggregate power measurement, as well as modeling and incorporating the usage based prediction. In this talk, I will discuss on advanced machine learning and data analytics algorithms that capture the measurement based approach and circuit level NILM with the autonomous profiling and prediction logic, and the significant practical impact of intelligent use of such profiling techniques for green building applications. Our approach help improve the performance of energy disaggregation algorithms and provide critical insights on appliance longevity, abnormal power consumption, consumer behavior and their everyday lifestyle activities. The performance of our proposed algorithms on real data traces will be presented. I will conclude this talk with our ongoing research pro- ects in this area and future research directions.},

abstract={With the help of smart metering valuable information of the appliance usage can be retrieved. In detail, nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), also called load disaggregation, tries to identify appliances in the power draw of an household. In this paper an unsupervised load disaggregation approach is proposed that works without a priori knowledge about appliances. The proposed algorithm works autonomously in real time. The number of used appliances and the corresponding appliance models are learned in operation and are progressively updated. The proposed algorithm is considering each useful and suitable detected power state. The algorithm tries to detect power states corresponding to on/off appliances as well as to multi-state appliances based on active power measurements in 1s resolution. We evaluated the novel introduced load disaggregation approach on real world data by testing the possibility to disaggregate energy demand on appliance level.},

abstract={Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) plays an important role in energy management and energy reduction in buildings and homes. An NILM system does not need a large amount of deployed power meters to monitor the power usage of home devices. Instead, only one meter on the main power line is necessary to detect and identify the operating devices. There are many approaches to solve the problem of device determination in NILM. The features applied in low-frequency based approach essentially include the step-change (or edge) and the steady state. This paper introduces three algorithms to solve the l1-norm minimization problem in NILM and results on power measurements obtained from a real appliance deployment. With a small number of devices, the obtained precision varies from 75% to 99%, depending on the tolerance criterion to determine the steady state of a given device.},

abstract={Home energy management systems have become more widely available due to the continued emphasis on environmental consciousness, the increased implementations of smart grids/smart meters, and the desire to have more control over one's home. A key challenge in designing effective home energy management systems is understanding the underlying causes that impact home energy consumption. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present results from an interview-based study of 22 households in Baltimore City, Maryland, across a wide range of income groups, occupant types (age, number of home occupants, and occupation), and house types (rentals and user-owned). Using a semi-structured interviewing process, we present several insights regarding home energy consumption that impact the usage and effectiveness of current and future systems. As an example, we find that non-human occupants, such as pets, significantly influence home energy consumption. Additionally, household dynamics and hierarchy, as well as routine behavior and individual habits, produce significant decision making challenges for an energy management system. Finally, problems with home insulation and appliance age are seen as fiscally insurmountable, suggesting that newer, cheaper, and readily available retrofit solutions would be beneficial.},

Support vector machines are utilized to forecast the energy demand for each individual household participating in the system via a developed cloud application. An aggregator then accumulates the predicted demand for a local micro-grid to determine peak demand. The hourly electricity prices are then estimated and sent to the consumers to affect their electricity usage during peak hours. The consumer's response to the real time energy price is observed through meter readings using Green Button API.},

Self-dimming ceiling lights were made individually controllable and a novel building management system (BMS) was implemented. Every two desks and a nearby light were grouped in a cell, implicitly defined by rules of the BMS. Based on the intervention, energy savings of up to 19.01 kWh/m2·year were obtained.

abstract={In this paper we assess about the recognition of User Interaction events when handling electrical devices. This work is placed in the context of Intrusive Load Monitoring used for appliance recognition. ILM implies several Smart Metering Sensors to be placed inside the environment under analysis (in our case we have one Smart Metering Sensor per device). Our existing system is able to recognise the appliance class (as coffee machine, printer, etc.) and the sequence of states (typically Active / Non-Active) by using Hidden Markov Models as machine learning algorithm. In this paper we add a new layer to our system architecture called User Interaction Layer, aimed to infer the moments (called User Interaction events) during which the user interacts with the appliance. This layer uses as input the information coming from HMM (i.e. the recognised appliance class and the sequence of states). The User Interaction events are derived from the analysis of the transitions in the sequences of states and a ruled-based system adds or removes these events depending on the recognised class. Finally we compare the list of events with the ground truth and we obtain three different accuracy rates: (i) 96.3% when the correct model and the real sequence of states are known a priori, (ii) 82.5% when only the correct model is known and (iii) 80.5% with no a priori information.},

Smart technologies also offer possibilities for assisting in real-time with rehabilitation and proactive health interventions. This keynote will discuss issues of importance in creating technologies that can be translated into clinical practice. For example, improving clinical translation of smart technologies for use by health-care professionals will require demonstrating that developed health-related algorithms are reliable and valid, easily visualized and of value in clinical decision-making. The clinical translation of prompting interventions will require answers to questions regarding the best timing, content and delivery of prompts in addition to issues related to motivation and the changing clinical needs of patients. These points and others will be illustrated with examples from our research using sensor data and machine learning techniques to develop algorithms that recognize activities, provide insights on functional status and automate interventions.},

abstract={Applying machine learning methods in scenarios involving smart homes is a complex task. The many possible variations of sensors, feature representations, machine learning algorithms, middle-ware architectures, reasoning/decision schemes, and interactive strategies make research and development tasks non-trivial to solve. In this paper, the use of a portable, flexible and holistic smart home demonstrator is proposed to facilitate iterative development and the acquisition of feedback when testing in regard to the above-mentioned issues. Specifically, the focus in this paper is on scenarios involving anomaly detection and response. First a model for anomaly detection is trained with simulated data representing a priori knowledge pertaining to a person living in an apartment. Then a reasoning mechanism uses the trained model to infer and plan a reaction to deviating activities. Reactions are carried out by a mobile interactive robot to investigate if a detected anomaly constitutes a true emergency. The implemented demonstrator was able to detect and respond properly in 18 of 20 trials featuring normal and deviating activity patterns, suggesting the feasibility of the proposed approach for such scenarios.},

abstract={Development, testing and validation of algorithms for smart home applications are often complex, expensive and tedious processes. Research on simulation of resident activity patterns in Smart Homes is an active research area and facilitates development of algorithms of smart home applications. However, the simulation of passive infrared (PIR) sensors is often used in a static fashion by generating equidistant events while an intended occupant is within sensor proximity. This paper suggests the combination of avatar-based control and probabilistic sampling in order to increase realism of the simulated data. The number of PIR events during a time interval is assumed to be Poisson distributed and this assumption is used in the simulation of Smart Home data. Results suggest that the proposed approach increase realism of simulated data, however results also indicate that improvements could be achieved using the geometric distribution as a model for the number of PIR events during a time interval.},

abstract={Sensor-based activity monitoring systems promise to prolong independent living of frail elderly people, including those affected by cognitive disorders. Different solutions are already available on the market, which use wireless sensors installed in the home to track the daily living routines of the senior. Those systems provide caregivers with statistics about detected activities; some of them may trigger real-time notifications when they identify a risk situation. Long-term monitoring of finegrained behavioral anomalies can be an important tool to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, current commercial systems can only monitor high-level activity routines. For this reason, in a previous work we devised a novel method to recognize fine-grained abnormal behaviors of elderly people at home based on sensor data. Experiments in the lab showed the effectiveness of that method. In this paper we present our experience about the implementation of the system in the home of an elderly person with diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. After illustrating the current implementation, we discuss preliminary results and outline research directions. In particular, a preliminary clinician's assessment indicates the potential utility of this system to support the diagnosis, and the benefits that would be gained by extending the system to monitor additional parameters, including neurovegetative aspects and motor behavior. We also discuss directions for addressing the encountered technological issues, for improving our reasoning algorithms with more extensive support of uncertainty, and for “closing the loop” by making the senior an active part of the system.},

pages={354-359}, 
abstract={To realize smart homes with sophisticated services including energy-saving context-aware appliance control in homes and elderly monitoring systems, automatic recognition of human activities in homes is essential. Several daily activity recognition methods have been proposed so far, but most of them still have issues to be solved such as high deployment cost due to many sensors and/or violation of users' feeling of privacy due to use of cameras. Moreover, many activity recognition methods using wearable sensors have been proposed, but they focus on simple human activities like walking, running, etc. and it is difficult to use these methods for recognition of various complex activities in homes. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based method for recognizing various daily activities in homes using only positioning sensors equipped by inhabitants and power meters attached to appliances. To efficiently collect training data for constructing a recognition model, we have developed a tool which visualizes a time series of sensor data and facilitates a user to put labels (activity types) to a specified time interval of the sensor data. We obtain training samples by dividing the extracted training data by a fixed time window and calculating for each sample position and power consumptions averaged over a time window as feature values. Then, the obtained samples are used to construct an activity recognition model by machine learning. Targeting six different activities (watching TV, taking a meal, cooking, reading a book, washing dishes, and other), we applied our proposed method to the sensor data collected in a smart home testbed. As a result, our method recognized 6 different activities with precision of about 85% and recall of about 82%.},

abstract={In urban crossroad areas the traffic flow is commonly not efficient. This results in an unnecessary high traffic density within cities and a resulting environmental pollution by the waste of fuel. To improve this situation, the driver should be enabled to better slow down, to better accelerate, to better decide, to better come in and to better follow within crossroads. This can be achieved by a C2X-based crossroads assistant that brings information about crossroads with lanes and traffic lights on time to the driver to decide on a convenient crossing strategy. Within this paper we introduce our concept for such a crossroads assistant that is based on newly standardized C2X message types. We have developed a novel graphical user interface for interpreting this new information sources in an intuitive, informative but not distractive way to the driver. A first prototype is already implemented and under test.},

abstract={Efficient evacuation of large buildings which seat more than twenty thousand people is a major challenge for building management authorities. Although many enterprise buildings have access control to count those entering various areas, such controls need to be switched off at times of emergency to avoid people getting trapped at a particular location. Hence, counting people during evacuation remains largely manual and error prone. Also, last known location based on access control from business management systems can be erroneous due to issues like tail gating. Accurate people counters like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) often prove costly in large deployments. In this paper we present “SmartEvacTrak”, a low-cost evacuation system which can count people entering and exiting with over 98% accuracy and can also localize people at a coarse level with around 97% accuracy, from results obtained from an evacuation experiment performed on a set of 350+ people randomly exiting a building.},

abstract={Mobile crowdsensing for rural applications is an emerging trend in developing regions. Rewarding mechanisms are warranted for the adoption of this paradigm for rural applications. Towards this end, we first develop a novel event based Rural Participatory Sensing (RuPS) framework for agricultural crop monitoring which rewards farmers based on their participation levels. To the best of our knowledge, our work is first-of-a-kind in designing reward mechanisms for rural participatory sensing. In particular, we propose a novel Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) based rewarding scheme which incorporates event-centric and GIS attributes for agricultural applications. We envision that this domain-specific rewarding scheme will be suitable for the RuPS framework to motivate farmers to participate. Participants reported events related to the citrus crop for a three-month period, using the RuPS mobile application. Based on the quantity and quality of sensing data contributed we develop a ranking scheme using MCDM methods. We conclude that the TOPSIS-AHP based ranking scheme provides the best performance score resolution in comparison with other MCDM based schemes and advocate its use for ranking participants in a RuPS framework.},

abstract={This paper presents a sound collection system to visualize environmental sounds that are collected using a crowd-sourcing approach. An analysis of physical features is generally used to analyze sound properties; however, human beings not only analyze but also emotionally connect to sounds. If we want to visualize the sounds according to the characteristics of the listener, we need to collect not only the raw sound, but also the subjective feelings associated with them. For this purpose, we developed a sound collection system using a crowdsourcing approach to collect physical sounds, their statistics, and subjective evaluations simultaneously. We then conducted a sound collection experiment using the developed system on ten participants. We collected 6,257 samples of equivalent loudness levels and their locations, and 516 samples of sounds and their locations. Subjective evaluations by the participants are also included in the data. Next, we tried to visualize the sound on a map. The loudness levels are visualized as a color map and the sounds are visualized as icons which indicate the sound type. Finally, we conducted a discrimination experiment on the sound to implement a function of automatic conversion from sounds to appropriate icons. The classifier is trained on the basis of the GMM-UBM (Gaussian Mixture Model and Universal Background Model) method. Experimental results show that the F-measure is 0.52 and the AUC is 0.79.},

In this paper, we present a middleware, called the Pervasive Middleware for Activity Recognition (PEMAR) that aims to increase the level of physical activity by creating a middleware for active games on mobile devices. For the PEMAR application, we present a human centered and adaptive approach that recognizes and learns human activities continuously by employing an activity library. The activity models in the library will be annotated with patterns of human activities and their contexts for general usage of activity models. This will be beneficial to many pervasive applications in terms of the availability of the accurate activity models as well as the reduction of burden for gesture training. The PEMAR middleware is composed of the following: (1) semantic models for human activity, (2) activity analysis, (3) activity recognition, (4) adaptation of motion models, and (5) motion based game applications. We evaluate the proposed PEMAR model in terms of its recognition accuracy and performance. In addition, we demonstrate the usage of the middleware through interactive activity gaming applications.},

abstract={Miniaturization and form factor reduction in wearable computers leads to enhanced wearability. Power optimization typically translates to form factor reduction, hence of paramount importance. This paper demonstrates power consumption analysis obtained for various operating modes in circuits suitable for wearable computers which are typically equipped with sensors that provide time series data (e.g., acceleration, ECG). Dynamic time warping (DTW) is considered a suitable signal processing technique for wearable computers, particularly due to its lower computational complexity requirement and the robustness to speed variations (acceleration and de-acceleration) in time series data. Wearable computers usually have very low computational performance requirements, which is explored in this work to minimize the system level energy consumption. We provide a comparison among three modes of operations, namely minimum energy operating point (MEOP), minimum voltage operation point (MVOP) and nominal voltage operating point (NVOP) all leveraging sleep transistors when circuits are inactive. The results show that the MVOP, in conjunction with sleep transistors, provides the least energy budget and leads to a reduction in energy consumption compared to the MEO, which is known as a suitable operating mode for ultra-low power circuits.},

Firstly, we detect stationary stance phase using accelerometers and gyro sensors. Then, based on this information, we estimate the “Angle of Inclination” (AoI) and stability of the ground. Moreover, we estimate whether the road surface is flat or not(unstable or unpaved (covered by gravel rubble or dirt) otherwise) based on variance of AoI. In addition, as for small undulation of surface due to dips, humps and bumps, which is hard to recognize only by a few samplings, we rely on continuous sensing data aggregated spatially from multiple users based on dead-reckoning techniques. We have developed a prototype of the proposed method. In the experiments, we show that our method cannot estimate not only walking steps correctly and but also AoIs of roads in rough trends.},

abstract={Many studies have reported that older adults with glaucoma experience mobility issues due to gait difficulties. These include walking slowly and bumping into obstacles, which increase the risk of falls in glaucoma patients. In this paper, we design and develop a shoe-integrated sensing system as well as signal processing and machine learning algorithms to objectively quantify gait patterns in glaucoma patients. The sensor platform was utilized in a randomized clinical trial involving 9 glaucoma patients and 10 age-matched healthy participants performing a series of gait tests. Sensor signals are collected wirelessly and processed on a local computer. With the captured data, we develop data analysis techniques to make a comparison between gait characteristics in older adults with or without glaucoma. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system achieved an accuracy of more than 90% in distinguishing gait patterns of those with glaucoma from healthy individuals for various gait analysis tests.},

abstract={There has been immense work in past on the human activities detection and context recognition using the wearable sensing technologies. However, a more challenging problem of providing training on the activities to the users with the help of wearable sensors has not been adequately attempted. Specially, in the agriculture applications, an appropriate training to the farmers on performing the agricultural activities would result in the sustainable agriculture practices for achieving higher and better quality yield. In this paper, a novel first-of-a-kind, multimedia and wearable sensors based Agricultural Activity Training (AgriAcT) system has been proposed for the dissemination of agricultural technologies to the remotely located farmers. In the proposed system, a training video of an expert farmer performing an activity is captured along with the gesture data obtained from the wearable motion sensors from the expert's body while the activity is being performed. A trainee farmer, can learn a selected activity by watching the multimedia content of the expert performing that activity on the mobile phone and subsequently perform the activity by wearing the required motion sensors. We present a novel K-Nearest Neighbor based Agriculture Activity Performance Score (KAAPS) engine to generate an Activity performance score (AcT-Score) which suggest how efficiently the activity had been performed by the trainee as compared to the expert's performance. The exhaustive experimental results by collecting data from eight experts and ten trainees for two different activities are used to present the inferences on the impact made by the Act-Score on the performance of the trainee farmers.},

volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={445-450}, 
abstract={Tracking vehicles has many applications, especially in traffic engineering, including estimation of travel time/speed, traffic density, and Origin-Destination matrices. In this paper, we propose local alignment of mobile phone signal strength measurements to track the movement of vehicles, and demonstrate its application to travel-time estimation for a road segment. We use local alignment instead of the traditionally used global alignment to allow for vehicles changing roads. More specifically, we use local dynamic time warping (LDTW) to align the signal strength trace of a phone carried in a vehicle, to a reference trace that we had collected for the relevant road segment. The signal strength trace from a mobile phone includes the strength of the signals received from the serving cell and six neighbor cells that form a multivariate time series. We perform the alignments on these multi-dimensional time series as they provide better location specificity than the univariate time series of the strongest cell, used in existing alignment-based methods. Experiments on drive test data show that our LDTW-based algorithm yields a lower positioning error with respect to ground truth (GPS traces), than comparison methods. Application of LDTW on real world call traces, made available to us by a mobile service provider, produced travel-time estimates with an average error of 11% and significant correlation with respect to travel-times computed through manual number plate recognition of vehicles.},

abstract={Randomness in people's movements might serve to detect behavior anomalies. The concept of entropy can be used for this purpose, but its estimation is computational intensive, particularly when processing long movement histories. Moreover, disclosing such histories to third parties may violate user privacy. With a goal to keep the mobility data in the mobile device itself yet being able to measure randomness, we propose three fast entropy estimators based on Lempel-Ziv (LZ) prediction algorithms. We evaluated them with 95 movement histories of real users tracked during 9 months using GSM-based mobility data. The results show that the entropy tendencies of the approaches proposed in this work and those in the literature are the same as time evolves. Therefore, our proposed approach could potentially detect variations in the mobility patterns of the user with a lower computational cost. This allows to unveil shifts in the users mobility behavior without disclosing their sensible location data.},

abstract={Privacy is an important concern for mobile computing. Users might not understand the privacy implications of their actions and therefore not alter their behavior depending on where they move, when they do so, and who is in their surroundings. Since empirical data about the privacy behavior of users in mobile environments is limited, we conducted a survey study of ~600 users recruited from Florida State University and Craigslist. Major findings include: (1) People often exercise little caution preserving privacy in mobile computing environments; they perform similar computing tasks in public and private. (2) Privacy is orthogonal to trust; people tend to change their computing behavior more around people they know than strangers. (3) People underestimate the privacy threats of mobile apps, and comply with permission requests from apps more often than operating systems. (4) Users' understanding of privacy is different from that of the security community, suggesting opportunities for additional privacy studies.},

abstract={Social-aware pervasive networks consider the users' social behavior to overcome intermittent end-to-end connectivity, inherent to this type of networking: forwarding decisions consider local knowledge about the behavior of nodes to predict future encounters. Complex Network Analysis (CNA) has been used to support contact prediction, by aggregating connectivity graphs into less volatile social graphs. Nevertheless, the structure of such graphs is rather dynamic, since users' social behavior and interactions vary throughout their daily routines and according to their mobility. Consequently, aggregation algorithms should be able to create social graphs that reflect the resulting dynamic behavior of people. This paper discusses on human behavior-aware aggregation to allow the creation of graphs based on social variations observed in people's daily routines. By focusing on the dynamics of the network, we show that social graphs, reflecting different stages of human social behavior and mobility, are able to take advantage of the potential small-world properties of networks in different time frames, improving the performance of social-aware opportunistic forwarding.},

Idea behind development of these models come from typical daily mobility patterns a user have. Three features (location, day of the week (DoW), and time of the day (ToD)) and their combinations are used to develop these models. Knowing that not all models work well for all situations, we developed three combined models using least entropy, highest probability and ensemble. Extensive performance study is conducted to compare these models over two different mobility data sets: a CDR data and Nokia mobile data which is based on GPS. Results show that least entropy and highest probability DBNs perform the best.},

pages={475-480}, 
abstract={State-of-the-art emergency navigation approaches are designed to evacuate civilians during a disaster based on real-time decisions using a pre-defined algorithm and live sensory data. Hence, casualties caused by the poor decisions and guidance are only apparent at the end of the evacuation process and cannot then be remedied. Previous research shows that the performance of routing algorithms for evacuation purposes are sensitive to the initial distribution of evacuees, the occupancy levels, the type of disaster and its as well its locations. Thus an algorithm that performs well in one scenario may achieve bad results in another scenario. This problem is especially serious in heuristic-based routing algorithms for evacuees where results are affected by the choice of certain parameters. Therefore, this paper proposes a simulation-based evacuee routing algorithm that optimises evacuation by making use of the high computational power of cloud servers. Rather than guiding evacuees with a predetermined routing algorithm, a robust Cognitive Packet Network based algorithm is first evaluated via a cloud-based simulator in a faster-than-real-time manner, and any “simulated casualties” are then re-routed using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain new safe paths for them to exits. This approach can be iterated as long as corrective action is still possible.},

abstract={Broad band communication in international disaster response actions is becoming more and more important. The information exchange between field commanders and tactical commanders lead to a better situational awareness on all layers of disaster management. After large scale disasters the communication infrastructure is often destroyed. Setting up a communication infrastructure is essential in todays disaster response actions. As organizations in disaster response actions are not consisting of IT experts, the setup and installation has to be easy. For example [1] presents such a system. Furthermore the knowledge where to deploy wireless communication gateways and wireless relay nodes is essential. Consequently the positions of field commanders can not only be based on tactical needs but also on communication needs. In this paper we present a simulation based visualization tool which helps to evaluate deployment locations for communication equipment to achieve adequate communication coverage with respect to specific disaster related information. This allows an optimal positioning of relay nodes and field commanders in the field to ensure broad band communication in disaster response actions and thus faster help for the people.},

year={2015},

pages={487-492}, 
abstract={Evacuee routing algorithms in emergency typically adopt one single criterion to compute desired paths and ignore the specific requirements of users caused by different physical strength, mobility and level of resistance to hazard. In this paper, we present a quality of service (QoS) driven multi-path routing algorithm to provide diverse paths for different categories of evacuees. This algorithm borrows the concept of Cognitive Packet Network (CPN), which is a flexible protocol that can rapidly solve optimal solution for any user-defined goal function. Spatial information regarding the location and spread of hazards is taken into consideration to avoid that evacuees be directed towards hazardous zones. Furthermore, since previous emergency navigation algorithms are normally insensitive to sudden changes in the hazard environment such as abrupt congestion or injury of civilians, evacuees are dynamically assigned to several groups to adapt their course of action with regard to their on-going physical condition and environments. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm which is sensitive to the needs of evacuees produces better results than the use of a single metric. Simulations also show that the use of dynamic grouping to adjust the evacuees' category and routing algorithms with regard for their on-going health conditions and mobility, can achieve higher survival rates.},

pages={493-498}, 
abstract={When statistical multiplexing is used to provide connectivity to a number of client hosts through a high-delay link, the original TCP as well as TCP variants born to improve performance on those links often provide poor performance and sub-optimal QoS properties. To guarantee intra-protocol fairness, inter-protocol friendliness, low queues utilization and optimal throughput in mission-critical scenarios, Congestion Control Middleware Layer (C2ML) has been proposed as a tool for centralized and collaborative resource management. However, C2ML offers only very limited security guarantees. Because emergencies may be natural or man-provoked, in the latter case there may be interest to cut out legitimate users from the communication networks that support disaster recovery operations. In this paper we present Queue Rate Management (QRM), an Active Queue Management scheme able to provide protection from Resource Exhaustion Attacks in scenarios where access to the shared link is controlled by C2ML; the proposed algorithm checks whether a node is exceeding its allowed rate, and consequently decides whether to keep or drop packets coming from that node. We mathematically prove that with QRM the gateway queue size can never exceed the Bandwidth-Delay Product of the channel. Furthermore, we use the ns-3 simulator to compare QRM with CoDel and RED, showing how QRM provides better performance in terms of both throughput and QoS guarantees when employed with C2ML.},

abstract={This paper proposes an emergency support system (ESS) with two novel algorithms, a path finding algorithm to guide evacuees during an emergency, and a communication protocol to make the opportunistic communications (oppcoms) more effective (when observing the unnecessarily sent messages). The oppcoms uses low-cost wearable mobile nodes (i.e. smart phones) that can exchange packets at close range without help of an infrastructure. Both algorithms are based on the same idea: always to maintain the direction from hazardous areas to fire exits. The main goal of the ESS is to guide evacuees in a built environment such as in a shopping centre where fire is spreading. Our support system is evaluated with the DBES (Distributed Building Evacuation Simulator) and multiple simulations have been performed with this tool using different parameters. The results show that the enhanced emergency evacuation system can offer significant improvements for the evacuees and can achieve better results when the number of duplications is taken into account.},

Opportunistic communications among mobile devices are employed to gather and disseminate information on the emergency, such as hazard locations, and personalized evacuation directions are provided to each civilian using this partial information. We evaluate the performance of an opportunistic communications based evacuation support system in both indoor and outdoor evacuations of urban areas using simulation experiments, and show the improvement that can be offered.

If an Internet connection is unavailable, obtaining the applications necessary for communication becomes difficult because most applications are provided through the Internet by platforms such as Google Play. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for distributing applications and present its implementation. Our method uses the default Web browser and tethering function of the Android operating system. These, combined with a Web server embedded in our application, enable Internet-less application distribution.

Results show that the participants understood the system and were able to obtain the application without an Internet connection within a short span of time.},

Fog computing brings cloud resources close to the underlying devices and IoTs, which makes it ideal for latency sensitive services. Furthermore, Fog is used for offloading resource constrained devices. Our smart phone based service, known as Emergency Help Alert Mobile Cloud (E-HAMC) provides a quick way of notifying the relevant emergency dealing department, utilizing the services of Fog for offloading as well as pre-processing purposes. The service sends the location of incident and contacts the appropriate emergency dealing department automatically through already stored contact numbers. The emergency related information is then synchronized automatically from Fog to the Cloud, allowing further analysis and improvement in safety of the people and creates extended portfolio of services for the concerned authorities as well as the users. Performance in most certain scenarios is also evaluated and presented in this study, which shows the applicability of our system and its future prospects.},

abstract={In the past decades, serious natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and storms have occurred frequently worldwide with catastrophic consequences. They also helped us understand that organising and maintaining effective communication during the disaster are vital for the execution of rescue operations. As communication resources are often entirely or partially damaged by disasters, the demand for information and communication technology (ICT) services explosively increases just after the events. These situations instigate serious network traffic congestions and physical damage of ICT equipments and emergency ICT networks if uprooted as a pre-disaster network system. This article proposes a network architecture design by integrating the existing network infrastructure with the reinforcement of layers based techniques and cloud processing concepts. This resilient network architecture allows the ICT services to be launched within a reasonable short period of time of development. Furthermore, communication in a disaster is sustained by implementing a three-tier fortification of the overall network architecture which would also minimize the physical and logical redundancy for resilient and flexible ICT resources. As cloud processing will work as a parallel reinforced infrastructure, the proposed approach and network design will give new hope for the developing countries to consider cloud computing services for effectiveness and better dependability on the architecture to save ICT and humanitarian network at the time of disaster.},

abstract={Summary form only given. The talk will expound on the vision where smart-watches (and other wrist-worn devices) are not just isolated sensing platforms, but part of a sensing ecosystem that couples together multiple personal devices. While an individual smartwatch can undoubtedly capture certain gestural activities and health vitals, a far richer set of applications can be enabled by performing coordinated sensing across a distributed set of one or more wrist-worn devices and a smartphone. I will describe ongoing work that involves such coordinated sensing for both (a) newer, gestural-based interactive and immersive interfaces and (b) improved unobtrusive recognition of daily activities, and the associated challenges for three key performance metrics: energy, latency and accuracy. I will provide specific examples on how we are using (i) novel distributed sensor data pipelines to enable real-time, low-latency recognition of gestures, and (ii) smartphone and infrastructural sensing as effective contextual triggers for continuous capture of commonplace urban lifestyle activities.},

abstract={Wrist worn smart devices such as smart watches become increasingly popular. As those devices collect sensitive personal information, appropriate user authentication is necessary to prevent illegitimate accesses to those devices. However, the small form and function-based usage of those wearable devices pose a big challenge to authentication. In this paper, we study the efficacy of motion based authentication for smart wearable devices. We propose MotionAuth, a behavioral biometric authentication method, which uses a wrist worn device to collect a user's behavioral biometrics and verify the identity of the person wearing the device. MotionAuth builds a user's profile based on motion data collected from motion sensors during the training phase and applies the profile in validating the alleged user during the verification phase. We implement MotionAuth using Android platform and test its effectiveness with real world data collected in a user study involving 30 users. We tested four different gestures including simple, natural gestures. Our experimental results show that MotionAuth can achieve high accuracy (as low as 2.6% EER value) and that even simple, natural gestures such as raising/lowering an arm can be used to verify a person with pretty good accuracy.},

abstract={Surface electromyography (SEMG) systems are able to effectively sense muscle activity, irrespective of any apparent body motion, in a highly convenient and non-intrusive manner. These advantages make SEMG based systems highly attractive for use as a human computer interface. Despite such advantages, there are still a significant amount of challenges that should be resolved before such systems can be made viable. In this paper we focus on a wrist based SEMG system that is required to detect as well as recognize the gesture being made by the user. A major challenge in the detection of a gesture in an SEMG signal is the noise due to displacement of electrodes on the skin which does not belong to any of the well studied noise types. We use a bilateral filtering based approach to estimate such noise and then effectively detect the gesture signal. Next, we identify the gesture based on information contained in different frequency bands of the signal. Based on our experiments, we show that our system achieves an accuracy of 88.3% in identifying the correct gesture among rock, paper, and scissors gestures.},

abstract={Wrist worn devices (WWDs) including fitness trackers and smart watches have been successfully employed to support various applications, ranging from gesture recognition to authentication. Despite the increasing number of WWDs in the market, their limited dimensions and capabilities make their interaction design challenging. Designers struggle to downsize interactions originally designed for mobile phones, and end users wish for interactions that are easy to use. To better understand the users' concerns regarding the interaction with WWDs, we collected feedback about existing wearable bands, and analyzed the most critical issues currently faced in the interacting interaction with such devices. The analysis of the findings enabled us to derive 10 design recommendations that can aid to improve the interaction design in novel WWDs.},

abstract={In recent years, several wearable devices have been proposed for monitoring nutrition intake, tracking energy expenditure, and performing activity recognition. Long device lifetimes are critical because frequent battery replacements increase user burden and yield poor long-term compliance rates. Though countless wearable devices have been proposed in recent years with varying sensors and applications, most system flows are generalizable in terms of their major components: sampling, buffering, processing, and transmission. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate energy-efficiency optimizations for wearable devices, using the NIMON nutrition-monitoring necklace as a case study.},

abstract={Communication between deaf-mute persons and normal people is very difficult when the subjects are out of the objects' view side, or vice verse. This paper presents a hand gesture recognition system using Magic Ring (a ring-shape wearable device) instead of data glove or camera to translate the predefined hand gestures into Japanese and to accomplish remote transmission of the information/command between user groups. The hand gestures are defined based on simplified Japanese sign language. The KNN method is adopted to the pattern recognition according to the bimanual sensing data. To improve the recognition rate, three most similar pre-reserved gestures and similarity are recorded, and Euclidean distance of feature values is used to estimate the gesture similarity. According to the user survey, the system shows good usability and most of the users would like to use such a system. Moreover, in the user-dependent setting, the bimanual accuracy is 85.2%, which is our performance 7.8% by using only right hand.},

abstract={We investigate the correlation between wrist movement and freezing of the gait in Parkinsons disease. Detecting such freezes allows real-time monitoring to reduce the risk of falls in subjects with Parkinson's. While most of research focuses on placing inertial sensors on lower limb, i.e., foot, ankle, thigh, lower back, we focus on the wrist as an alternative placement. Commonly worn accessories at the wrist such as watches or wristbands are easier to be accepted and worn by elderly users, in special subjects with motor problems. Experiments on data from 11 subjects show that freezing of gait episodes can be detected using the wrist movements, with a freeze hit-rate of 90% and 83% specificity in a subject-dependent evaluation scheme. This suggests that wrist sensors can be a feasible alternative to the cumbersome placement on the legs.},

abstract={We explore the use of gesture recognition on a wrist-worn smartwatch as an enabler of an automated eating activity (and diet monitoring) system. We show, using small-scale user studies, how it is possible to use the accelerometer and gyroscope data from a smartwatch to accurately separate eating episodes from similar non-eating activities, and to additionally identify the mode of eating (i.e., using a spoon, bare hands or chopsticks). Additionally, we investigate the likelihood of automatically triggering the smartwatch's camera to capture clear images of the food being consumed, for possible offline analysis to identify what (and how much) the user is eating. Our results show both the promise and challenges of this vision: while opportune moments for capturing such useful images almost always exist in an eating episode, significant further work is needed to both (a) correctly identify the appropriate instant when the camera should be triggered and (b) reliably identify the type of food via automated analyses of such images.},

pages={591-596}, 
abstract={Recently, there has been a growing interest in the research community about using wrist-worn devices, such as smartwatches for human activity recognition, since these devices are equipped with various sensors such as an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Similarly, smartphones are already being used for activity recognition. In this paper, we study the fusion of a wrist-worn device (smartwatch) and a smartphone for human activity recognition. We evaluate these two devices for their strengths and weaknesses in recognizing various daily physical activities. We use three classifiers to recognize 13 different activities, such as smoking, eating, typing, writing, drinking coffee, giving a talk, walking, jogging, biking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, and standing. Some complex activities, such as smoking, eating, drinking coffee, giving a talk, writing, and typing cannot be recognized with a smartphone in the pocket position alone. We show that the combination of a smartwatch and a smartphone recognizes such activities with a reasonable accuracy. The recognition of such complex activities can enable well-being applications for detecting bad habits, such as smoking, missing a meal, and drinking too much coffee. We also show how to fuse information from these devices in an energy-efficient way by using low sampling rates. We make our dataset publicly available in order to make our work reproducible.},

Reducing the instances of suicides of inpatients is a problem of critical importance to both patients and healthcare providers.
