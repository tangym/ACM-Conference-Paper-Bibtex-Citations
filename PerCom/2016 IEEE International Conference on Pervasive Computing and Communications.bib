With the advent of powerful and inexpensive sensing technology the ability to study human behaviour and activity at large scale and for long periods is becoming a firm reality. Wearables and mobile devices further allow the continuous physical colocation with the users. This reality generates new challenges but also opens the door to potentially innovative ways of understanding our daily lives. In this talk we will discuss our experience in large mobile sensor deployments and in using complex network science for the analysis of mobile sensing data.

title={iFrame: Dynamic indoor map construction through automatic mobile sensing}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={1-9}, 
abstract={Many pervasive computing applications depend upon maps for navigation and support of location based services. Maps are commonly available for outdoor pervasive applications from a variety of sources. An individual can determine their location outdoors on these maps via GPS. Indoor pervasive applications may also need to know the layout of rooms, doorways and hallways of buildings, and the objects and obstacles within them, however indoor maps of buildings are less prevalent. Moreover, indoor maps may need to be dynamic and updated regularly since the layout changes when objects and obstacles are added or removed by people within the building. In this paper, we present iFrame, a dynamic approach that leverages existing mobile sensing capabilities for constructing indoor floor plans. We explore how iFrame users may collaborate and contribute to constructing 2-dimensional indoor maps by merely carrying smartphones or other mobile devices, and to allow their mobile devices to share information with other users' devices. The iFrame approach consists of four steps: 1) Abstract the unknown indoor map as a matrix; 2) Leverage collaborating mobile devices that incorporate three mobile sensing technologies - accelerometers to support dead reckoning, Bluetooth RSSI detection, and WiFi RSSI detection; 3) Combine the three methods by Curve Fit Fusion (CFF), and 4) Extend iFrame from one room to a whole building by shadow rates and anchor points analysis. We conducted a deployment study that shows iFrame is a light-weight and unattended approach that provides a skeleton map of a real building effectively and automatically. The layouts of 12 rooms are reconstructed within 5-10 minutes. Changes of layout in indoor maps can be detected and the resolution of the reconstructed indoor floor plans can be improved when there is an increase in the number of cooperating users.},

year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-9}, 
abstract={Understanding user contexts and group structures plays a central role in pervasive computing. These contexts and community structures are complex to mine from data collected in the wild due to the unprecedented growth of data, noise, uncertainties and complexities. Typical existing approaches would first extract the latent patterns to explain the human dynamics or behaviors and then use them as the way to consistently formulate numerical representations for community detection, often via a clustering method. While being able to capture highorder and complex representations, these two steps are performed separately. More importantly, they face a fundamental difficulty in determining the correct number of latent patterns and communities. This paper presents an approach that seamlessly addresses these challenges to simultaneously discover latent patterns and communities in a unified Bayesian nonparametric framework. Our Simultaneous Extraction of Context and Community (SECC) model roots in the nested Dirichlet process theory which allows nested structure to be built to explain data at multiple levels. We demonstrate our framework on three public datasets where the advantages of the proposed approach are validated.},

title={Adaptive activity learning with dynamically available context}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-11}, 
abstract={Numerous methods have been proposed to address different aspects of human activity recognition. However, most of the previous approaches are static in terms of the data sources used for the recognition task. As sensors can be added or can fail and be replaced by different types of sensors, creating an activity recognition model that is able to leverage dynamically available sensors becomes important. In this paper, we propose methods for activity learning and activity recognition adaptation in environments with dynamic sensor deployments. Specifically, we propose sensor and activity context models to address the problem of sensor heterogeneity, so that sensor readings can be pre-processed and populated into the recognition system properly. Based on those context models, we propose the learning-to-rank method for activity learning and its adaptation. To model the temporal characteristics of the human behaviours, we add temporal regularization into the learning and prediction phases. We use comprehensive datasets to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method, and show its advantage over the conventional machine learning algorithms in terms of recognition accuracy. Our method outperforms hybrid models that combine typical machine learning methods with graphical models (i.e. HMM, CRF) for temporal smoothing.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate how to network smart-phones for providing communications in disaster recovery. By bridging the gaps among different kinds of wireless networks, we have designed and implemented a system called TeamPhone, which provides smartphones the capabilities of communications in disaster recovery. Specifically, TeamPhone consists of two components: a messaging system and a self-rescue system. The messaging system integrates cellular networking, ad-hoc networking and opportunistic networking seamlessly, and enables communications among rescue workers. The self-rescue system energy-efficiently groups the smartphones of trapped survivor and sends out emergency messages so as to assist rescue operations. We have implemented TeamPhone as a prototype application on the Android platform and deployed it on off-the-shelf smartphones. Experiment results show that TeamPhone can properly fulfill communication requirements and greatly facilitate rescue operations in disaster recovery.},

title={Task phase recognition for highly mobile workers in large building complexes}, 
year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-9}, 
abstract={Being aware of activities of co-workers is a basic and vital mechanism for efficient work in highly distributed work settings. Thus, automatic recognition of the task phases the mobile workers are currently (or have been) in has many applications, e.g., efficient coordination of tasks by visualizing co-workers' task progress, automatic notifications based on context awareness, and record filing of task statuses and completions. This paper presents methods to sense and detect highly mobile workers' tasks phases in large building complexes. Large building complexes restrict the technologies available for sensing and recognizing the activities and task phases the workers currently perform as such technologies have to be easily deployable and maintainable at a large scale. The methods presented in this paper consist of features that utilize data from sensing systems which are common in large-scale indoor work environments, namely from a WiFi infrastructure providing coarse grained indoor positioning, from inertial sensors in the workers' mobile phones, and from a task management system yielding information about the scheduled tasks' start and end locations. The methods presented have low requirements on the accuracy of the indoor positioning, and thus come with low deployment and maintenance effort in real-world settings. We evaluated the proposed methods in a large hospital complex, where the highly mobile workers were recruited among the non-clinical workforce. The evaluation is based on manually labelled real-world data collected over 4 days of regular work life of the mobile workforce. The collected data yields 83 tasks in total involving 8 different orderlies from a major university hospital with a building area of 160, 000 m2. The results show that the proposed methods can distinguish accurately between the four most common task phases present in the orderlies' work routines, achieving Fi-Scores of 89.2%.},

year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-9}, 
abstract={A large number of car accidents occur at intersections every year mainly due to drivers' "illegal maneuver" or "unsafe behavior". To promote traffic safety, we present SafeCam, a smartphone-based system that jointly leverages vehicle dynamics and the real-time traffic control information (e.g., traffic signals) to detect and study driver dangerous behaviors at intersections. In particular, SafeCam uses embedded sensors (i.e., inertial sensors) on the phone to generate soft hints tracking different driving conditions while at the same time adopts vision-based algorithms to recognize intersection-related critical driving events including unsafe turns, running stop signs and running red lights. In order to improve the system efficiency, we utilize adaptive color filtering under two lighting conditions (e.g., sunny and cloudy) and deploy the subsampling methods to make a trade off between the detection rate and the processing latency. In the evaluation, we conduct real-road driving experiments involving 15 drivers and 6 vehicles. The experiment results demonstrate that SafeCam is robust and effective in real-road driving environments, and has great potential to alert drivers for their dangerous behaviors at intersections and at the same time help them shape safe driving habits. Our experiments also reveal several interesting findings. 1) On average a driver failed to fully stop at stop signs 3 times in a trip of 3.5 km. 2) 11 out of 15 participants have lane drifting problems when they are making turns in the test. 3) Drivers took longer braking time when they approached a stop sign than a red light.},

year={2016}, 
volume={},

pages={1-8}, 
abstract={Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a novel platform that engages individuals in the act of collecting various types of spatial data. This method of data collection can significantly reduce cost and turnover time, and is particularly useful in environmental sensing, where traditional means fail to provide fine-grained field data. In this study, we introduce hyperlocal spatial crowdsourcing, where all workers who are located within the spatiotemporal vicinity of a task are eligible to perform the task, e.g., reporting the precipitation level at their area and time. In this setting, there is often a budget constraint, either for every time period or for the entire campaign, on the number of workers to activate to perform tasks. The challenge is thus to maximize the number of assigned tasks under the budget constraint, despite the dynamic arrivals of workers and tasks as well as their co-location relationship. We study two problem variants in this paper: budget is constrained for every timestamp, i.e. fixed, and budget is constrained for the entire campaign, i.e. dynamic. For each variant, we study the complexity of its offline version and then propose several heuristics for the online version which exploit the spatial and temporal knowledge acquired over time. Extensive experiments with real-world and synthetic datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solutions.},

abstract={Residential buildings account for a significant proportion of overall energy consumption across the world. Decentralized room level Air Conditioners (ACs) are a commonplace in developing countries such as India, contributing a major share (34% in India) of the total residential energy consumption. Option to independently control each AC presents a prime opportunity for an energy saving system. Thus, we propose PACMAN to non-intrusively (using only the temperature information) predict AC energy consumption prior to usage and estimate energy consumption post-usage. We discuss various possible applications and use cases of such feedback for the occupants. To empirically validate the performance of PACMAN, we conducted an in-situ study across seven homes in Delhi (India). We collected around 2200 hours of usage data from the different ACs, room types, and thermostat temperatures. We achieved an average accuracy of 85.3% and 83.7% with the best accuracy of 97.0% and 93.3% for the estimation and prediction of AC energy consumption respectively, across all homes. Towards the end, we discuss various outlier scenarios, opening up multiple directions for further research in this domain.},

abstract={Summary form only given. What will be the next computing paradigm as the ubiquitous computing wave crests: autonomobiles, robots, virtual reality, internet of things, intelligent agents? While pundits search for the next big thing among a dizzying array of shiny ideas, the truth is that pervasive technologies have reached critical mass that we no longer need to ask "what if" and we can shift our attention to "what when". One picture of that future is a recasting of how we think about designing digital experiences - rather than systems that react to user direction, we can design systems that respond dynamically to the users' attention, engagement and context: Responsive Media. The same machine learning technologies that have made speech and image recognition surprisingly accurate are also enhancing our devices' abilities to sense user activities, emotions and intentions and to deliver services and information proactively. Media experiences will be dramatically changed by the next generation of these technologies embedded into smartphones and VR goggles and robots and smart homes and autonomobiles so that they not only sense the audience's engagement in real time, but they can also predict disengagement and prevent it by dynamically shifting the content to appeal to an individual's preferences, emotion state and situation. More than just media experiences, imagine robots that can sense a child's frustration and actively assist in the homework, digital assistants that do not interrupt inappropriately, semi-autonomobiles that ensure the media is not disrupting the driver's attention demands, and more. Responsive media will be more like an engaging conversation among humans, rather than just passive consumption. What are the requirements for a conversational interaction? This talk will paint a picture and challenge the audience to identify the remaining technology barriers, architectures, business ecosystems, threats, and yes, the killer applications.

abstract={We present a method for recognizing a video that is playing on a TV screen by sampling the ambient light sensor of a user's smartphone. This improves situation awareness in pervasive systems because the phone can determine what the user is currently watching on TV. Our method works even if the phone has no direct line of sight to the TV screen, since ambient light reflected from walls is sufficient. Our evaluation shows that a 100% recognition ratio of the current TV channel is possible by sampling a sequence of 15 to 120 seconds length, depending on more or less favorable measuring conditions. In addition, we evaluated the recognition ratio when the user is watching video-on-demand, which exhibits a large set of possible videos. Recognizing professional YouTube videos resulted in a 92% recognition ratio; amateur videos were recognized correctly with 60% because these videos have fewer cuts. Our method focuses on detecting the time difference between video cuts because the light emitted by the screen changes instantly with most cuts and this is easily measurable with the ambient light sensor. Using the ambient light sensor instead of the camera greatly benefits energy consumption, bandwidth usage and raises less privacy concerns. Hence, it is feasible to run the measurement in the background for a longer time without draining the battery and without sending camera shots to a remote server for analysis.},

abstract={Acquiring local context information and sharing it among co-located devices is critical for emerging pervasive computing applications. The devices belonging to a group of co-located people may need to detect a shared activity (e.g., a meeting) to adapt their devices to support the activity. Today's devices are almost universally equipped with device-to-device communication that easily enables direct context sharing. While existing context sharing models tend not to consider devices' resource limitations or users' constraints, enabling devices to directly share context has significant benefits for efficiency, cost, and privacy. However, as we demonstrate quantitatively, when devices share context via device-to-device communication, it needs to be represented in a size-efficient way that does not sacrifice its expressiveness or accuracy. We present CHITCHAT, a suite of context representations that allows application developers to tune tradeoffs between the size of the representation, the flexibility of the application to update context information, the energy required to create and share context, and the quality of the information shared. We can substantially reduce the size of context representation (thereby reducing applications' overheads when they share their contexts with one another) with only a minimal reduction in the quality of shared contexts.},

However, face-to-face proximity is not the realm of solely person-to-person relationships, but it can be used as a proxy to study person-to-object relationships as well. We face the objects with which we interact on a daily basis, like a television, the kitchen appliances, a book, including more complex objects like a stage where a concert is taking place. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between the visitors of an art exhibition and its exhibits. We design, implement, and deploy a sensing infrastructure based on inexpensive mobile proximity sensors and a filtering pipeline that we use to measure face-to-face proximity between individuals and exhibits. Our pipeline produces an improvement in measurement accuracy of up to 64% relative to raw data. We use this data to mine the behavior of the visitors and show that group behavior can be recognized by means of data clustering and visualization.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a user authentication system, Headbanger, for smart head-worn devices, through monitoring the user's unique head-movement patterns in response to an external audio stimulus. Compared to today's solutions, which primarily rely on indirect authentication mechanisms via the user's smartphone, thus cumbersome and susceptible to adversary intrusions, the proposed head-movement based authentication provides an accurate, robust, light-weight and convenient solution. Through extensive experimental evaluation with 95 participants, we show that our mechanism can accurately authenticate users with an average true acceptance rate of 95.57% while keeping the average false acceptance rate of 4.43%. We also show that even simple head-movement patterns are robust against imitation attacks. Finally, we demonstrate our authentication algorithm is rather light-weight: the overall processing latency on Google Glass is around 1.9 seconds.},

abstract={Mobile computing is one of the largest untapped reservoirs in today's pervasive computing world as it has the potential to enable a variety of in-situ, real-time applications. Yet, this computing paradigm suffers when the available resources - such as device battery, CPU cycles, memory, I/O data rate - are limited. In this paper, the new paradigm of approximate computing is proposed to harness such potential and to enable real-time computation-intensive mobile applications in resource-limited and uncertain environments. A reduction in time and energy consumed by an application is obtained via approximate computing by decreasing the amount of computation needed by different tasks in an application; such improvement, however, comes with the potential loss in accuracy. Hence, a Mobile Distributed Computing framework, MobiDiC, is introduced to determine offline the `approximable' tasks in an application and a light-weight algorithm is devised to select the approximate version of the tasks in an application during run-time. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulation and testbed experiments by comparing approximate versus exact-computation performance.},

abstract={Mobile data offloading through WiFi is an essential requirement to reduce cellular network traffic. While extensive attempts have been made at mobile data offloading, previous studies have rarely addressed practical issues, such as dealing with diverse user contexts. In this paper, we propose a personalized data offloading scheme to provide maximum throughput within the cellular budget in daily life. We propose an adaptive policy that considers a user's mobility patterns, cellular budget, and network usage for applications. The proposed system employs an adaptive model to predict the throughput of WiFi APs and the network usage of smartphones. Among the three types of predictor model (i.e., spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal), the system automatically chooses the optimal model for each mobile user without user intervention. The experimental results from 10 mobile users show that the proposed system provides 29% higher throughput than previous systems and minimizes extra data charges.},

This paper investigates an application of mobile crowd sensing to detect and analyze the riding quality of public transport vehicles. The lightweight system leverages sensors equipped on participants' smartphones to collect surrounding information. By analyzing the uploaded data at a server, we are able to estimate both aggressive driving behaviors and environment contexts. Series of data processing methods are exploited to overcome the affection of body movement and road condition, and crowd sourcing is applied to improve the robustness of the results. We have tested this system in 3 different transportation in 3 cities.

abstract={Mobile participatory sensing systems allow people with mobile devices to collect, interpret, and share data from their respective environments. One of the main obstacles for long-term participation in such systems is the users' privacy concerns. Due to the nature of these systems, users have to agree to provide some personalized information. Typically, however, people are reluctant to share any information, as it may be sensitive. This is especially the case if the content of the data in question is not completely transparent. In order to increase users' willingness to participate in such systems, we should help users identify which data they can share without violating their personal privacy policies. However, the perception of how sensitive a piece of information is may differ from user to user. In this paper, we propose the human-centric privacy measurement method PriMe, which quantifies privacy risks based on user preferences towards data sharing in participatory sensing systems. Further, we implemented and deployed PriMe in the real world as a user study for evaluation. The study shows that PriMe provides accurate ratings that fit users' individual perceptions of privacy, and is accepted by users as a trustworthy tool.},

year={2016}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={1-9}, 
abstract={Chronic diseases are major causes of deaths in Australia and throughout the world. This necessitates the need for a self-care, preventive, predictive and protective assisted living system where a patient can be monitored continuously using wearable and wireless sensors. In real-time home monitoring system, various biological signals of a patient are obtained continuously using a mobile device (smart phone or tablet) and sent to the cloud to discover patient-specific abnormalities. The objective of this work is to develop a probabilistic model that identifies the future clinical abnormalities of a patient using recent and past values of multiple vital signs (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate). Chronic patients living alone in home die of various diseases for the lack of an efficient automated system having prior prediction ability in the irregularities of vital signs. In this paper, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is adopted to predict different clinical onsets using the temporal behaviours of six biosignals. The HMM models are trained and evaluated using continuous monitoring data of more than 1000 patients collected from the MIMIC-II database of MIT physiobank archive. The best models are selected using expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm and used in personalized remote monitoring system to forecast the most probable forthcoming clinical states of a continuously monitored patient. The scalable power of cloud computing is utilized for fast learning of various clinical events from large samples. The results obtained from the innovative home-based monitoring application show a new approach of detecting clinical anomalies using multi-parameter trends.},

abstract={We present a wearable textile sensor system for monitoring muscle activity, leveraging surface pressure changes between the skin and an elastic sport support band. The sensor is based on an 8×16 element fabric resistive pressure sensing matrix of 1cm spatial resolution, which can be read out with 50fps refresh rate. We evaluate the system by monitoring leg muscles during leg workouts in a gym out of the lab. The sensor covers the lower part of quadriceps of the user. The shape and movement of the two major muscles (vastus lateralis and medialis) are visible from the data during various exercises. The system registers the activity of the user for every second, including which machine he/she is using, walking, relaxing and adjusting the machines; it also counts the repetitions from each set and evaluate the force consistency which is related to the workout quality. 6 people participated in the experiment of overall 24 leg workout sessions. Each session includes cross-trainer warm-up and cool-down, 3 different leg machines, 4 sets on each machine. Plus relaxing, adjusting machines, and walking, we perform activity recognition and quality evaluation through 2-dimensional mapping and the time sequence of the average force. We have reached 81.7% average recognition accuracy on a 2s sliding window basis, 93.3% on an event basis, and 85.6% spotting F1-score. We further demonstrate how to evaluate the workout quality through counting, force pattern variation and consistency.},

We present a new real world data set that has been collected from 15 participants for 8 common activities were they carried 7 wearable devices in different positions. Further, we introduce a device localization method that uses random forest classifiers to predict the device position based on acceleration data. We perform the most complete experiment in on-body device location that includes all relevant device positions for the recognition of a variety of different activities. We show that the method outperforms other approaches achieving an F-Measure of 89% across different positions. We also show that the detection of the device position consistently improves the result of activity recognition for common activities.},

abstract={Pervasive and mobile computing technologies can make our everyday living environments and our cities "smart", i.e., capable of reaching awareness of physical and social processes and of dynamically affecting them in a purposeful way. In general, living in a smart environment and being made part of its activities somehow make us - as individuals - smarter as well, by increasing our perceptory and social capabilities. However, a potential risk could be to start delegating too much to the environment itself, losing in critical attention, abandoning individual decision making for relying on collective computational governance of our activity, and in the end also losing awareness of environmental and social processes. The panel intends to discuss the above issues with the help of relevant researchers in the area of pervasive computing, smart environments, collective intelligence.},

abstract={Activity recognition in smart environment has been investigated rigorously in recent years. Researchers are enhancing the underlying activity discovery and recognition process by adding various dimensions and functionalities. But one significant barrier still persists which is collecting the ground truth information. Ground truth is very important to initialize a supervised learning of activities. Due to a large variety in number of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), acknowledging them in a supervised way is a non-trivial research problem. Most of the previous researches have referenced a subset of ADLs and to initialize their model, they acquire a vast amount of informative labeled training data. On the other hand to collect ground truth and differentiate ADLs, human intervention is indispensable. As a result it takes an immense effort and raises privacy concerns to collect a reasonable amount of labeled data. In this paper, we propose to use active learning to alleviate the labeling effort and ground truth data collection in activity recognition pipeline. We investigate and analyze different active learning strategies to scale activity recognition and propose a dynamic k-means clustering based active learning approach. Experimental results on real data traces from a retirement community-(IRB #HP-00064387) help validate the early promise of our approach.},

abstract={In this paper we demonstrate a novel approach to the use of spatio-temporally aggregated cell phone data to learn features of urban ecology (i.e., spatial distributions of distinct social and economic entities and their associated activities). Specifically, our technique involves four stages: (i) decomposing the aggregated cell phone activity within local areal units using spectral methods; (ii) learning spectral characteristics associated with ecological features using a training set; (iii) predicting local ecology composition for out-of-sample areas; and (iv) predicting activity time series for out-of-sample areas. The core of our approach is the projection of spectral features in cell phone activity series into an ecology-associated basis, allowing both identification of communication patterns arising from particular types of local activities and/or institutions and leveraging of those patterns for classification and activity prediction. We apply our methodology to aggregated communication and Internet traffic data from the cities of Milan and Trento to show the effectiveness of our method.},

The proposed IRIS framework uses standard locomotive and gestural micro-activities as building blocks to define novel composite features that help classify different facets of a shopper's interaction/experience with individual items, as well as attributes of the overall shopping episode or the store. Besides defining such novel features, IRIS builds a novel segmentation algorithm, which partitions the duration of an entire shopping episode into atomic item-level interactions, by using a combination of feature-based landmarking, change point detection and variable-order HMM-based sequence prediction. Experiments with 50 real-life grocery shopping episodes, collected from 25 shoppers, we show that IRIS can demarcate item-level interactions with an accuracy of approx. 91%, and subsequently characterize item-and-episode level shopper behavior with accuracies of over 90%.},
