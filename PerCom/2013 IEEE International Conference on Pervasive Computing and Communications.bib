abstract={The notion of Ubiquitous (or Pervasive) Computing was first eloquently described by Mark Weiser at Xerox PARC in the early 1990's. He proposed a vision in which the personal computing model would evolve from one person using one computer, to many (perhaps hundreds) of computers per person; and that computing would become wirelessly embedded in the world around us, tacitly supporting our work practice. Today, twenty years later, we find ourselves surrounded by smartphones, tablets, and digital televisions much like the components of his vision: Tabs, Pads and LiveBoards. This talk will look back on what was envisioned, compare it with the reality of todays mobile market, examining what was correctly predicted, what worked and what did not. And then, reviewing key market trends, we will look forward to consider the future opportunities for pervasive computing, and some of the challenges and important use cases that we now need to consider.},

abstract={Smartphone applications have millions of users. Their energy efficiency is very important. However, we investigated 174 Android applications and found 33 of them suffering serious energy inefficiency problems. Many of these problems are due to ineffective use of sensors and their data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to systematically diagnose energy inefficiency problems in Android applications. We derive an application execution model from Android specifications, and leverage it to realistically simulate an application's runtime behavior. Our approach can automatically analyze an application's sensory data utilization at different states, and report actionable information to help developers locate energy inefficiency problems and identify their root causes. We built a tool called GreenDroid on top of Java PathFinder and evaluated it using six popularly downloaded Android applications. GreenDroid analyzed these applications in a few minutes, and successfully located real energy inefficiency problems in them.},

abstract={Pervasive applications are designed to support users in their daily lives. In order to provide their services, these applications interact with the environment, i.e. their context. They either adapt themselves as a reaction to context changes, or adapt the context via actuators according to their needs. If multiple applications are executed in the same context, interferences are likely to occur. In this paper, we present COMITY-a framework for interference management in multi-platform pervasive systems. Based on contracts specifying an application's interaction with the context, the framework automatically detects interferences and resolves them through a coordinated application adaptation. We analyze the problem of interference resolution, discuss respective algorithms and extensively evaluate our prototype.},

title={Fast dynamic execution offloading for efficient mobile cloud computing}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={20-28}, 
abstract={In order to meet the increasing demand for high performance in smartphones, recent studies suggested mobile cloud computing techniques that aim to connect the phones to adjacent powerful cloud servers to throw their computational burden to the servers. These techniques often employ execution offloading schemes that migrate a process between machines during its execution. In execution offloading, code regions to be executed on the server are decided statically or dynamically based on the complex analysis on execution time and process state transfer time of every region. Expectedly, the transfer time is a deciding factor for the success of execution offloading. According to our analysis, it is dominated by the total size of heap objects transferred over the network. But previous work did not try hard to minimize this size. Thus in this paper, we introduce novel techniques based on compiler code analysis that effectively reduce the transferred data size by transferring only the essential heap objects. The experiments exhibit that the reduced size positively influences not only the transfer time itself but also the overall effectiveness of execution offloading, and ultimately, improves the performance of our mobile cloud computing significantly in terms of execution time and power consumption.},

title={Effective routine behavior pattern discovery from sparse mobile phone data via collaborative filtering}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={29-37}, 
abstract={Recognizing and classifying users' routine behavior patterns from sensor data has been a hot topic in pervasive computing. Its objective is to automatically discover recurrent routine patterns in a user's daily life by leveraging the multimodal data generated from wearable sensors such as mobile phones. This kind of knowledge can be utilized in many ways such as identifying similar users in terms of their behaviors, providing behavior contexts to enable advanced human-centered applications, etc. While numerous works have been done in this area, most of them rely on densely sampled mobile data collected from specially-programmed sensors that can ‚Äúfollow‚Äù people throughout the day. In this paper, we study how to achieve the same objective when the mobile data presented is much sparser, such as traditional mobile phone data where a user's location is reported only when he makes a call. Although a single user's mobile data is far from sufficient to reveal his characteristic behavior, we show that when exploiting a large number of users' mobile data in a principled collaborative way which facilitate similar users' data to complement each other, representative routine patterns can be revealed and each user can be characterized properly. Experiments on synthetic and real mobile phone data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, and also show our model's ability in predicting human activity using the patterns learned.},

pages={38-46}, 
abstract={We propose a hybrid approach for recognizing complex Activities of Daily Living that lie between the two extremes of intensive use of body-worn sensors and the use of infrastructural sensors. Our approach harnesses the power of infrastructural sensors (e.g., motion sensors) to provide additional `hidden' context (e.g., room-level location) of an individual and combines this context with smartphone-based sensing of micro-level postural/locomotive states. The major novelty is our focus on multi-inhabitant environments, where we show how spatiotemporal constraints can be used to significantly improve the accuracy and computational overhead of traditional coupled-HMM based approaches. Experimental results on a smart home dataset demonstrate that this approach improves the accuracy of complex ADL classification by over 30% compared to pure smartphone-based solutions.},

title={Extraction of latent patterns and contexts from social honest signals using hierarchical Dirichlet processes}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={47-55}, 
abstract={A fundamental task in pervasive computing is reliable acquisition of contexts from sensor data. This is crucial to the operation of smart pervasive systems and services so that they might behave efficiently and appropriately upon a given context. Simple forms of context can often be extracted directly from raw data. Equally important, or more, is the hidden context and pattern buried inside the data, which is more challenging to discover. Most of existing approaches borrow methods and techniques from machine learning, dominantly employ parametric unsupervised learning and clustering techniques. Being parametric, a severe drawback of these methods is the requirement to specify the number of latent patterns in advance. In this paper, we explore the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods, a recent data modelling framework in machine learning, to infer latent patterns from sensor data acquired in a pervasive setting. Under this formalism, nonparametric prior distributions are used for data generative process, and thus, they allow the number of latent patterns to be learned automatically and grow with the data - as more data comes in, the model complexity can grow to explain new and unseen patterns. In particular, we make use of the hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP) to infer atomic activities and interaction patterns from honest signals collected from sociometric badges. We show how data from these sensors can be represented and learned with HDP. We illustrate insights into atomic patterns learned by the model and use them to achieve high-performance clustering. We also demonstrate the framework on the popular Reality Mining dataset, illustrating the ability of the model to automatically infer typical social groups in this dataset. Finally, our framework is generic and applicable to a much wider range of problems in pervasive computing where one needs to infer high-level, latent patterns and contexts from sensor data.},

title={Time-lag method for detecting following and leadership behavior of pedestrians from mobile sensing data}, 
year={2013}, 
volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={56-64}, 
abstract={The vast availability of mobile phones with built-in movement and location sensors enable the collection of detailed information about human movement even indoors. As mobility is a key element of many processes and activities, an interesting class of information to extract is movement patterns that quantify how humans move, interact and group. In this paper we propose methods for detecting two common pedestrian movement patterns, namely individual following relations and group leadership. The proposed methods for identifying following patterns employ machine learning on features derived using similarity analysis on time lagged sequences of WiFi measurements containing either raw signal strength values or derived locations. To detect leadership we combine the individual following relations into directed graphs and detect leadership within groups by graph link analysis. Methods for detecting these movement patterns open up new possibilities in - amongst others - computational social science, reality mining, marketing research and location-based gaming. We provide evaluation results that show error rates down to 7%, improving over state of the art methods with up to eleven percentage points for following patterns and up to twenty percentage points for leadership patterns. Our method is, contrary to state of the art, also applicable in challenging indoor environments, e.g., multi-story buildings. This implies that even quite small samples allow us to detect information such as how events and campaigns in multistory shopping malls may trigger following in small groups, or which group members typically take the lead when triggered by e.g. commercials, or how rescue or police forces act during training exercises.},

In this talk we explore the role of pervasive computing and communications in buildings - where, in the US, we spend 90% of our time, over 70% of our electrical energy, and nearly 50% of our GHG emissions. We examine how pervasive monitoring serves to identify waste and opportunities for energy efficiency; how diverse sources of physical information can be homogenized to enable an innovative application ecosystem; and how a building operating system and services can provide a foundation for advanced control techniques that operate in concert with external factors, such as energy availability and weather, and for personalized environmental conditioning.

volume={},

pages={66-75}, 
abstract={As a key technology of home area networks in smart grids, fine-grained power usage monitoring may help conserve electricity. Several existing systems achieve this goal by exploiting appliances' power usage signatures identified in labor-intensive in situ training processes. Recent work shows that autonomous power usage monitoring can be achieved by supplementing a smart meter with distributed sensors that detect the working states of appliances. However, sensors must be carefully installed for each appliance, resulting in high installation cost. This paper presents Supero - the first ad hoc sensor system that can monitor appliance power usage without supervised training. By exploiting multisensor fusion and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, Supero can classify the appliance events of interest and autonomously associate measured power usage with the respective appliances. Our extensive evaluation in five real homes shows that Supero can estimate the energy consumption with errors less than 7.5%. Moreover, non-professional users can quickly deploy Supero with considerable flexibility.},

title={Providing privacy-aware incentives for mobile sensing},

volume={}, 
number={}, 
pages={76-84}, 
abstract={Mobile sensing exploits data contributed by mobile users (e.g., via their smart phones) to make sophisticated inferences about people and their surrounding and thus can be applied to environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring and healthcare. However, the large-scale deployment of mobile sensing applications is hindered by the lack of incentives for users to participate and the concerns on possible privacy leakage. Although incentive and privacy have been addressed separately in mobile sensing, it is still an open problem to address them simultaneously. In this paper, we propose two privacy-aware incentive schemes for mobile sensing to promote user participation. These schemes allow each mobile user to earn credits by contributing data without leaking which data it has contributed, and at the same time ensure that dishonest users cannot abuse the system to earn unlimited amount of credits. The first scheme considers scenarios where a trusted third party (TTP) is available. It relies on the TTP to protect user privacy, and thus has very low computation and storage cost at each mobile user. The second scheme removes the assumption of TTP and applies blind signature and commitment techniques to protect user privacy.},

pages={85-93}, 
abstract={Mobile phones play a pivotal role in supporting ubiquitous and unobtrusive sensing of human activities. However, maintaining a highly accurate record of a user's behavior throughout the day imposes significant energy demands on the phone's battery. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of METIS: an adaptive mobile sensing platform that efficiently supports social sensing applications. The platform implements a novel sensor task distribution scheme that dynamically decides whether to perform sensing on the phone or in the infrastructure, considering the energy consumption, accuracy, and mobility patterns of the user. By comparing the sensing distribution scheme with sensing performed solely on the phone or exclusively on the fixed remote sensors, we show, through benchmarks using real traces, that the opportunistic sensing distribution achieves over 60% and 40% energy savings, respectively. This is confirmed through a real world deployment in an office environment for over a month: we developed a social application over our frameworks, that is able to infer the collaborations and meetings of the users. In this setting the system preserves over 35% more battery life over pure phone sensing.},

pages={94-102}, 
abstract={Online collaboration tools such as Google+, Face-book or Dropbox have become an important and ubiquitous mediator of many human interactions. In the virtual world, they enable secure interaction by controlling access to shared resources. Yet relying on them to support synchronous direct interactions, such as face-to-face meetings, might be suboptimal as they require reliable online connectivity and even then often introduce delays. A much more efficient way of co-located resource sharing is the use of local communications, such as ad-hoc WiFi. Yet setting up the necessary encryption and authentication mechanisms is often cumbersome. In this paper, we present PIKE, a key exchange protocol that minimizes this configuration effort. PIKE piggybacks the exchange of keys on top of an existing service infrastructure. To support encryption or authentication without Internet connection, PIKE relies on triggers for upcoming personal interactions and exchanges keys before they take place. To evaluate PIKE, we present two example applications and we perform an experimental as well as an analytical analysis of its characteristics. The evaluation indicates that PIKE is broadly applicable, scales well enough to support larger events and provides a level of security that is (at least) comparable to the one provided by the underlying service.},

One important challenge in these settings is privacy preservation for participatory sensing data, such as user trajectories. This paper develops a participatory sensing system for Android smartphones and proposes an efficient approach for privacy preservation which enables users to disclose their trajectory information without compromising their privacy. Existing approaches for privacy-aware data sharing operate under the assumption that user data is maintained in a centralized database. In our work we assume that user data is generated and stored locally on the individual smartphone devices. Our technique is distributed and low cost. We present detailed experimental results to illustrate that our approach is practical, efficient and with low overhead.},

abstract={In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate RF-Beep - a high-accuracy, one-way sensing, energy efficient and light-weight ranging scheme for smart devices. RF-Beep is based on the well known Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) scheme that utilizes the different propagation speeds of both the acoustic and the radio-frequency (RF) signals. Unlike the previous works, RF-Beep utilizes both the audio interface (i.e., microphone, speaker and sound driver) and the RF interface (i.e., WiFi) at the kernel-level of commercial-off-the-shelf smart devices. Implementing the scheme at lower levels enables us to understand and address the challenges related to the timing uncertainties in transmitting and receiving the acoustic signal. Moreover, RF-Beep does not require any special hardware or infrastructure support. In this paper, we describe the complete implementation of RF-Beep at the kernel space of Linux OS. We evaluate RF-Beep under different indoor and outdoor real scenarios. Results show that the error in the estimated range is less than 50cm for more than 93% of the time.},

abstract={802.11-based wireless LANs (WLANs) have become an important communication infrastructure for today's pervasive computing applications. Nevertheless, WLAN users often experience various performance issues such as highly variable signal quality. To diagnose such transient service degradations and plan for future network upgrades, it is essential to closely monitor the performance of a WLAN and collect user statistics. This paper proposes a new WLAN performance monitoring approach motivated by the fact that many low-power wireless technologies such as ZigBee and Bluetooth co-exist with WLAN in the same open radio spectrum and are capable of sensing Received Signal Strength (RSS) of 802.11 transmissions. We have developed a ZigBee-based WLAN monitoring system called WizNet. Powered by batteries, ZigBee sensors of WizNet can be deployed in large quantities to monitor the spatial performance of a WLAN in long periods of time. By adopting digital signal processing techniques, WizNet automatically identifies 802.11 signals from ZigBee RSS measurements and associates them with wireless access points. To ensure the monitoring fidelity, WizNet accounts for the significant differences in ZigBee and WLAN radios, such as bandwidth and susceptibility to multipath and frequency-selective fading. A simple yet accurate linear estimator derived from a signal propagation model is used to infer the access points' signal to noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, WizNet can measure the congestion level of the channel and detect rogue APs. WizNet can also collect WLAN client statistics and classify device models based on RSS signatures of 802.11 access point scans. We have implemented WizNet in TinyOS 2.x and extensively evaluated its performance on a wireless testbed. Our results over a period of 140 hours show that WizNet can accurately capture the spatial and temporal performance variability of a large-scale production WLAN.},

abstract={One of the main benefits of mobile participatory sensing becoming a reality is the increased knowledge it will provide about the real world while relying on a large number of mobile devices. Those devices can host different types of sensors incorporated in every aspect of our lives. However, given the increasing number of capable mobile devices, any participatory sensing approach should be, first and foremost, scalable. To address this challenge, we present an approach to decrease the participation of (sensing) devices in a manner that does not compromise the accuracy of the real-world information while increasing the efficiency of the overall system. To reduce the number of the devices involved, we present a probabilistic registration approach, based on a realistic human mobility model, that allows devices to decide whether or not to register their sensing services depending on the probability of other, equivalent devices being present at the locations of their expected path. We present the design and implementation of a registration middleware based on our techniques, using which mobile devices can base their registration decision. Through experiments performed on real and simulated datasets, we show that our approach scales, while not sacrificing significant amounts of sensing coverage.},

pages={141-150}, 
abstract={We present a framework for sensor actuation and control in sentient spaces, in which sensors are used to observe a physical phenomena. We focus on sentient spaces that enable pervasive computing applications, such as smart video surveillance and situational awareness in instrumented office environments. Our framework utilizes the spatio-temporal statistical properties of an observed phenomena, with the goal of maximizing an application-specified reward. Specifically, we define an observation of a phenomena by assigning it a discrete value (state) and we model its semantics as the transition between these values (states). This semantic model is used to predict the future states in which the phenomena is likely to be at, based on partially-observed past states. To accomplish real-time agility, we designed an approximate, adaptive-grid solution for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) that yields practically good results, and in some cases, guarantees on the quality of the approximation. We use our framework to control and actuate a large-scale camera network so as to maximize the number and type of captured events. To enable real-time control, we implement an action schedule using a table lookup and make use of a factored probability model to capture state semantics. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of actuating a large-scale sensor network based on a real-time POMDP formulation.},

abstract={The increasing use of mobile communications has raised many issues of decision support and resource allocation. A crucial problem is how to solve queries of Reverse Nearest Neighbor (RNN). An RNN query returns all objects that consider the query object as their nearest neighbor. Existing methods mostly rely on a centralized base station. However, mobile P2P systems offer many benefits, including self-organization, fault-tolerance and load-balancing. In this study, we propose two P2P algorithms focusing on bichromatic RNN queries, in which mobile query objects and static objects of interest are of two different categories, based on a boundary polygon around the mobile query object. The Exhaustive Search Algorithm makes use of all information from the peers to aim at high accuracy rate while the Optimized Search Algorithm reduces the number of queried peers. The algorithms are evaluated in MiXiM simulation framework with a real dataset. The results show the practical feasibility of the P2P approach in solving bichromatic RNN queries for mobile networks.},

pages={172-178}, 
abstract={Indoor localization has attracted much attention recently due to its potential for realizing indoor location-aware application services. This paper considers a time-critical scenario with a team of soldiers or first responders conducting emergency mission operations in a large building in which infrastructure-based localization is not feasible (e.g., due to management/installation costs, power outage, terrorist attacks). To this end, we design and implement a collaborative indoor positioning scheme (CLIPS) that requires no preexisting indoor infrastructure. We assume that each user has a received signal strength map for the area in reference. This is used by the application to compare and select a set of feasible positions, when the device receives actual signal strength values at run time. Then, dead reckoning is performed to remove invalid candidate coordinates eventually leaving only the correct one which can be shared amongst the team. Our evaluation results from an Android-based testbed show that CLIPS converges to an accurate set of coordinates much faster than existing noncollaborative schemes (more than 50% improvement under the considered scenarios).},

abstract={Community detection is an important issue due to its wide use in designing network protocols such as data forwarding in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) and worm containment in Online Social Networks (OSN). However, most of the existing community detection algorithms focus on binary networks. Since most networks are weighted such as social networks, DTN or OSN, in this paper, we address the problems of community detection in weighted networks and exploit community for data forwarding in DTN and worm containment in OSN. We propose a novel community detection algorithm, and then introduce two metrics called intra-centrality and inter-centrality, to characterize nodes in communities. Based on these metrics, we propose an efficient data forwarding algorithm for DTN and an efficient worm containment strategy for OSN. Extensive trace-driven simulation results show that the data forwarding algorithm and the worm containment strategy significantly outperform existing works.},

abstract={The proliferation of modern smartphones has given rise to Public Sensing, a new paradigm for data acquisition systems utilizing smartphones of mobile participants. In this paper, we present DrOPS, a system for improving the efficiency of data acquisition in Public Sensing systems. DrOPS utilizes a model-driven approach, where the number of required readings from mobile smartphones is reduced by inferring readings from the model. Furthermore, the model can be used to infer readings for positions where no sensor is available. The model is directly constructed from the observed phenomenon in an online fashion. Using such models together with a client-specified quality bound, we can significantly reduce the effort for data acquisition while still reporting data of required quality to the client. To this effect, we develop a set of online learning and control algorithms to create and validate the model of the observed phenomenon and present a sensing task execution system utilizing our algorithms in this paper. Our evaluations show that we obtain models in a matter of just hours or even minutes. Using the model-driven approach for optimizing the data acquisition, we can save up to 80% of energy for communication and provide inferred temperature readings for uncovered positions matching an error-bound of 1¬∞C up to 100 % of the time.},

abstract={Social activities have great impact for human beings in psychological health and social relationship. The recognition of social activities can unobtrusively recognize and record users' daily social activities, enabling users to better manage their life. Existing work of social activity recognition focus on recognizing a limited set of social activities and are mainly based on the patterns of individual user such as location pattern, vocal pattern, or others. However, social activities inherently exhibit the patterns with respect to multiple users rather individual user. In this paper, we introduce the concept of social circle, to extract social patterns associated with multiple users in a generic set of social activities. A social circle refers to a set of users frequently gathering to conduct certain social activities. Based on social circle, we design a system called CircleSense that supports accurate recognition of a generic set of social activities. We validate the effectiveness of CircleSense through the real trace collected by 10 volunteers. The result shows that CircleSense outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy of social activity recognition.},

Idetic targets highlevel synthesis designs and automatically locates and embeds the checkpoints at the register-transfer level. We define an objective function that aims to find the checkpoints which incur minimum overhead and minimize recomputation energy cost. We develop and exploit a dynamic programming technique to solve the optimization problem. For real time operation, Idetic adaptively adjusts the checkpointing rate based on the available energy level in the system. Idetic is deployed and evaluated on cryptographic benchmark circuits. The test platform harvests RF power through an RFID-reader and stores the energy in a 3.3ŒºF capacitor. For storage of checkpointed data, we evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various non-volatile memories including NAND Flash, PCM, and STTM. Extensive evaluations show that Idetic reliably enables execution of long computations under different source power patterns with low overhead. Our benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the area and energy overheads corresponding to the checkpoints are less than 5% and 11% respectively.},

abstract={Taxi GPS traces provide us with rich information about the human mobility pattern in modern cities. Instead of designing the bus route based on inaccurate human survey regarding people's mobility pattern, we intend to address the night-bus route planning issue by leveraging taxi GPS traces. In this paper, we propose a two-phase approach based on the crowd-sourced GPS data for night-bus route planning. In the first phase, we develop a process to cluster ‚Äúhot‚Äù areas with dense passenger pick-up/drop-off, and then propose effective methods to split big ‚Äúhot‚Äù areas into clusters and identify a location in each cluster as a candidate bus stop. In the second phase, given the bus route origin, destination, candidate bus stops as well as bus operation time constraints, we derive several effective rules to build bus routing graph and prune the invalid stops and edges iteratively. We further develop two heuristic algorithms to automatically generate candidate bus routes, and finally we select the best route which expects the maximum number of passengers under the given conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive empirical studies are performed on a real-world taxi GPS data set which contains more than 1.57 million passenger delivery trips, generated by 7,600 taxis for a month in Hangzhou, China.},
