As a case study, we have developed Enhanced TCG that replaces real components of the trading card game in the real space with fictional components. It also integrates the real and fictional space using transmedia storytelling. In Enhanced TCG, a player sees the enhanced space using a head mounted display. We found that achieving immersion is a key factor to make our approach successful. The transformation from the real components to fictional components changes the meaning of the real space to more emotionally engage a player beyond the real space. This idea offers a lot of new promising opportunities like enhancing gamification by incorporating fictionality through Ubicomp technologies.},

Traditionally done with paper-and-pencil or web-based questionnaires, these data collection efforts are essential for transport modelling tools, which are often used to support the decision making process of transportation systems. The limitations of this traditional approach are well-known: under-reporting of trips; inaccurate time and location information; high cost per survey; lack of detailed route information. FMS is a fully automated survey system based on 3 components: logger (smartphone or dedicated device); backend system with real-time data analysis; activity diary web interface. It has been tested in several contexts, including a survey with the Singapore Land Transport Authority (LTA) involving 1500+ participants, each one logging and validating up to two weeks of data. We see FMS as a quantifying self tool with particular focus on activity and travel behavior. This paper presents insights and lessons learned from FMS field surveys, related to battery performance, interface design, and data quality, together with proposals to tackle some of its key challenges.},

We further select a few frequently appearing keypoints in each co-scene as "useful keypoints" (UKPs). In the online phase, when a query is issued, only UKPs from the nearest co-scene are selected, and subsequently we infer extrinsic camera parameters with multiple view geometry (MVG) technique.

In many cases, however, those data are not easily accessible from a computer program due to the lack of APIs to fetch them. In this paper, to cope with this problem, we propose an architecture for discovering, excavating, and streaming the entombed web contents (EWC). This architecture, called Sensorizer, leverages crowd sourcing for accurate EWC discovery, periodic web scraping with a headless browser for excavation from dynamic web pages, and a standardized communication protocol (XMPP) for data streaming to wide variety of applications.},

Empirical results obtained contain both good cases such as trains being estimated from CDRs and train objects corresponding to the train specified in GPS logs and bad cases such as the estimated train not corresponding to the actual train on which the passenger is riding. Therefore, analysis of each case is also carried out.

In the current state of the art, there is no technology that can record climbing routes and statistics about a climber's exercises. Taking photographs of routes is the state of art method of sharing descriptions of climbing routes with other climbing enthusiasts. We propose to automatically track climbing routes using wearable devices placed on the hands and feet of a climber. Each wearable device has an IMU sensor and a barometer on it. In addition, the devices on the hands have EMG sensors on them. The combination of these sensors can detect when a person makes contact with a hold, and the relative position of the hold contacted with respect to the current hold, and the type of hold. A map of the route, including annotations of the hand hold and foot holds used by the climber, can be inferred by performing dead reckoning based navigation for each of the devices.},

We propose that this approach can help the field of Participatory Design recognise that researchers and research teams constructively inform their practice through the attitudes they bring to what is necessarily a relational situation. The PCA will be of interest to researchers working with mental health and wellbeing communities in particular, but may also be valuable in offering a framework for Participatory Design as a broad field of practice.

Therefore, we propose an interactive interface allowing the drivers to make a driving plan on an expressway with traffic predictions, and thus change their driving behavior. By visualizing traffic predictions using a diagram with two time axes, drivers can look at multiple futures interactively. Thus, they can obtain enough information to avoid traffic congestion. We compared our interface with conventional traffic congestion presentations, and also investigated its feasibility in a real environment by distributing our interface as an Android application. Our results showed that drivers were able to make a driving plan more efficiently using our interface than with conventional methods, and then follow their planned route on an expressway in a real environment.},

 abstract = {Researchers have started recruiting users to record activity data with ground truth annotations in real-word settings. These annotations are considered "ground truth" because users who collected activity data probably know what happened during the activity. However, while ground truth annotations are generally believed to be truthful representations of recorded activities, other qualities of activity recordings such as temporal precision are also of researchers' interest. To assess and compare the qualities of annotated recordings collected among different approaches, it is necessary to have another way to capture a ground truth of users' activities. In this paper, we demonstrate how we used wearable cameras and phone logs to assess the quality of users' recorded transportation activity data. We focus on how we collected photos and logs and generated a ground truth of transportation activity data, and we present challenges we encountered in the generation process.},

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is suitable for the IoT and supports multicast communication with things. However, multicast may lead to a traffic overload when the corresponding multiple responses travel through a CoAP-proxy concurrently. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to constructing a CoAP-proxy, which supports the efficient multicasting and grouping things based on the semantic description of a request. In addition, the proposed proxy merges multiple responses into an aggregated one, which is returned to a client. To demonstrate the feasibility, we implemented a prototype of the proposed CoAP-proxy and evaluated the performance of our approach in terms of the response time and network traffic.},

Through new open standards and novel protocols this loose collection of devices increasingly evolves into a superorganism of wearables and environmental devices. All these devices share a single ubiquitous sensor type: the RF-interface. Ubiquitously available signals from e.g. FM-radio, WiFi or UMTS can be exploited as sensor for presence, location, crowd-size, activity or gestures [4, 1, 2]. On-site training of these systems will soon be replaced by offline-raytracing techniques [3] and recognition accuracies will further increase with the Channel State Information (CSI) on recent OFDM receivers. In contrast to RSSI, CSI features channel response information as a PHY layer power feature, revealing amplitudes and phases of each subcarrier (cf. Figure 2). Exemplary, enabled by this superorganism of wireless devices, we envision the advance of sentiment sensing, smart city architectures as well as autonomous intelligent spaces.},

Thus, mobile apps can easily use remote services to execute the app logic, which typically integrates services in a distributed mobile environment. However, as the number of services increase, and the user's context changes, it is challenging for mobile apps to discover relevant device services due to incompatible protocols and unknown devices. A smart agent is needed to guide service composition in mobile apps with respect to the user's changing context, so that mobile apps can seamlessly integrate services from different networks and execute complex tasks. To this end, I present a novel approach for context-aware service discovery based on semi-lazy bandit algorithms, and, present a functioning prototype as a microservice, which shows encouraging first results.},

However, they all assume a static budget for a task, the dynamics of tasks in terms of sensing contexts as well as user knowledge to the target area is not considered. This may result in uncompleted or overpaid tasks. In addition, existing studies mainly motivate user participation, whereas the quality of data is paid little attention. To address these issues, we propose a novel MCS incentive mechanism called TaskMe. An LBSN-powered reference model for dynamic budgeting is proposed, and a combination of reputation and multi-payment-enhanced reverse auction scheme is used to improve data quality.

However, since those users generally undertake multiple tasks simultaneously and perform them concurrently, the verification of a work increases in complexity. In this study, we propose a method to define a task and to verify multiple tasks that are performed concurrently. We first consider the definition of a single task by regarding it as an ordinal state machine and categorize events into three categories. Then, we propose a verification method for those concurrent tasks by assigning priorities on the transition categories.

 abstract = {Activity recognition (AR) has become an essential component of many applications present in our everyday lives such as life-logging, fitness tracking, health and wellbeing monitoring. To build an AR system, one needs to first identify a set of activities of interest and collect labeled training data for these activities. However, activities of interest are not often known in advance. For example, a system designed to monitor a user's life style for potential diabetes risk needs to recognize all physical activities a user performs in her daily life. Given the large number of possible human activities, many of them cannot be foreseen during the model training time. In this work, we study the problem of discovering these unknown activities after the system is deployed by asking users to provide additional labels. Our goal is to discover all the unknown activities (i.e., obtain at least one label per class) while minimizing the amount of labels a user needs to provide. We propose SuperAD (Supervised Activity Discovery) approach, which combines active learning, semi-supervised learning and generative modeling to discover new unknown activities. We show that the proposed approach is especially effective when discovering activities with imbalance class distribution.},

 abstract = {Activity inference is a key to the development of various ubiquitous computing applications. Here, we observe that users perform several actions in their mobile phone: take photos, perform check-in, and access Wi-Fi networks. These behaviors generate spatial-temporal data that could be utilized to capture user activities. Hence, three features are extracted for activities inference: 1) geographical feature: indicating where user performs activities; 2) temporal feature: indicating when user performs activities; and 3) semantic feature: showing semantic concept of a place from location-based social networks. Here, we propose Spatial-Temporal Activity Inference Model (STAIM) to infer users' activities from aforementioned features. Experimental results show that STAIM is able to effectively infer users' activities, achieving 75% accuracy on average.},

Opportunities reach from using today's sensing, communication and display features of smartphones, wearable gadgets including smartwatches and glasses, up to instrumented environments with interactive walls. Pervasive Participation is an inherently interdisciplinary research endeavor requiring expertise from disciplines such as pervasive and mobile computing, human-computer interaction, social sciences as well as political sciences. We will select participants based on submitted position papers describing their research on advanced citizen e-participation. Together with them, we seek to discuss the requirements, opportunities, challenges and impact of such novel citizen e-participation concepts. This workshop is planned as a one-day workshop containing presentation sessions and an interactive brainstorming session and breakout activity for identifying relevant issues and upcoming research challenges.

 abstract = {The last decade has seen a considerable increase in the number of sensors we interact with on a daily basis. However, it is not always possible for a single sensing system to capture the complete story. While statically mounted infrastructure sensors typically capture the what, where, how much etc aspects of a detected event, e.g. (what appliance was used, how much energy did it consume), they do not always answer the who question. On the other hand, the advent of wearables has helped answer the what and who aspects - e.g. (who used the appliance). Fusing such sensor streams that observe the same event but different attributes of it, opens up many interesting applications. In this paper, we present a globally optimal data fusion algorithm for such pairs of systems, and show why traditional bipartite algorithms do not work. We evaluate our algorithm against two greedy baselines and show that our algorithm has lesser variance in the presence of time skew, false positives and false negatives.},

 abstract = {Eye tracking data has been widely used to analyze our reading behavior. Usually, experiments are carried out with head fixations or by analyzing eye tracking data in large areas such as paragraphs. But if we want to analyze the eye gaze line by line or word by word with a non invasive apparatus, we have to face the mislocation of the recorded eye gaze. The lack of accuracy involves a difficult analysis of the small eyes movements during reading. This paper proposes a method to match lines of gazes with corresponding text lines, using three different methods. We will show that the Dynamic Time Warping is a promising way to measure similarity between a line of gaze and a text line.},

Most existing studies seldom deal with newly extended surrounding contexts which results in degrading the recognition performance, in that the built classifier just basically recognizes limited classes learned in training phase. This paper proposes a fuzzy class incremental learning method based on OSELM, named FCI-ELM, for continuously recognizing extended classes of contexts. The encouraging results of our experiments show that FCI-ELM can automatically and continuously recognize newly discovered classes of contexts in the real-world, and the model can keep the same recognition ability by class incremental learning approach.},

The result shows that only 1.5% of the reports appear on both ThaiRSC and Twitter. This indicates that data from both sources could significantly complement each other and researchers using ThaiRSC source should be aware that single source of information may not be accurate in terms of completeness.},

The historical operations of various appliances are identified to determine whether the demands of user could be shifted. The electrical consumption is analyzed to estimate the parameters of appliances.

 abstract = {Evacuation drills are paramount for emergency preparedness as they train users for emergencies. The evaluation of these drills is critical as it provides insights about response times of building occupants. However, current evaluation of these drills is mostly manual, requiring a lot of human resources, and may still be imprecise with significant deviations from actual results. In this work, we emphasize the use of existing building infrastructure for an objective and automated evaluation of evacuation drills requiring lesser human resources compared to a manual evaluation. We propose the use of SNMP trap service on WiFi infrastructure for analysing occupant participation in evacuation drills. Traps are asynchronous messages sent by WiFi routers to server when an event (e.g. device authentication/de-authentication) occurs. Using the traps collected by our system during an informed drill, we study the evacuation patterns of building occupants. The results demonstrate that half the building users do not participate in the drill, and 34% of participating users evacuate the building using lifts. Our study further validates that most users in an informed fire drill violate the basic assumption -- that all users immediately evacuate the building in case of an emergency alarm. It also testifies the need for issuing prompt instructions to occupants to achieve successful evacuation.},

 abstract = {Emerging and future pervasive computing scenarios will soon feature a dramatic increase in the number of networked wearable devices: any computational mechanism involving humans (sensing, actuation, situation recognition, decision-making) will have the opportunity of involving large ensembles. What would be the proper programming model for such systems? We argue that it is nothing about current mainstream approaches, since they lack the suitable abstractions needed to smoothly address explosion of scale, resiliency and self-* properties, and heterogeneity of communication and computation infrastructure. We propose aggregate computing, a new approach for the development of large-scale, emerging pervasive computing systems. It considers as reference computing "machine" the overall "Superorganism of Wearables", abstracted to a mobile and densely interconnected continuum capable of manipulating physically-distributed computational structures as a whole. Independence from the details of the underlying network (size, density, topology, mobility) and support of resilience properties (adaptation, robustness, stabilisation) will no longer be a programming concern, but rather inherent features of the approach achieved by self-organisation "under-the-hood". In this talk, we give an overview of aggregate computing, and discuss its many facets and challenges: theoretical ground, production toolchain, libraries of reusable quality components, and run-time support.},

To propose effective ways of providing a more positive IoT user experience, this study examined the effects of identity extension (user identity being extended onto an IoT device vs. not being extended) and the type of framing (hedonic vs. utilitarian) of messages delivered via the device. Preliminary data from a between-subjects experiment (N = 22) revealed that identity extension induced greater attachment and satisfaction with regard to the device and resulted in the experience of greater feelings of social presence. In addition, the results indicated that the effect of identity extension on satisfaction and social presence was mediated by user attachment to the device.

In this study, we have executed system development, experiments by subjects, analysis of correlation between life-pattern and power consumptions and proposal of electrical power reduction for the purpose of reducing home power consumption. At present, we are working on analysis of correlation between a life pattern and electrical power consumption of the residents. We asked the residents for inputting their activities for around several minutes per day using a system that we have developed. We were able to collect approximately 11,745 activity inputs, approximately 7.14GB of sensor data, and power consumption data of 237,280 hours corresponding to about 4 months from 35 homes. Using the collected data, we carried out the multiple regression analysis taking an estimated time of activity and sustained period as explanation variables and average power consumption per day as an objective variable. As the result, it was known that there is correlation between life-pattern and power consumption. In this paper, we will show that it becomes possible to execute concrete analysis of relationship between power consumption and activities of residents by using the label data of resident's life pattern.},

 abstract = {Since the advent of smartphones equipped with sophisticated sensing hardware, human activity recognition research has moved from utilizing dedicated sensing devices to using commercial smartphones. This paper presents the design of an algorithm to recognize and estimate travel distance when riding an elevator and its corresponding implementation within an app for a smartphone running Apple's mobile operating system (iOS). The algorithm receives solely the signal of the smartphone's accelerometer, recognizes that it belongs to an elevator ride, and proceeds to calculate the distance traveled by the rider. The algorithm has been designed in a way that simplifies the necessary operations to calculate the travel distance with the objective of minimizing processing power, while keeping the corresponding estimations highly accurate. This is an initial attempt towards the building of a robust, but simple and fast, real-time human activity recognition service on a wearable platform.},

 abstract = {In the last year, Wearable Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality devices have seen a tremendous presence in the media. However, we have not seen a widespread adoption in industrial and professional scenarios yet. In this workshop, we want to assemble practitioners and researchers in the field to identify blockers of adoption and work towards overcoming them. Augmented Reality (AR) is a successful application area of Wearable Computing, especially for professional, industrial settings, in which mobility is an important factor. With the proliferation of mobile technology in the workplace, wearable computing research can offer a valuable contribution to the usability of mobile solutions, such as the use of context information to inform devices and services of the current task and user situation, relieve professionals of tedious and repetitive information entry tasks and increase worker safety in complex and hazardous environments. Wearable AR systems in general are widely utilized in various domains, including architecture, military, tourism, navigation, and entertainment. Such diverse usages impose several challenges on researchers from both areas of Augmented Reality and Wearable Computing, such as interaction, activity and context recognition, wearability, design, and modelling. We invite researchers and industrial developers from relevant disciplines to a one-day workshop held in conjunction with ISWC 2015 and UbiComp 2015 to present novel work and discuss the application of state-of-the-art Wearable Computing research and Augmented Reality systems. The workshop provides an opportunity for directed discussion to identify current issues, research topics, and solution approaches, which lead to the proposal of future research directions.},

My research goal is to advance a vision for "circadian computing" --- designing, developing and deploying novel technology that helps to maintain our innate biological rhythms. Towards that vision, I focus on developing technologies for detecting circadian disruptions and providing in-situ interventions. My approach involves passive and automated sensing of behavioral traits to model body clock patterns that can be used to support varying needs of users over time. One strand of my research focuses on developing tools that can adapt to our individual rhythms and provide more biologically attuned support in the areas of physical and cognitive performance, sleep, and wellbeing. The other aspect of my research focuses on mental health --- preventing relapse by identifying disruptions and providing circadian interventions for bipolar and schizophrenic patients.},

 abstract = {From the moment this gaze exists, I am already something other, in that I feel myself becoming an object for the gaze of others. But in this position, which is a reciprocal one, others also know that I am an object who knows himself to be seen. Jacques Lacan Why is there a tendency to associate visibility and transparency with truth, democracy and knowledge? Are there other forms of knowledge that come from the veil? How can we avoid the gaze, subvert it? Through the process of creating a device that draws awareness to the gaze, the Gaze Subversion Helmet, many fascinating questions arise. The form of the helmet lends it to be further objectified when the aperture becomes opaque. How does this heighten the experience and the awareness of the objectifying gaze? While this device does not address the digital realm of cyber-space, it focuses on the physical confrontations and a heightened awareness of the moment from which the gaze manifests. Its purpose is to react to this physical confrontation of real bodies and gazes. We are a species that requires privacy, yet that privacy has been deprived of us through concepts of total visibility and the ever present gaze. How can we design using a play of nuances of visibility, allowing for the gaze to manifest at particular moments and denying it at others? What can we learn from these nuances that we would not learn from a society of total visibility or total veiling? Drawing on architectural and design precedents, this helmet explores these nuances. The implications of the helmet go beyond the theoretical applications. These concepts can further be applied medically, specifically to those with difficulty with eye contact and personal confrontation.},

In order to assist with toy block assembly, our "StudI/O" system projects round markers on the studs of a target toy block to indicate the mounting position and direction of the block. When a user places a block in an appropriate location, the stud areas are illuminated exactly, without distortions. These markers are also useful when a user wants to disassemble his/her toy block work to scan the structure. This is an effective and practical system that uses only a projector. In addition, because the user manually adjusts the positions during the assembly and scanning task, no sensing devices to detect the position of the user and toy blocks are required.},

This study introduces the Mobile Photographic Stress Meter (MPSM), a new way to measure stress in which a user simply selects an image that best captures his or her stress level. Such a tool allows researchers to quickly measure stress in real time and in natural environments less onerous for the user. Our results show that MPSM is a valid measure of stress. Users find it easy and actually enjoyable to use. Our results also show that MPSM is strongly correlated with the Perceived Stress Scale, a validated multi-item stress scale. The correlation has an r-value of 0.5559 and a p-value of less than 0.001. We conclude that MPSM can be applied effectively in research experiments and advance the research on stress.},

In this regard, this position paper advocates for the importance of developing technologies that celebrate the subjective aspects of the body. As a theoretical ground, I find inspiration from Shusterman's concept of soma and his philosophical project of Somaesthetics, which acknowledges the body as mindful as well as a source of meaning-generation. Nowadays, technologies for self-exploration are mostly focused on supervising and shaping the objective body towards the interpretation of quantified outcomes. Even when the objective and subjective approaches can be complementary, I discuss about the current need for technology that takes into account the experiential and smart body that expands its semiotic world, providing new channels for self-expression and learning.},

Current work has generally focused on applying a range of traditional classification and semantic reasoning based techniques in order to recognise these activities. However, the ability to recognise unexpected actions while the activity is being conducted remains a challenge. In this paper, we present an approach that is able to recognise activities regardless of the order of tasks/actions used to perform the activity. The proposed recognition framework extends an existing activity recognition approach by deploying a frequent pattern mining technique to find patterns among different streams of captured sensor events in order to increase the adaptive learning of the proposed recognition approach.},

In this research, we aim to expand the concept to more realistic situation. We showed that the image of desktop icons affects human behaviors. If the small image like the icon image also affects human behaviors, the proposed system can simultaneously work with other applications.

 abstract = {Pedestrian ow analysis using Wi-Fi packet sensors can easily collect the movement trajectories of individuals, has a high-resolution sensing ability, and is well suited to indoor operations. Thus it is regarded as one of the promising sensing technologies for Smart Cities targeting a variety of applications such as disaster prevention, the planning of commercial and barrier-free facilities, and monitoring people with disabilities. However, because Wi-Fi packet sensors cannot detect devices that have disabled their Wi-Fi functionality or people with no Wi-Fi devices, they can only probabilistically estimate the number of people in a target area. We conducted a two-month field experiment in a shopping mall, and derived a coefficient for estimating the actual number of people in the area by comparing the number of recognized devices in the mall, as counted by Wi-Fi packet sensors, with data from motion detectors placed at all of the mall's entrances and exits. In the calculation process, we separated the collected data into weekdays and holidays by considering the visiting patterns, and calculated an estimation coefficient α for the actual number of people. This gives the least absolute error between the observed values given by the Wi-Fi packet sensors and hourly data of motion detectors over the course of a week. The accuracy of α is evaluated by comparing known data from the motion detectors with the estimated people numbers calculated from the Wi-Fi packet sensor data. As a result, we demonstrate that the maximum error in the number of people in the mall for each hour, accumulated over a day, is less than 7.9%.},

Therefore, region functions should be a critical factor to affect people's travel behaviors and it is possible to infer traffic patterns to be generated from newly planned region functions based on the associations between the data of two modalities so as to minimize traffic congestions at the urban planning stage.},

Several applications have been proven successful within this research context, for instance to promote healthier eating habits and the incorporation of physical activities in users' daily habits. Despite promising, the development of wearable solutions for healthcare still encompasses significant challenges; not only the devices must be comfortable and easy to use, but also their underlying strategies must be carefully designed to ensure users' acceptance, adoption and sustained engagement.

This burden is caused by a complex self-report that they need to provide or by additional wearables that need to be carried. Newest technology can solve this issue by assessing a variety of information automatically. We propose to use smartwatches in combination with smartphones to assess physiological and smartphone data from which the affective state of a user can be inferred. We present the principle idea of our app and how we intend on evaluating it. A review of state of the art approaches and available Android Wear smartwatches in terms of sensors is given.

Sampling can happen on a previously unimaginable scale, and across a diverse pool of participants. Therefore, mobile ESM is not limited to capturing users' manual responses, as the surrounding context can be automatically captured by mobile sensors. However, obtaining high quality data with ESM is challenging, as users may fail to respond honestly, or may even ignore the questionnaire prompts if they perceive the study as too burdensome. In this paper, we discuss the potential of using interruptibility prediction models to deliver mobile ESM questionnaires at opportune moments, and thus improve the effectiveness of a study. We examine context prediction and interruptibility inference, which are fundamental challenges that need we need to overcome in order to make mobile ESMs better aligned with a user's lifestyle, and consequently paint a truthful picture of a user's behaviour.},

This enormous amount of data often called big data becomes crucial for delivering new insights to decision makers. It contains behavioral information on different types of human activity influenced by many external factors such as geographic information and weather forecast. Early recognition and prediction of those human behaviors are of great importance in many societal applications like health-care, risk management and urban planning, etc. In this paper, we investigate relevant geographical areas based on their categories of human activities (i.e., working and shopping) in order to understand human-environmental relationships. We use spectral clustering approach followed by k-means algorithm based on TF/IDF cosine similarity metric. We evaluate the quality of the relevant area clusters with a use of silhouette coefficients which are estimated based on the similarities of the mobile communication activity temporal patterns. The area clusters are further used to explain typical or exceptional communication activities. We demonstrate our study using a real dataset containing 1 million Call Detailed Records. This type of analysis and application is important for discovering hidden relationships and unknown correlations.},

However, subsampling of sensor data can bias the inference drawn from trigger based ESM. We investigate whether continuous sensor data simplify the design of ESM. We use the typing pattern of users on smartphone as the context that can trigger response collection.

As technology is increasingly embedded in our everyday life, and wearables are becoming increasingly popular, we explore the concept of 'feeling' time. In this paper we present initial work into users' interactions with, and appropriation of, a simple wearable device that vibrates every five minutes. We discuss how lightweight interactions with such a device can increase our awareness of time in a peripheral way through the sense of touch, by presenting initial findings from two in-the-wild autoethnographies.},

A review is completed of supporting literature that shows the potential of multi-sensory stimulation and augmentation to increase the efficacy of mirror therapy. Building on this background, a glove is designed to allow the user to stimulate the fingertips of their affected hand by tapping the fingers of their unaffected hand, using Force Sensing Resistors to trigger Linear Resonance Actuators on the corresponding fingers. This paper outlines the design considerations and methods used to create the glove, and discusses the potential for further work in the pursuit of a clinical trial.},

 abstract = {Textiles are one of the most important materials developed and used extensively by man. Textiles have protected us from the hazardous environmental conditions and clothed us for modesty. One of the newest and rapidly growing area of textiles is electronic textiles where electronic interconnectivity is combined with 'classical' textiles. In the first generation, electronic devices were simply attached to garments or included in pockets. In the second generation, electronic functionality was achieved by incorporating conducting yarns into the textile structure. Integration of micro-semiconductor devices within the fibre of a yarn has an enormous potential in the creation of electronically functional yarns (EFY), and would provide the platform for the creation of a new generation of wearables (3rd generation).},

Many approaches including head-mounted displays, smart gloves, or in-situ projections have been suggested to provide cognitive support for the workers. Recently, research focused on improving the cognitive feedback by using activity recognition to make it context-aware. Thereby an assistance technology is able to detect work steps and provide additional feedback in case the worker makes mistakes. However, when designing feedback for a rather monotonous task, such as product assembly, it should be designed in a way it does neither over-challenge nor under-challenge the worker. In this paper, we sketch out requirements for providing cognitive assistance at the workplace that can adapt to the worker's needs in real-time. Further, we discuss challenges and provide design suggestions.},

Next, we use these headsets to draw a positive correlation between excessive blinking and deterioration in attention and performance to support past research, and demonstrate that time taken for the same work can increase up to 300% depending on the type of work, due to excessive blinking.

 abstract = {We demonstrate an interactive system called "MetamorphicWall", which senses its ambient conditions and makes massive graphic representation based on a simple small unit called 'cell' in real-time. Overall expression changes dramatically with just minute adjustment of parameters. Three modes of expression are demonstrated on the wall: Mesh, Foam and Dust. You would feel different 'responsive quality' in different mode through interactions such as touching or waving hands at the wall. This system has been built as part of our research aiming at creating interactive public walls, which we believe would be seen here and there as information ambience in the future ubiquitous age. A basic idea of our research is to build systems based on module-based computing, which is simple, scalable and most of all expressive.},

 abstract = {With wearable computing a new art form is evolving not only for artistic performances but now you can also interact with live digital performance content. Integrated with AR/VR (Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality) technologies, the future art performance will link with virtual characters. In this way the future artistic work may no longer be presented only on a stage, theater, or concert hall. In this paper we will present our idea on how to combine wearable sensors with art performances. Some technical problems need to be addressed. We surveyed the wearable hardware in the market and implemented the WISE (Wearable Item Service runtimE) platform. While wearing the sensors, skeleton (posture) information is delivered in real-time to WISE to render animations displayed on the screen or wearable glasses. This performance can be performed anywhere because it can be quickly deployed and supports improvisation. Even though there are hardware limitation due to non-customized hardware, we can still execute a live field performance to validate the idea and obtain feedback. We believe this will be a new art venue.},

On this tiny board, 8 sensors (acceleration, gyro, magnetic, light, UV, temperature, humidity, and pressure), flash memory, BLE, and battery are embedded in high density. Second interesting point is that it can run without a smartphone because it has a flash memory. The battery life in stand-alone mode is more than 12 hours. In addition to the hardware, we are now implementing a support software for iPhone/Android and Mac. Furthermore, 3D CAD data of various case designs will be open for users.

They can not only sketch on the pictures but can also change their viewpoint of the sketched environment, since the system captures 3D structure by using a depth sensor as well as RGB data. Trial usage of the system shows that our users can rapidly extract their target objects/space and extend their ideas by taking pictures and drawing/painting on them. This paper also discusses the feasibility of extension of the simple idea from personal usage to collaborative spatial designing by multiple designers, by enabling the merging of 3D sketch spaces.},

Equally, there is a growing understanding that the application of technology in support of Smart Cities helps grow the urban economy and deliver better services to citizens. However, often Smart City projects are top-down projects focused on improving city infrastructure using technology. We argue, and our experience over the last decade has shown, that often, citizen driven, or grass-roots based Smart City projects deliver better value and sustainable success. In this paper we report on our work to engage citizens and the technology community in smart city projects and highlight some lessons learnt from our experiences.

While home charging is the most common choice, workplace charging and its provision by employers has become an important option. For many, it is essential to cope with the limited range of most EVs. Home and work are the two places where vehicles are parked for long periods and so are prime candidates as charging locations. However, workplace charging is often a limited resource. This paper reports on an empirical study of workplace charging at a UK public sector employer. It explores the use of workplace charging (WPC) via spatiotemporal analysis of employees and visitors' charging events over a 3-month period. It provides insights into weekly patterns and daily mechanisms of using shared facilities in a WPC environment. We identify insights that are relevant in the design of workplace-charging infrastructure, identify the design needs, emerging requirements, and highlight potential areas for sociotechnical-interventions.},

In the ridership mode, the user can observe the varying number of riders (bus usage) in different areas of the city. The tool also allows the user to interact with the tool by not only selecting different modes of display (mobility and bus ridership), but also changing 2D-3D views, visualizing specific bus lines and stations, and viewing weather conditions. The visualization gives an overview of the dynamic urban flow. This also helps describe bus usage behavior, and it can be useful for urban planning and transport engineering to manage the flow in the city.},

 abstract = {Informal waste collectors can provide recycling services to developing cities, while cities seek better data collection and stewardship of their waste systems. Mobile applications can mediate this relationship, but must be accessible and adopted by informal workers. Based on past work with recycling cooperatives in Brazil, we built and tested Forager, a web and mobile platform for coops to track their own collection vehicles in real-time and improve coordination and transparency with their private partners and local government. Through observations, workshops, and interviews, we identified simple, error-tolerant, unobtrusive interfaces as ideal for informal work environments. Finally, we discuss how security, workload, and user expectations present unique opportunities and challenges for pervasive urban applications in developing contexts.},

I am motivated by the idea that a person's innate attributes and current contexts interact in ways that produce idiosyncratic behaviors that generic interventions may not suit. Using domain knowledge as a guide, my research develops lightweight profiling methods that leverage people's digital footprints in order to passively sense pertinent psychological, physiological, and behavioral characteristics -- and ultimately tailor personal informatics and intervention tools accordingly. I argue that such a theoretically-informed approach that is able to robustly mine, model, and accommodate personal variability will lead to technological solutions that better meet individual needs and produce more positive outcomes.},

The BioWear project explores the use of wearable technology to create deeper and more authentic human-to-human communications by using body metrics to sense and display emotions. BioWear kinetic accessories collect the wearer's physical data and use that information to manipulate the appearance, revealing the person's inner, genuine state. BioWear also explores the relationship between the objects we wear and the messages that we communicate with our clothing and our bodies. As an extension of our physical bodies, BioWear raises questions about the future and the boundaries of communication through fashion, design and technology.},

Delegates will reflect both on the user experience of being part of such methods, and on the design team experience, in line with recent calls for reflexivity in HCI. The workshop will enable delegates to situate their practice in the broader context of humanistic psychotherapy research, and implications for research methodologies and professional development will be discussed. Through a short series of talks, delegates will learn about attitudes and tools (specifically the Person Centred Approach and Interpersonal Process Recall) for reflection on team working and relational aspects of participatory design. The workshop will in turn contribute to the development of a person-centred framework for participatory and co-design research. This set of three talks reflects on the use of participatory design methods, especially in the context of design for mental health and wellbeing. In them we: introduce the Person-Centred Approach as a framework for conducting Participatory Design; outline the method of Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR); and present a heuristic case study of these approaches being developed by a multidisciplinary design research team with Mind, a UK mental health charity. The aims of the workshop are to: situate Participatory Design practice in the context of humanistic psychotherapy research, and discuss implications for design research methodologies; introduce phenomenological attitudes and tools for reflection on team working and relational aspects of Participatory Design; and contribute to the development of a person-centred framework for Participatory Design research.},

While the initial aim of such research was to identify brain regions where structural variation correlated with cognitive functions, the flurry of correlational findings suggest that MRI scans of the human brain can be used to make predictions about individuals. We have confirmed this idea by constructing highly accurate prediction models for a multitude of cognitive traits using a machine learning technique called elastic net. We are currently implementing those prediction models on a web-based service called Neuroprofile where anyone can upload their brain scan to view the predicted cognitive traits. This service will be provided to make the contents of MRI-based brain health check-ups much richer and more informative.},

To date we have concentrated on automatically detecting semantic concepts from within visual lifelogs yet identifying human activities from such lifelogged images or videos is still a major challenge if we are to use lifelogs to maximum benefit. In this paper, we propose an activity classification method from visual lifelogs based on Fisher kernels, which extract discriminative embeddings from Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of occurrences of semantic concepts.

When users share physical space or location with other people, a crucial but neglected modality is arguably the sense of ownership. If, how, and what someone can see, touch, hear, feel, and taste is normally strongly influenced by their perceptions as to who something belongs to. This is illustrated by presenting preliminary results from an ongoing design space review of wearable computing experimentation concerned with encouraging interpersonal interactions between co-located people. Drawing upon urbanism theory helps show how different variations of territorial blending can articulate tactics for increasing sociality through interactive garments. These insights are offered to aid understanding of the design space for developers directly concerned with influencing co-located interactions through interactive apparel, and to address wider challenges of designing socially acceptable ubiquitous interaction.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) has recently attracted attention of researchers. PDR refers to indoor positioning technology that uses the acceleration sensor and gyroscope from a smartphone for relative positioning. However, the positioning results are often degraded, owing to the accumulation of errors such as estimation errors and those incurred by the limited resolution of the sensors. One of the remedies for this problem is a map-matching technique that corrects the current position using pedestrian-space network data, where pathways are represented as a network of links. However, as a correction method, the map-matching technique is limited insofar as it ignores certain features to the users trajectory when automatically mapping the current position onto a link. The trajectory can be used to navigate a user walking along a pathway by providing directions, such as "your destination is on the opposite side of the pathway," depending on the current position of the user. In this study, we propose a method for correcting the crude PDR trajectory to a more likely trajectory by introducing pedestrian-space constraints and adding information about walls and barriers to the link information used by the conventional map-matching technique. We conducted an evaluation of the proposed method at the Umeda underground mall in Osaka, Japan. As a result, we demonstrate that the average positioning error was reduced by up to 60% with the proposed method. Moreover, we confirmed that the shape of actual trajectory remain in the corrected trajectory, and that the proposed method is practical for improving the accuracy of PDR positioning.},

Changes in this strength of the 24-hour cycle can illustrate changes or shifts in underlying human behavior. We have performed this analysis on several lifelog datasets of durations from several weeks to almost a decade, from recordings of training distances to sleep data. In this paper we use 24 hour accelerometer data to illustrate the technique, showing how changes in human behavior can be identified.},

Our challenge is to develop a real-time navigation system that enables movements of entire groups to be efficiently guided without causing congestion by making near-future predictions of people flow. Our approach tries to detect future congestion by using a spatio-temporal statistical method that predicts people flow. When future congestion is detected, our approach creates an optimal navigation plan based on "what-if" simulations, which accounts for the effect of total people flow change caused by navigation. We experimentally compare the spatio-temporal statistical method with the conventional matrix factorization based approach using a real data set. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation approach by computer simulation using artificial people-flow data.},

 abstract = {Personalized wearable ICT systems presented in fashionable and appealing lifestyle-designs have gained critical user acceptance, and comprise momentum to bring wearable computing to a socio-technical mass phenomenon within the next few years. Early indicators for this expected wearable systems 'tsunami' are the 'spring tide' of 7.3 billion mobile connected platforms (i.e. mobile subscribers) as of the end of 2014, 300 mio. shipped smart watches in 2014 with an expected annually growth of 35% till 2020, and a possible market for more than 200 million smart eyewear systems in 2015 [1]. Following the great success of the 1st Superorganism of Wearables Workshop at Ubicomp 2014 with roughly 50 participants from 15 different countries, we build on the immense interest of the research community in the proposed topic. The structuring of the workshop in slots initiated by a keynote presentation accompanied by technical paper presentations and position statements resulted in lively and vibrant discussions. Collected material for the dissemination of the Workshop ideas can be found at the Workshop Website (https://www.pervasive.jku.at/ubicomp14/) The 2nd instantiation of the workshop will reattach to last years agenda and ask the questions on the potentials and opportunities of turning these massively deployed wearable systems to a globe spanning superorganism of socially interactive personal digital assistants. While the individual wearables are of heterogeneous provenance and typically act autonomously, we can assume that they can (and will) self-organize into large scale cooperative collectives, with humans being mostly out-of-the-loop [2]. We may not assume a common objective or central controller, but rather volatile network topologies, co-dependence and internal competition, non-linear and non-continuous dynamics, and sub-ideal, failure prone operation. We could refer to these emerging massive collectives of wearables as a "superorganism" [3], since it exhibits properties of a living organism (like e.g. 'collective intelligence') on its own. In order to properly exploit such superorganisms, we need to develop a deeper scientific understanding of the foundational principles by which they operate.},

Our poster presents a queue analytics system, which collaboratively uses the mobile data from taxis and smartphones, to detect both passenger queues and taxi queues. In particular, the system firstly determines the existence of taxi queues by analyzing the taxi data, and then make a soft inference on passenger queues. Meanwhile, the passenger side adopts the smartphone-based crowd sensing strategy to detect the personal-scale queuing activities. Lastly, the system aggregates the detection results and validates passenger queues. The extensive empirical experiments demonstrate our system can accurately and effectively achieve the design objectives. Moreover, the system envisions a novel crowd sensing way to perform online analysis using data from heterogeneous sources.},

@inproceedings{Ferscha:2015:CAS:2800835.2809508,
 abstract = {Collective Adaptive System (CAS) as a broad term refers to todays observable indications of a deployment of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at a very large scale (e.g. 3.5*109 personal computers, 6.2*109 smart phones, 1.1*109 cars on planet). Taking such a massive ICT deployment, it is not just considered possible, but already a reality that these are programmed to operate cooperatively as very large scale collectives. As for example, smartphone apps have demonstrated globe-spanning cooperative sensing applications, liquid democracy applications, logistics and traffic management applications, energy management applications, etc. One essential aspect of such globe-spanning ICT collectives is that they often exhibit properties typical observed in complex systems, like (i) spontaneous, dynamic network configuration, with (ii) individual nodes acting in parallel, (iii) constantly acting and reacting to what the other agents are doing, and (iv) where the control tends to be highly dispersed and decentralized. If there is to be any coherent behavior observed on the level of the collective (macro-level), it (v) it usually arises from competition and cooperation among the individual elements (micro-level). The overall behavior of the collective (macro-behaviour) is the result of (vi) a huge number of decisions made every moment by many individual entities (micro-interactions), possibly leading to (vii) the emergence of unexpected phenomena. A critical challenge for CAS is to design and implement collectives able to operate in a more or less autonomous way, with little or no human interaction. In this endeavor, self-adaptation and self-management have emerged as two interrelated facets of CASs. Self-adaptive collectives in a top down strategy evaluate their own global behavior and change it when the evaluation indicates that they are not accomplishing what they were intended to do, or when better function or performance is possible. Here a challenge is to identify how to change the behaviors of the individuals so as to achieve the desired collective improvement. In self-managing collectives, individuals interact locally, typically according to a small set simple rules. Achieving a desirable collective behaviour is attempted with a bottom up strategy, in that local interaction policies are adopted so as to steer global behavior. Self-organisation is the process of enabling a system to change its organisation in case of environmental changes without explicit external command. We can distinguish between: weak self-organisation where from an internal point of view, there is re-organisation under an internal central control or planning; and strong-selforganisation (also referred to as "emergence"), where there is re-organisation with no explicit central control, either internal or external [1]. Building upon the mechanisms of self-adaptation and self-management, we may ask the questions on the potentials and opportunities of turning massively deployed systems to a globe spanning superorganism of socially interactive elements [2]. While the individual elements are of heterogeneous provenance and typically act autonomously, we can assume that they can (and will) self-configure into large scale cooperative collectives, either with or without human governance [3,4]. We may not assume a common objective or central control, but rather volatile network topologies, codependence and internal competition, non-linear and non-continuous dynamics, and sub-ideal, failure prone operation. The recent literature has referred to these emerging massive collectives as "superorganisms" [5], since they exhibit properties of a living organism (like e.g. 'collective intelligence') on its own. In order to properly exploit such superorganisms, we need to develop a deeper scientific understanding of the foundational principles by which they operate.},

 abstract = {Human activities analyses based on sensor data are gaining much importance. Of particular importance are those situations where man-machine interaction needs to be studied. The detection of risk induced while driving and customizing the insurance premium accordingly is an appropriate example. For such, the individuals are induced to utilize their personally owned smartphones in order to collect data and share them with insurance companies. The traditional approach counts the number of harsh events and infers the risk induced. However, such event-based inference is not necessarily a suitable approach for understanding each individual's propensity to indulge in high risk maneuvers. We propose an alternate method where a statistical route is adopted for quantifying risk propensity as well as a comparative analysis amongst a peer-group of drivers. A relatively moderate scale experimental test bed had been deployed by collecting driving related data (using their smartphones) from approximately 50 volunteers, fora duration of two months at a stretch. The experiment was unsupervised and the relative assessment is dependent on the quantity and quality of the collected data for each driver. In our model, the acceleration profiles displayed by each driver for every completed trip are observed to extract statistical features like 'Skewness squared' and 'Kurtosis'. It is observed that the kurtosis of the acceleration profiles stores major information about the driving styles. Subsequently, we have used statistical techniques to identify trends in data and used it to quantify the nature of the driving style. A comparative analysis within the peer-group (people with similar demographic features and similar work responsibilities) is done to judge individual propensities. It is envisaged that such application can be used to induce road safety through competitive spirit; additionally a large enterprise will find this tool useful to encourage employees to move towards a safe and fulfilling lifestyle. In this paper, we present the initial results of the above mentioned exercise using a smaller subset of the collected data.},

Borrowing from both theatrical and photographic lighting design, Halo has several different lighting compositions that make the wearer appear happy, sad, energetic, mysterious, etc. Using a smart phone application, the wearer can switch between these modes. She can also let the application adjust automatically depending on her activities.

Different from camera-based approaches, our solution can preserve user privacy, scaling better in terms of costs than existing solutions. Using the data collected from real environments, we examine different supervised learning algorithms and identify that Random Forest is the best model. Our solution has been deployed and tested in a Singapore shopping mall, showing that 95% of the overcrowded situations can be detected.},

 abstract = {The work described in this paper focuses on how to reveal culturally-related data to city tourists to help them in navigating both the physical space through which they are moving (the cityscape) and a conceptual space around points of interest which links them through shared stories of time, place, people and theme (the datascape). The research goal is to discover to what extent navigational strategies in a conceptual space should be reflected in a physical space, or vice versa. This paper describes preliminary analysis of results from two studies. These studies suggest that tourists have a strong preference for visiting places in order of 'closest next'. However, tourists also want to understand how places are conceptually related. Providing this type of information may assist tourists in their informal learning from a city visit.},

In order to prevent a person from becoming a metabolic syndrome, it is important to know own current actual abdominal circumference, and care by yourself. However, any wearable devices cannot measure abdominal circumference. In this paper, we propose and implement a belt-type wearable device, called "WaistonBelt", and a smartphone application that can keep monitoring an abdominal circumference forever. "WaistonBelt" can measure an abdominal circumference with ordinary action, and can visualize a transition of it. Through an experimental evaluation, we confirm that our system can measure an abdominal circumference with 0.66% error.},

 abstract = {We present MoA2, a context-aware smartphone app for the ambulatory assessment of mood, tiredness and stress level. In principle, it has two features: (1) mood assessment and (2) mood recognition. The mood assessment system combines benefits of state of the art approaches. The mood recognition is concluded by smartphone-based wearable sensing. In a formative study, we evaluated the usability and unobtrusiveness of our mood assessment. A median SUS score of 90 shows a high usability. Subjects reported an easy, fast and intuitive use. The mood recognition was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy. First, we analyzed which features are best for the recognition. Spatio-temporal attributes, i.e. daytime, day of week and location, correlate most with the monitored mood. Based on the identified attributes, we trained personalized classifiers using Naïve Bayes and applied ten-fold-cross validation. The average recognition accuracy was 0.76 which is comparable to related work.},

 abstract = {Hybrid indoor positioning researches, which aim improving the positioning accuracy by applying multiple positioning techniques, are the focus of many researchers in these days. However, the current approaches do not consider the positioning accuracy, and tend to combine the positioning techniques together without further caring about the accuracy of each technique. We propose a novel method named "cross-assistive approach" for improving the positioning accuracy by using PDR and Wi-Fi positioning in a cross-assistive manner, where both the positioning techniques mutually increase the positioning accuracy by complementing each other's positioning result, thus we can estimate a user's real walking trajectory with high accuracy. In the cross-assistive approach, Wi-Fi positioning detects the initial values of PDR and corrects the accumulated error of PDR. Moreover, PDR improves Wi-Fi positioning as well. In our previous research, the initial parameters for PDR are manually configured. However, we solved the problem by automatically correcting the current position and direction using the estimated values from Wi-Fi positioning. We performed experiments in the real environment in the Umeda underground shopping mall in Osaka. As a result of the evaluation, we could estimate the initial values of PDR with the probability of 84% using Wi-Fi positioning, and improved the positioning accuracy up to about 10 meters.},
