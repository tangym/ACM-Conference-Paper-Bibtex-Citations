 abstract = {Most commercial eye gaze tracking systems are based on the use of infrared lights. However, such systems may not work outdoor or may have a very limited head box for them to work. This paper proposes a non-infrared based approach to track one's eye gaze with an RGBD camera (in our case, Kinect). The proposed method adopts a personalized 3D face model constructed off-line. To detect the eye gaze, our system tracks the iris center and a set of 2D facial landmarks whose 3D locations are provided by the RGBD camera. A simple onetime calibration procedure is used to obtain the parameters of the personalized eye gaze model. We compare the performance of the proposed method against the 2D approach using only RGB input on the same images, and find that the use of depth information directly from Kinect achieves more accurate tracking. As expected, the results from the proposed method are not as accurate as the ones from infrared-based approaches. However, this method has the potential for practical use with upcoming better and cheaper depth cameras.},

Therefore, this research proposes a system that finds recipes corresponding to the user's vague requirements. On the Web, many blog-type recipes describe not only a recipe itself, but also the reasons why a given recipe were created or selected by the page authors. Firstly, the system extracts the author's reasons for the creation or selection of a recipe from the blog-type recipes. Secondly, the system lets the user input his/her present situation or feelings which must include his/her vague requirement and mine his/her reasons for recipe selection from the input. Finally, the system outputs recipes that meet the user's vague requirements by associating the reasons for recipe selection from the user's input text with the reasons accompanying the blog-type recipes.},

Early indicators for this expected wearable systems 'tsunami' are the 'spring tide' of some 5.3 billion mobile phone platforms (i.e. mobile subscribers) as of the end of 2013, and an assessed market potential for 300 million smart watches in 2014 [1]. This technological and market evolution raises questions on the potentials and opportunities of turning these massively deployed wearable systems to a globe spanning superorganism of socially interactive personal digital assistants. While the individual wearables are of heterogeneous provenance and typically act autonomously, we can assume that they can (and will) self-organize into large scale cooperative collectives, with humans being mostly out-of-the-loop [2]. We could refer to these emerging massive collectives of wearables as a "superorganism" [3], since it exhibits properties of a living organism (like e.g. 'collective intelligence') on its own.},

However, whereas traditional online interactions are explicit, offering a series of moments at which one might inform and engage the user, the growing 'era of ubiquity' has decoupled users from devices, presenting no clear moment for consent to occur. Whilst there have been efforts to raise issues of consent within HCI and cognate disciplines, these remain disparate. The aim of this workshop is to bring together a solution-oriented community with a specific focus on consent issues within interactive environments.

The collection and analysis of these data has been the focus of recent attention in ubiquitous computing, giving rise to the field known as mobile sensing. In this work, we present a collaborative extension to InCense, a toolkit to facilitate behavioral data gathering from populations of mobile phone users. InCense aims at providing people with little or no technical background with a tool that assists in the rapid design and implementation of mobile phone sensing campaigns. By extending the architecture of InCense to support distributed sensing campaigns we are able to incorporate several strategies aimed at optimizing battery, storage, and bandwidth. These issues represent significant challenges in sensing campaigns that generate considerable amounts of data (i.e., collecting audio) or quickly drain the battery in the device (i.e., GPS), given the limitations of mobile devices. In this work, collaborative sensing is used to decide which mobile phone should capture audio when two or more devices are potentially recording a similar audio signal.},

Usually an interaction with fingers couples bending and pressing. In Plex, we separate bending and pressing by placing each sensing element in discrete faces of a finger. Our proposed simple and low-cost fabrication process using conductive elastomers and threads transforms an elastic fabric into a finger-worn interaction tool. Plex preserves an inter-finger natural tactile feedback and proprioception. We also explore the interaction design and implement applications allowing users to interact with existing mobile and wearable devices using Plex.},

However, these technologies are still in their infancy and little is known whether the older adults are ready to adopt and use them. So far, most research efforts are of exploratory nature. While they identify factors which are important for the adoption and use of AAL technologies, only a few attempt to test and quantify the underlying relations between these factors. Furthermore, many studies focus on a pre-adoption stage (a technology has not been used yet) and do not consider post-adoption (users have used and experienced a technology). This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by constructing a model which tests the underlying relations between the various influencing factors across both pre-adoption and post-adoption stages.},

In this paper, we propose a social media system, Yumlog, that enables people to begin eating meals that are more healthful naturally and without conscious effort. Using the proposed system, users share information on their meals and evaluate the yumminess and healthfulness of each other's meals. The satisfaction of a user with a meal increases with others' positive evaluations. In behavioral science, this effect is called expectation assimilation. In addition, Yumlog modifies others' evaluations, displaying evaluations of healthfulness as those of yumminess to the user consuming the meal. Thus, users tend to eat more foods that are evaluated as healthful foods and thereby, improve their eating habits without noticing it. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed system through user studies.},

From this, we derive the main attacker objectives and a list of attack vectors through which these could be achieved. We propose a mapping between the attack vectors and the PN component characteristics that can be used to determine the specific attacks to which a particular component is vulnerable.

In particular, this paper delineates the method of estimating the current floor on which the user is located.

However, parents often feel limited by the rigidity of the scheduled walking bus arrival and departure times making it difficult to coordinate the delivery of children onto the bus with conflicting morning activities. As a result, most parents choose instead to rely on car journeys to the school.

Recently participatory sensing have been spreading, but its sensing tasks are still very simple and easy for participants to deal with (e.g. Please input the number of people standing in a queue. etc.). To adapt to high-level tasks which require specific skills such as those in engineering, the medical profession or authority such as the organizer of the event, we need to optimize social resource allocation because the number of such professionals are limited. To achieve the complex sensing tasks efficiently, LiPS enables to divide a complex sensing task into small tasks and link each other by assigning proper sensors. LiPS can treat physical sensors and human as hybrid multi-level sensors, and task provider can arrange social resource allocation for the goal of each divided sensing task. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the LiPS system.

Activities that have been recognized are "single" activities which can be expressed with one verb, such as sitting, walking, holding a mobile phone, and throwing a ball. In actual, however, "combined" activities including more than two kinds of state and movement are often taken place. Focusing on hand gestures, they are performed not only while standing, but also while walking and sitting. Though the simplest way to recognize such combined activities is to construct the recognition models for all the possible combinations of the activities, the number of combinations becomes immense. In this paper, we propose a recognition method for combined activities by learning single activities only. Evaluation results confirmed that our proposed method achieved 0.84 of recall and 0.85 of precision, which is comparable to the method that had learned all the combined activities.},

We ran a longitudinal mixed-methods effectiveness study using the Fitbit Zip activity tracker with 50 participants. In this paper we present two main challenges experienced during this study: the unreliability of the device and a lack of engagement by some of the participants. The issues we experienced can help inform the design of future studies.},

The system consists of a Mobile Application that collects sensor data from the smartphone and from additional external wearable devices through a Bluetooth connection. We designed it to be user friendly, transparent, unobtrusive and able to provide smart sensing strategies in order to preserve battery life. Moreover, i-Log has a back-end server that accepts streams of data from the application and stores them into a persistent storage system that can be queried for further real time analysis.},

In our research, we are interested in exploring the intrinsic string that connects all these events together, that is, user status and transitions. Such transitions can be reflected from multiple activity dimensions, ranging from our daily mobility trajectories, app usage sequences, to communication patterns and motion state switches. In this paper, we aim to identify whether a personalized model can be learned to capture various user states from different sensing dimensions and whether a unified view can be established to explain the state transitions that drive the changes in user context during day-to-day routines. To this end, we have explored two types of traces -- connected wifi sequences and cell location trajectories. We first model the states among these two individual dimensions. In the end, the identified states from both dimensions are linked together to recognize the spatial-temporal relationship between them. As we evaluate with the DeviceAnalyzer dataset, our method is able to recognize a range of states such as "at home", "working", "commute" and the trasitions between them, all in an unsupervised manner.},

Our results show that the probability of users to generate data traffic while connected to Wi-Fi is twice as high as when a cellular connection only is available. Furthermore, we observe that an almost constant amount of data traffic is generated over a day, although it slightly increases in the late afternoon. Last but not least, we observe that fair-use policies do not seem to influence the behavior of mobile users with respect to the amount of traffic they generate over different weeks of a month. We ground our analysis on the Device Analyzers data set, which contains detailed records of mobile phone usage of more than 17,000 users from all over the world.

Automatic analysis methods developed for remote-, and tower-mounted eye-trackers do not take this into account and are therefore not suitable to use for data where also head- and body movements are present. As a result, data recorded with a mobile eye-tracker are often analyzed manually. In this work, we investigate how simultaneous recordings of eye- and head movements can be employed to isolate the motion of the eye in the eye-tracking data. We recorded eye-in-head movements with a mobile eye-tracker and head movements with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Preliminary results show that by compensating the eye-tracking data with the estimated head orientation, the standard deviation of the data during vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) eye movements, was reduced from 8.0° to 0.9° in the vertical direction and from 12.9° to 0.6° in the horizontal direction. This suggests that a head compensation algorithm based on IMU data can be used to isolate the movements of the eye and therefore simplify the analysis of data recorded using a mobile eye-tracker.},

 abstract = {Today's abundance of cheap digital storage in the form of tiny memory cards put literally no bounds on the number of images one can capture with one's digital camera or camera phone during an event. However, studies have shown that taking many pictures may actually make us remember less of a particular event. In this position paper, we propose to re-introduce the paradigm of old film camera in the context of modern smartphones. The purpose is to investigate how users will behave when a significant capture limitation is imposed in a picture-taking context, and in what kind of pictures this will result. Ultimately, we are interested in the effect on memory recall of such a limitation, and describe a potential study setup that will help us explore this question.},

The estimation accuracy can be improved by recognizing regions of food objects and ingredients contained in those regions. In this paper, we propose a method that estimates nutritional information based on segmentation and labeling of food regions of an image by adopting a semantic segmentation method, in which we consider recipes as corresponding sets of food images and ingredient labels. Any food object or ingredient in a test food image can be annotated as long as the ingredient is contained in a training food image, even if the menu containing the food image appears for the first time. Experimental results show that better estimation is achieved through regression analysis using ingredient labels associated with the segmented regions than when using the local feature of pixels as the predictor variable.},

When using an RFID tag, the card reader is placed at the entrance and recognition only occurs when entering the room in most cases. Thus, the information required to enter is only recognized during entry but not when leaving. In this paper, we propose a method for exit recognition that uses an illuminometer and an accelerometer embedded in a mobile sensor, which assesses the changes in the illuminance and acceleration data for subjects. We analyze the walking data obtained from the feature values of the acceleration data and the exit data derived from the feature values of the illuminance. We found that this method achieves 87.60% of accuracy for exit recognition.},

Our approach uses mobile phones and accelerometers to detect interpersonal spatial and speech related features, achieving accuracy of around 80% in classifying between formal and informal social interactions, based on the study of 53 social interactions. One of the potential impacts of this work is on studying communication channels to enable more efficient knowledge transfer between knowledge workers.

However, the consensus is that improving communication between workers requires deeper understanding of both formal and informal types of interactions.},

To understand the significance of the problem and core factors that cause such embarrassments, we collected 961 in-situ responses from 14 participants upon the actual message arrival and analyzed them from the perspective of the receiver's situation. The results showed that 29% of message arrivals have the potential to cause embarrassment.

We use an automated activity recognition algorithm to recognize a smart home resident's activities of daily living from the generated sensor data, and introduce a Compare and Count (2C) algorithm to quantify the changes in everyday behavior. We test our approach using a longitudinal sensor dataset that we collected from 18 single-resident smart homes for nearly two years and study the relationship between observed changes in the sensor-based everyday functioning parameters and changes in standard clinical health assessment scores. The results suggest that we may be able to develop sensor-based change algorithms that can predict specific components of cognitive and physical health.},

 abstract = {In recent years, a positioning method which utilizes wireless LAN without using GPS has attracted attention. Especially, in the case of a method which combines absolute position with a Wi-Fi radio environment in advance, the cost of operation and management becomes enormous. Therefore, by sampling Wi-Fi radio information observed at points where users stay frequently or in the long-term, a method which automates to collect and update the Wi-Fi radio information has been proposed. In the case of a long-term operating, the positioning accuracy, however, decreases because this method does not perform well in maintaining and managing samples. It cannot adapt samples to environmental changes although Wi-Fi radio signals change in case of long-term operating. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new calculation formula for improving a positioning accuracy. The formula is calculated with the weight of each base station for avoidance of ill-behaving stations. In addition, this paper also proposes the automated management system with two steps. It adapts samples to changes of Wi-Fi radio signals and a user's behavior. As a result, a positioning accuracy of the new system is higher than existing one.},

Finally, the personalized scheduling strategy is generated to meet the different users' demands at the minimal cost. The major contributions of this paper are: 1) NILM is an low-cost and easy-accept solution to profile users' demand, since power meters have been widely deployed and power consumption data are less privacy-related. 2) Five preference indexes are firstly introduced, which can dramatically improve the user's satisfaction on scheduling strategies.},

However, such direct engagement has its limitations as users typically show only limited tolerance for unwanted interruptions such as prompts for annotations. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of approaches to online, user-based annotation of activity data. Our central assumption is the existence of a fixed, limited budget of annotations a user is willing to provide. We evaluate different strategies on how to spend such a budget most effectively. Using the Opportunity benchmark we simulate online annotation scenarios for a variety of budget configurations and we show that effective online annotation can still be achieved using reduced annotation effort.},

 abstract = {The increasing popularity of wearable devices that continuously capture video, and the prevalence of third-party applications that utilize these feeds have resulted in a new threat to privacy. In many situations, sensitive objects/regions are maliciously (or accidentally) captured in a video frame by third-party applications. However, current solutions do not allow users to specify and enforce fine grained access control over video feeds. In this paper, we describe MarkIt, a computer vision based privacy marker framework, that allows users to specify and enforce fine grained access control over video feeds. We present two example privacy marker systems -- PrivateEye and WaveOff. We conclude with a discussion of the computer vision, privacy and systems challenges in building a comprehensive system for fine grained access control over video feeds.},

The capabilities of activity recognition to detect, store and present activities to the person who has performed it can not only help to recall the activities but also encourage the user to remember experiences related to the activities. In order to demonstrate this, we present two projects (cases) in which wearable activity recognition is used to support the users' recall capabilities. In the next step, we present a narrative theory of action and mind, which focuses on how humans retrospectively interpret and structure personal experience in their minds, their so called autobiographical memory. Finally, we present some further concepts and distinctions about what it means to memorize and recall personal data.},

Conversation often takes place where a part of the participants have meals. To better understand co-dining conversation, we should also pay attention to this uneven meal distribution setting. Thus this research investigated face-to-face dyadic conversation on uneven meal distribution setting, focused on the difference between the participant with meal and the one without meal in particular. Conversation scenes that one participant has a meal were videotaped, and questionnaires were asked to fill out. From the analysis, it was found that attentive listening was often likely to emerge in uneven meal distribution setting.},

In the process of comparing our AR research to other efforts, however, we found that most AR data sets are sufficiently limited as to impact the reliability of existing research results, and that many AR research papers do not clearly document their experimental methodology and often make unrealistic assumptions. In this paper we outline problems and limitations with AR data sets and describe the methodology problems we noticed, in the hope that this will lead to the creation of improved and better documented data sets and improved AR experimental methodology. Although we cover a broad array of methodological issues, our primary focus is on an often overlooked factor, model type, which determines how AR training and test data are partitioned---and how AR models are evaluated. Our prior research indicates that personal, hybrid, and impersonal/universal models yield dramatically different performance [30], yet many research studies do not highlight or even identify this factor. We make concrete recommendations to address these issues and also describe our own publically available AR data sets.},

Mobile device synchronization can be done via the Internet or GPS, but both are not available in all areas. This paper presents our novel approach "Event Driven Time Synchronization of Mobile Devices" that works anytime, anywhere. The idea is to trigger sensor events on each device as much as possible at the same time. The time difference of the sensor event occurrences is interpreted as the time difference between the devices, called time offset between the devices. Our prototype utilizes proximity events to enable this. Our evaluation shows that 99% of the time offsets vary not more than 60 ms. Compared to this, only 17% are within this variance when using Network Time Protocol via a mobile High Speed Downlink Packet Access Internet connection.},

 abstract = {In this position paper we outline a technology concept for making new situations and encounters more familiar and less threatening. Going to new places, interacting with new people and carrying out new tasks is part of everyday life. New situations create a sense of excitement but in many cases also anxiety based on a fear of the unknown. Our concept uses the metaphor of a pin board as peripheral display to automatically provide advance information about potential future experiences. By providing references to and information about future events and situations we aim at creating a "feeling of having already experienced the present situation" (term Déjà vu as defined in the Oxford Dictionary) once people are in a new situation. This draws on the positive definition of the concept of déjà vu. In this paper we outline our idea and use scenarios illustrate its potential. We assess different ways the concept can be realized and chart potential technology for content creation and for presentation. We also present a discussion of the impact on human memory and how this changes experiences.},

 abstract = {Activity recognition systems have demonstrated potential in a broad range of applications. A crucial aspect of creating large scale human activity sensing corpus is to develop algorithms that perform activity recognition in a way that users are not limited to wear sensors on predefined locations on the body. Therefore, effective on-body sensor localization algorithms are needed to detect the location of wearable sensors automatically and in real-time. However, power optimization is a major concern in the design of these systems. Frequent need to charge multiple sensor nodes imposes much burden on the end-users. In this paper, we propose a novel signal processing approach that leverages feature selection algorithms to minimize power consumption of node localization. With the real data collected using wearable motion sensors, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an energy saving that ranges from 88% to 99.59% while obtaining an accuracy performance between 73.15% and 99.85%.},

We detect user presence by sensing the proximity of a subset of their possessions, making the process automatic and effortless. As in previous work, a master key unlocks the device and a secret-sharing scheme allows us to reconstruct this master key in the presence of k-out-of-n items. We extend this basic scheme in various directions, e.g. by allowing items to issue a dynamically variable number of shares based on how confident they are that the user is present. The position we argue in this paper is that a multi-dimensional approach to authentication that fuses several contextual inputs, similar to that already adopted by major web sites, can also bring advantages at the local scale.},

We studied various new and fine-grained user contexts which are relevant to students' daily activities, such as "in class and interested in the learned materials" and "on my way to campus". These contexts might later be utilized for various purposes such as recommending relevant items to the students' context. We compare various machine learning methods and report their effectiveness for the purposes of inferring the users' context from the collected data.

@proceedings{Mattern:2013:2493432,
 abstract = {Welcome to the proceedings of the 2013 ACM Joint International Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp 2013) -- the first proceedings after the merger of the two most prestigious conferences in the field of Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing. We were very happy to receive a record number of submissions for this inaugural edition: 305 full papers and 89 notes, for a total of 394 submissions. This is almost exactly the number of submission that the two individual conferences received in 2011 combined! We take this as a sign of strong support from the community, and hope that our efforts of creating an exciting, high quality program this year will ensure that future editions will continue this growth. We had three aims in this year's edition: to further grow the community with the help of an inclusive program; to maintain the high quality of the constituting conference series Pervasive and UbiComp; and to ensure our review processes could handle the expected growth. Previously, both Pervasive and UbiComp had average acceptance rates of well below 20% (averaging 17% and 16% in the last 8 years, respectively). We believe that consistently rejecting some 85% of all submitted work does not help with maintaining a healthy and vibrant community. We thus took a cue from the updated submission processes at other premium conference series, such as the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW), and introduced a new "revise & resubmit" decision as part of the Program Committee (PC) meeting outcome. "Revise & resubmit" roughly corresponded to the decision "Major Revision Required" in a journal review process: the authors received a detailed set of reviews, along with an editorial "meta review" outlining core issues that needed to be addressed in order to have a chance at being accepted in a second review round. Four weeks later, the original set of PC members who discussed the submission at the PC meeting got together in an online meeting to evaluate the quality of the revised paper. In case all conditions were met, the paper was accepted. Given the novelty of this process, the Program Committee was relatively cautious with inviting authors for a resubmission. Out of the 394 submission, 71 were accepted or conditionally accepted at the PC meeting, while an additional 34 submissions (8.6% of the total) were invited to revise and resubmit. They were given a concrete list of issues and 4 weeks' time to submit a revision. 29 revisions were received. Out of these, 22 had significantly improved and were ultimately accepted into the program, while for 7 submissions the reviewers found that -- despite the changes -- they were still not ready for publication. We thus have a total of 92 accepted submissions, which not only makes for a healthy 23.4% acceptance rate but also represents the largest program ever in the history of the two conferences -- even when combining all papers presented in a single year at both venues (cf. Figure 2). Overall, we believe that this process helped to grow the breadth and scope of the program while maintaining the high quality expected at a top-tier conference venue like UbiComp. The above description should also illustrate well the efforts undertaken by this year's Program Committee to gather, select, and improve the work submitted to the conference. This year saw not only the largest number of accepted papers, but also the largest Program Committee ever: 75 PC members, together with over 350 external experts, wrote a total of 1647 reviews in the course of the review process. After further considering each submission via an online discussion forum, 208 submissions (52.7%) were selected for discussion at the two-day face-to-face PC meeting in Paris, France, on May 3-4, 2013. Each of us three PC Chairs moderated a group of roughly 25 PC members, working mostly in parallel but repeatedly synchronizing and calibrating in plenary sessions -- also thanks to the continuing "exchange" of PC members across groups. The parallel sessions saw a frenzy of activity, as additional experts were constantly being drafted from the various meeting rooms by a helpful staff of 6 student volunteers, in order to provide additional input on particular paper discussions elsewhere -- all coordinated by a huge schedule spreadsheet that would consider both conflicts of interests and reviewer availability across all three groups. The amount of expertise and community-history represented by the 70+ PC members present at the meeting was truly invigorating.},

While the individual wearables are of heterogeneous provenance and typically act autonomously, we can assume that they can (and will) self-organize into large scale cooperative collectives, with humans being mostly out-of-the-loop [2]. We may not assume a common objective or central controller, but rather volatile network topologies, co-dependence and internal competition, non-linear and non-continuous dynamics, and sub-ideal, failure prone operation. We could refer to these emerging massive collectives of wearables as a "super-organism" [7], since it exhibits properties of a living organism (like e.g. 'collective intelligence') on its own. In order to properly exploit such super-organisms, we need to develop a deeper scientific understanding of the foundational principles by which they operate.},

In this application, case data associated with the sensor information and type of action is required. However, there is a possibility that a time shift occurs because this association is done manually on the audio and video that has been acquired along with the sensor information. In this paper, we propose a method of activity recognition that can recognize correct actions even if there is a time gap. In this method, we add labels that shift the original learning data label. We also implement multi-label machine learning. In addition, we propose a method for repeated learning based on the Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm. To evaluate this method, we conducted an experiment that recognized three types of behavior using a Naive Bayes classifier. In the evaluation, we pieced together three types of human action data into one dataset called pseudo sequence data. We slid the action labels of the pseudo sequence data and examined whether the recognition rate was improved by our proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can perform activity recognition with high accuracy, even if the action labels times are shifted.},

 abstract = {2014 has been another incredible year for Ubiquitous Computing, as body worn, mobile, sensor rich technologies pervade every aspect of our daily lives and the augment the infrastructures and environments we inhabit, and instigates changes in our societies. Such technologies both enable new practices and behaviours, but also challenge us to consider the role and impact of such technologies are having on our lives, and even to question our very rights and entitlements. This year's program reflects the full gamut of these endeavours, from fundamental techniques in sensing, activity recognition, and security on mobiles, to focused interventions in healthcare and for specialist applications. We are particularly delighted to welcome our keynote, Gaetano Borriello, who's work on Open Data Kit is leading to new Applications of Mobile Devices in the Developing World, inspiring us to think how we might transform lives using ubiquitous technologies within our own work.},

@inproceedings{Templeman:2014:RSR:2638728.2641708,
 abstract = {Consumer electronic devices like smartphones increasingly feature arrays of sensors that can 'see', 'hear', and 'feel' the environment around them. While these devices began with primitive capabilities, newer generations of electronics offer sophisticated sensing arrays that collect high-fidelity representations of the physical world. For example, wearable cameras are becoming more prevalent with new consumer lifelogging products including the Narrative Clip, Autographer, and Google Glass. These wearable cameras give computing devices a persistent sense of sight, raising important concerns about protecting people's privacy. At the same time, these devices also provide opportunities for enhancing security, by allowing trusted devices to observe and react to the physical environment surrounding the user and the device. We propose Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to mediate access to sensors and their data using attributes of the context and content of sensor information. Attributes extracted from sensor data could be used to trigger policy actions ranging from sharing or not sharing images, to invoking system changes in reaction to outside visual stimuli such as automatically shutting down network interfaces when in the presence of unknown people. While prior work has addressed some specific actions, like preventing potentially private images from being shared based on their location, in this paper we present and advocate for a more general working definition of ABAC that applies to sensors and sensor data. We also present use cases for how this reactive security approach may help protect the privacy and security of users.},

Atmos leverages a crowd-sourcing network of mobile devices for the collection of in situ weather related sensory data, provided by available on-board sensors, along with human input, to generate highly localized information about current and future weather conditions. In this paper, we share our first insights of an 8-month long deployment of Atmos mobile app on Google Play that gathered data from a total of 9 countries across 3 continents. Furthermore, we describe the underlying system infrastructure and showcase how a hybrid people-centric and environment-centric approach to weather estimation could benefit forecasting. Finally, we present our preliminary results originating from questionnaires inquiring into how people perceive the weather, how they use technology to know about the weather and how it affects their habits.},

 abstract = {The next revolution in mobile user experience is predicted to be a smart device that can adapt to its user's lifestyle and surroundings to become a proactive personal assistant. We introduce the idea of Mobile Sequence Mining (MSM) engine that automatically learns phone usage sequential patterns over the rich context data captured within the device. The learned patterns can then enable variety of applications including proactive assistance for a variety of use cases. Unlike existing cloud-based intelligence services (e.g., GoogleNow) that rely on internet access and may compromise privacy, MSM provides device intelligence by leveraging mined longitudinal patterns while preserving privacy via on-device mining. MSM is generic and can provide sequential patterns and predictions over multiple data streams, also allowing individual mobile applications to stream their own private data to mine sequential patterns. In our preliminary tests by deploying MSM on 3 user devices, it mines frequent sequential patterns within 8 minutes over 7-53 days of longitudinal user context data including location, app usage and call logs spanning 137-312 unique contexts. We conclude the paper by enumerating future research challenges for mobile sequence mining.},

 abstract = {Living alone in their own residence, older adults are at-risk for late assessment of physical or cognitive changes due to many factors such as their impression that such changes are simply a normal part of aging or their reluctance to admit to a problem. Sensors networks have emerged in the last decade as a possible solution to older adult health monitoring and early illness recognition. Typical early illness recognition approaches are either concentrated on the detection of a given set of activities such as a fall or walks, or on the detection of anomalies such as too many bathroom visits. In this paper we propose a new illness recognition framework, MFA, based on detecting a missing frequent activity from the daily routine. MFA is implemented using a frequent temporal pattern detection algorithm and demonstrated on a pilot dataset collected in TigerPlace, an aging in place community from Columbia, Missouri.},

@inproceedings{Kenneally:2014:RSN:2638728.2641685,
 abstract = {The stability of trust on the Internet has implications for political diplomacy, innovation, economic stability, social and civil relations, and individual self-determinism. The degree of online trust is a reflection of the gap between individual and collective Netizens' expectations formed by laws and ethics, and their capabilities enabled by technology. Law and ethics, just as with familiar offline society, act as ordering forces that inform the acceptability of our behaviors and relationships with other person and organizations. The migration of these analog activities online has exposed a rather sweeping gap between expectations and capabilities, where legal and ethical ordering forces are challenged to re-examine, -interpret, and --apply the tenets and principles upon which they moor. As this gap widens, so too does ambiguity between asserted rights, interests, and threats to same. This gap is manifest most prominently in the current industrial and geo-political struggle to define rules of engagement for cyber conflict and national security, as well as with online advertising and data brokering. A related context where ordering forces are challenged, lower on the public notoriety index but no less considerable, is information and communication technology (ICT) research. The controversy over the collection, use and disclosure of online data for research exposes gaps and deficiencies in the legal and ethical structures that directly and indirectly inform and reflect our expectations. Notably, "consent" has been a fundamental mechanism for protecting rights and interests in both law and ethics. As such, it serves as an institutionalized signal for persons' reasonable expectations. Yet, the ability to easily collect and combine massive amounts of existing, "publicly-available" information of a sensitive nature (personal or confidential) online exposes deficiencies in consent as an effective signal for expectations. More specifically, researchers increasingly encounter data online such as personal health, financial or behavioral records; usernames and passwords lists; corporate manuals and technical documents; email and voice communications databases; and, device vulnerabilities and machine-to-machine communications. It is located in various online locations ranging from normal websites and social networks to underground criminal forums, Internet relay chat rooms, and publicly-obscured/hidden sites. And, its availability is often a product of malicious, negligent, or ignorant collection or disclosure by a third party. In this context, consent as an expectation signal is strained along substantive and procedural dimensions. For example, some argue that the existence of other signals (i.e., the data was public and/or non-identifiable, the purpose of the research is to study a system or threat and not individual persons) pre-empts the need for consent. In addition, obtaining consent for what amounts to secondary use of online data may be impracticable in light of the distance between researchers and data subjects, or outweighed by countervailing intended benefits or academic freedom interests. With research using data available online, researcher conduct is not fully prescribed or proscribed by formal ethical codes of conduct or law because current expectations signals are ill-fitting. This presentation is intended to advance the collective dialogue toward a path that revisits and harmonizes ethical and legal signals for research using online data among researchers, oversight entities, policymakers and society. It does not dictate answers but aims to point out where current ordering forces breakdown in the context of online research and to suggest how to identify and respond to these grey areas by applying common legal and ethical tenets.},

Moreover, sensor types are often selected and optimized so as to accord with the goal of application. The complexity makes those systems infeasible to be deployed for new settings. This paper proposes a unified system which works with any available wearable sensors placed on user's body to spot activities. Each data stream is treated uniformly through our proposed template matching WarpingLCSS to spot activities. With the uniformity in extracting activity-specific patterns from raw sensor signals, our proposed system is compatible with respect to modalities and body-worn positions. We evaluate our system on the Opportunity dataset of four subjects consisting of 17 hard-to-classify classes (e.g., open/close drawers at different heights) with 17 sensors belonging to three modalities (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetic field) attached at different on-body positions. The system achieves good performances (63% to 84% in F1 score). Moreover, the robustness and efficiency to addition and removal of sensors as well as activity classes are also investigated.},

 abstract = {This research addresses improvement of the accuracy of pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), which is one effective technique to estimate indoor positions using smartphone sensors. Even though various techniques using step lengths and their number have been previously proposed for PDR, insufficient accuracy is gotten from smartphone sensors. In this research, we define human activity sensing knowledge and propose improvements to PDR accuracy based on it. Human activity sensing knowledge consists of four kinds of information: pedestrian, environmental, activity, and terminal. Previous studies separately used these kinds of information; however, no study has systematically arranged them for use in PDR. We improved PDR accuracy by adjusting the step length in passages and on stairs and revised activity recognition error with human activity sensing knowledge. To investigate the effectiveness of that strategy, we used HASC-IPSC, which is an indoor pedestrian sensing corpus. After our investigation, activity recognition accuracy improved from 71.2% to 91.4%, and the distance estimation error was reduced from approximately 27 m to approximately 7 m using human activity sensing knowledge.},

 abstract = {Behavioural change interventions represent a powerful means for tackling a number of health and well-being issues, from obesity to stress and addiction. In the current medical practice, the change is induced through tailored coaching, support and information delivery. However, with the advent of smartphones, innovative ways of delivering interventions are emerging. Indeed, mobile phones, equipped with an array of sensors, and carried by their users at all times, enable therapists to both learn about the user behaviour, and impact the behaviour through the delivery of more relevant and personalised information. In this work we propose harnessing pervasive computing to not only learn from users' past behaviour, but also predict future actions and emotional states, deliver interventions proactively, evaluate their impact at run-time, and over time learn a personal intervention-effect model of a participant.},

From training and testing activity recognition models, to verifying hypotheses in social science, mobile data is indispensable. Unfortunately, mobile data collection requires significant time and budget for infrastructure as well as subject recruiting, screening, training, legal agreements, equipment, and compensation. We estimate up to 70% of the resources in a study may be spent on data collection. Moreover, this massive investment can combine with institutional, legal, and political issues to create a disincentive to sharing with the community. In this paper, we propose and justify a crowdfunded and crowdsourced methodology for longitudinal mobile data collection that cuts researcher costs by orders of magnitude, removes barriers to data sharing, and boosts data value for all stakeholders. We also present CrowdSignals, a first instantiation which will generate the largest labeled mobile dataset available to the community.},

Due to the high variance in house configurations and sensor placements, it is important to collect and label sample sensor data that will be used to train a learning algorithm. Ground-truth activity labels must therefore be provided in some manner for this sample data. The abundance of sensor data makes it infeasible to label all of the data, and active learning can be used to intelligently pick the most informative data to be labeled. In this paper, we describe several active learning methods that we designed and implemented for their applicability to the activity recognition task.

 abstract = {We didn't start the fire, it was always burning since technology became integrated into wearable things that can be traced back to the early 1500s. This earliest forms of wearable technology were manifested as pocket watches. Of course technology changed and evolved, but again it might be the watch, now in form of a wrist worn smart watch, that could carve the way towards an always on, large scale, planet spanning, body sensor network. The challenge arises on how to handle this enormous scale of upcoming smart watches and the produced data. This work highlights a strategy on how to make use of the massive amount of smart watches in building goal oriented, dynamically evolving network structures that autonomously adapt to changes in the smart watch ecosystem like cells do in the human organism.},

However, conventional approaches for training classifiers struggle with social contexts that are incrementally constructed and continuously discovered in everyday environments. Incremental social contexts can confuse a classifier because it assumes that the number and composition of context classes is fixed throughout training and inference phases. To address this challenge we propose ContextSense, an ELM-based learning method for continuous and unobtrusive discovery of new social contexts incrementally from dynamic bluetooth data. Experimental results show that ContextSense can automatically cope with "incremental social context" classes that appear unpredictably in the real-world.},

Many connected devices are nowadays being accessed through applications running on mobile devices instead of tangible controls. Whilst this ubiquitous access is highly convenient, it is also making connected devices more vulnerable. As such, we reintroduce location-constrained interaction, adapted to connected devices present in a modern home, and explore three design cardinals: (i) spatial granularity, (ii) roles and delegation, and (iii) access control. We report on a qualitative study that explored this design space through a prototype geo-fenced connected lighting system. Our findings suggest that users would like to have geo-fencing for a subset of connected devices, prefer to define geo-fences statically but with different granularities for different devices, and desire access control through location verification and credentials.},

A smart shelf with RFID has been set up to which a AR marker has been added to be able to map physical to screen coordinates. Testing and validation of system is done with different number of books at different locations on a shelf.

Our target space is a shelf equipped with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) containing changing number of DVDs and books. The mouse is replaced by a smartphone acting as a touch pad, the cursor is replaced by a controllable moving head beam light that projects a spot on the shelf and the information about the products near the cursor's position is then shown on a heads-up display (HUD) such as Google Glass. The items can be localized and visualized at HUD with an accuracy of 99%. The system is developed in context to independent living i.e. wheelchair users.},

In a novel approach, we propose recording of events, interaction, and annotations in order to access characteristics that communicate the reasoning behind the decision-making of care providers. Recording is done with free-form and implicit data collection, and communication of spatio-chronological characteristics of events, interactions, and annotations are done with augmented interfaces. This enables care providers, who make decisions, to identify what factors have played the most significant role in the decision-making. In the context of chronic care, this research is aiming at, better understanding how to capture and communicate the medical decision-making process. Our preliminary experiments show success in communicating the reasoning processes of the document analysis sessions in a lab environment.

Although jaundice is common in healthy newborns, early detection of extreme jaundice is essential to prevent brain damage or death.

 abstract = {In indoor positioning using Wi-Fi, there is a problem that the accuracy is not stable by the occurrence of large errors. Large errors tend to occur when density of wireless LAN access points is low or the radio wave condition is unstable. Furthermore, as for positioning utilising smartphone, it takes a while to scan Wi-Fi beacons. Thereby, errors tend to occur while user is moving. Because it is difficult to observe exactly Wi-Fi beacons. Accordingly, the authors proposed Cross-Assistive Approach for PDR and Wi-Fi Positioning. First of all, fingerprinting that is often used Wi-Fi positioning is improved by confining fingerprints to location where is estimated by PDR. As a result, this approach improved the accuracy about 2 meters. Furthermore, in order to correct accumulated errors in PDR, the authors proposed a method that corrects PDR with accurate Wi-Fi positioning results. Additionally, the authors proposed a method that estimates the accuracy of Wi-Fi positioning results. The mean error of accurate Wi-Fi results estimated by the accuracy estimating method was 0.98 meters. Thus, the accuracy estimating method detected accurate Wi-Fi positioning results effectively. In the comprehensive evaluation, our approach improved an existing Wi-Fi method about 3.4 meters by assisted PDR with Wi-Fi positioning and assisted Wi-Fi positioning with PDR cooperatively. Moreover, this approach enabled accumulated errors in PDR to be corrected.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the predictive way to evolve the process of the health consultancy by predictive methods with machine learning. We have tried health consultancy for over 22,000 patients with caravan health sensing in Bangladesh during 2012-2014. In health consultancy with caravan health sensing, doctors' task becomes the bottleneck of the whole process because of the cost and the huge workload, and we try to delegate some of them to health workers who are less skilled. In this paper, we propose a method to predict the advices of doctors from the inquiry, vital data, and the chief complaints of the patients, and to delegate the task to health workers, resulting in eliminating the bottleneck. We also evaluate the accuracy of the prediction of advices from the 931 patients who have taken the doctors' consultancy out of the above experiment. We got the predict accuracy 76.24% with inquiry and vital data, and 82.55% with adding chief complaints data.},
