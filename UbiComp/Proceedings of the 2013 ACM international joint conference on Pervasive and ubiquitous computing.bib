We focus on the group nearest neighbor (GNN) query that allows a group to meet at their nearest point of interest such as a restaurant that minimizes the total or maximum distance of the group. We develop a crowdsource-based approach, called PrivateMeetUp, to evaluate GNN queries in a privacy preserving manner and implement a working prototype of PrivateMeetUp.},

In contrast to previous approaches, we use the smartphone to monitor firefighters during real-world missions in order to provide objective data that can be used in post-incident briefings and trainings. In this paper, we present CoenoFire, a smartphone based sensing system aimed at monitoring temporal and behavioral performance indicators of firefighting missions. We validate the performance metrics showing that they can indicate why certain teams performed faster than others in a training scenario conducted by 16 firefighting teams. Furthermore, we deployed CoenoFire over a period of six weeks in a professional fire brigade. In total, 71 firefighters participated in our study and the collected data includes 76 real-world missions totaling to over 148 hours of mission data. Additionally, we visualize real-world mission data and show how mission feedback is supported by the data.},

Based on a detailed study of four university students over several months, we explore how Ubicomp technologies can help create a more sustainable reality where people are more active in pursuing and maintaining their thermal comfort, and environments are less tightly controlled and less energy-intensive, and we outline areas for future research in this domain.},

Here we report on two studies that capture users' experiences with a user-centered battery interface design. In Study 1, we analyze 12 participants' use of mobile phones, demonstrating that mobile phone users do not know how or what to do to extend their mobile's battery life. We further identify the information they rely on to assess battery life. In Study 2, we use this information to design, prototype and evaluate an interactive battery interface (IBI) with another 22 participants. Our findings describe how users perceive battery life and how we used their mental models of mobile phone batteries to create IBI. Lastly, we report on the users' experiences and IBI's effect on battery lifetime, showing gains of approximately 27% over the course of a day.},

 abstract = {Location sharing is a popular feature of online social networks, but challenges remain in the effective presentation of privacy choices to users, whose location sharing preferences are complex and diverse. One proposed approach for capturing these nuances builds on the observation that key attributes of users' location sharing preferences can be represented by a small number of privacy profiles, which can provide a basis for configuring individual preferences. However, the impact of this approach on how users view their privacy is relatively unknown. We present a study evaluating the impact of this approach on users' location sharing preferences and their satisfaction with the decisions made by their resulting settings. The results suggest that this approach can influence users to share significantly more without a substantial difference in comfort. This further suggests that the provision of profiles for privacy settings must be carefully considered, as they can substantially alter sharing behavior.},

 abstract = {The adjunct program has always been a very important part of the UbiComp and Pervasive conference series, and this year is no exception. The conference is preceded by no less than two full days of workshops, featuring 18 one-day workshops, one two-day workshop, and a two-day Doctoral School. Posters, demos, and videos are scheduled at key moments within the main conference schedule: demos form the highlight of the Welcome Reception on the first day, posters are shown in two 2-hour "munch-and-mingle" lunch sessions, and videos are woven into the regular session program. Long-time attendees of the respective conference series have come to appreciate the many opportunities that the adjunct program offers for creating interactions among community members. This year we received a total number of 202 submissions to the adjunct program: 30 workshop proposals, 27 video submissions, 47 demo submissions, and 98 poster submissions. The 2013 workshop program is the largest of any previous UbiComp or Pervasive conference. Out of the 21 workshops that were selected, 18 eventually decided to include their papers in this volume and in the ACM Digital Library. The video, demo, and poster program is equally impressive. As in previous years, it was possible to submit one piece of work simultaneously as a video, demo, and poster, giving authors the opportunity to present their work in different presentation formats and ultimately receiving significantly more face-time with conference attendees. Approximately 20% of the video, demo, and poster submissions took advantage of this opportunity, with the combination "poster and demo" being the most popular combination (13 submissions). All submissions were peer-reviewed by at least one reviewer, with two or more reviews being assigned when necessary. We were able to accept 105 submissions (27 demos, 11 videos, and 67 posters), which results in an acceptance rate of 63% for the adjunct track. All associated extended abstracts (4 pages in the SICGHI landscape format) are available through the ACM digital library as part of the Adjunct Proceedings of UbiComp 2013. As in the past, authors of accepted papers for the main program were able to present their work also in the adjunct track, without submitting a separate extended abstract. Authors of 23 of the 92 accepted full papers and notes took advantage of this option and presented their work also a poster, demo, or video (or a combination of these) at the conference. Our thanks go to all authors who submitted their work to the UbiComp 2013 adjunct track -- your active participation in this conference series is a key ingredient to its vibrancy and scientific mrelevance. We sincerely hope that you will enjoy the adjunct program as much as we did when organizing it!},

Central to this approach of 'instant inkjet circuits' is the ability to print highly conductive traces and patterns onto flexible substrates such as paper and plastic films cheaply and quickly. In addition to providing an alternative to breadboarding and conventional printed circuits, we demonstrate how this technique readily supports large area sensors and high frequency applications such as antennas. Unlike existing methods for printing conductive patterns, conductivity emerges within a few seconds without the need for special equipment. We demonstrate that this technique is feasible using commodity inkjet printers and commercially available ink, for an initial investment of around US$300. Having presented this exciting new technology, we explain the tools and techniques we have found useful for the first time. Our main research contribution is to characterize the performance of instant inkjet circuits and illustrate a range of possibilities that are enabled by way of several example applications which we have built. We believe that this technology will be of immediate appeal to researchers in the ubiquitous computing domain, since it supports the fabrication of a variety of functional electronic device prototypes.},

 abstract = {Simulating human-centered pervasive systems requires accurate assumptions on the behavior of human groups. Recent models consider this behavior as a combination of both social and spatial factors. Yet, establishing accurate traces of human groups is difficult: current techniques capture either positions, or contacts, with a limited accuracy. In this paper we introduce a new technique to capture such behaviors. The interest of this approach lies in the unprecedented accuracy at which both positions and orientations of humans, even gathered in a crowd, are captured. From the mobility to the topological connectivity, the open-source framework we developed offers a layered approach that can be tailored, allowing to compare and reason about models and traces. We introduce a new trace of 50 individuals on which the validity and accuracy of this approach is demonstrated. To showcase the interest of our software pipeline, we compare it against the random waypoint model. Our fine-grained analyses, that take into account social interactions between users, show that the random waypoint model is not a reasonable approximation of any of the phenomena we observed.},

Our interest is in examining user behavior in the growing domain of mobile video, and in particular how users behave in such video chat services as they are extended onto mobile clients. To date, over four thousand people have downloaded and used our Android-based mobile client, which was developed to be compatible with an existing video chat service. The paper provides a first-ever detailed large scale study of mobile user behavior in a random video chat service over a three week period. This study identifies major characteristics such as mobile user session durations, time of use, demographic distribution and the large number of brief sessions that users click through to find good matches. Through content analysis of video and audio, as well as analysis of texting and clicking behavior, we discover key correlations among these characteristics, e.g., normal mobile users are highly correlated with using the front camera and with the presence of a face, whereas misbehaving mobile users have a high negative correlation with the presence of a face.},

 abstract = {Mobile phones have evolved from communication devices to indispensable accessories with access to real-time content. The increasing reliance on dynamic content comes at the cost of increased latency to pull the content from the Internet before the user can start using it. While prior work has explored parts of this problem, they ignore the bandwidth costs of prefetching, incur significant training overhead, need several sensors to be turned on, and do not consider practical systems issues that arise from the limited background processing capability supported by mobile operating systems. In this paper, we make app prefetch practical on mobile phones. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we design an app prediction algorithm, APPM, that requires no prior training, adapts to usage dynamics, predicts not only which app will be used next but also when it will be used, and provides high accuracy without requiring additional sensor context. Second, we perform parallel prefetch on screen unlock, a mechanism that leverages the benefits of prediction while operating within the constraints of mobile operating systems. Our experiments are conducted on long-term traces, live deployments on the Android Play Market, and user studies, and show that we outperform prior approaches to predicting app usage, while also providing practical ways to prefetch application content on mobile phones.},

Despite the rapid evolution in their capabilities, controlling peripherals such as network printers directly from smart devices is still in the primitive stage due to the lack of dedicated drivers. We propose and prototype a cloud-powered, driver-less printing system called CloudBridge for ubiquitous printing support from off the shelf smart devices. The CloudBridge service, which runs on a smart device, operates as a communication bridge connecting a network printer and a cloud server. By using cloud's ability to translate the operation commands into a language that the printer can understand, it is possible for a smart device to control the printer without having dedicated drivers. CloudBridge achieves the true meaning of ubiquitous mobile printing: it does not require any prerequisite settings. Compared to most widely used mobile printing solutions, the operation time is reasonable, compensating for the time and effort required for setting up the solution. CloudBridge is further optimized to improve the quality of experience, such as response time and energy consumption of the smart device, by adopting an adaptive compression method.},

Telecare services such as remote monitoring systems are now coming onto the consumer market but there is little knowledge of the impact these technologies may have on relationships between family members and older relatives. We present findings from a live field trial of SHel--a telecare system that allows nominated caregivers to remotely monitor activities--in 17 older adult's homes. Interviews were conducted with the 17 older participants and 11 of their nominated caregivers before, during and after using the system. We establish that such technologies transform existing hidden care routines between family members into care work, and the impact they have upon the sense of independence and privacy of those who are being monitored in their home.},

Through three studies-two on MTurk and one field study-we found that users are good, but make systematic errors at answering autobiographical questions. Using Bayesian modeling to account for these systematic response errors, we derived a formula for computing a confidence rating that the attempting authenticator is the user from a sequence of question-answer responses. We tested our formula against five simulated adversaries based on plausible real-life counterparts. Our simulations indicate that our model of autobiographical authentication generally performs well in assigning high confidence estimates to the user and low confidence estimates to impersonating adversaries.},

 abstract = {Based on an 18-month qualitative study that included the creation and testing of design considerations and a prototype location-based information system (LBIS), this research provides empirical insight into the daily practices of a wide variety of individuals working to address food insecurity in one U.S. county. Qualitative fieldwork reveals that nonprofit organizations in the food assistance ecology engage in location-based information practices that could be enhanced by the design of a LBIS. Two practices that would benefit from a collaborative LBIS are 1) practices of matching in which nonprofit workers help individuals who are seeking assistance to food resources and 2) practices of distribution in which nonprofit workers help organizations access and deliver food resources to clients. In order to support such practices across organizations the cooperative design component of this research suggests that an LIBS should: support the role of intermediaries who engage in practices of matching and distribution; provide interactive mapping tools that match resources to need; enable organizations to control visibility over specific data; and document work and impact. This research further suggests that designers should explore the wide variety of spatial patterns that must align and overlap such that ecologies of nonprofit organizations might synergistically work together to address pressing social needs.},

It remains an open problem, however, to incorporate haptic feedback into such interaction. In this work, we explore the use of air vortex rings for this purpose. Unlike standard jets of air, which are turbulent and dissipate quickly, vortex rings can be focused to travel several meters and impart perceptible feedback. In this paper, we review vortex formation theory and explore specific design parameters that allow us to generate vortices capable of imparting haptic feedback. Applying this theory, we developed a prototype system called AirWave. We show through objective meas urements that AirWave can achieve spatial resolution of less than 10 cm at a distance of 2.5 meters. We further demonstrate through a user study that this can be used to direct tactile stimuli to different regions of the human body.},

Knowledge of indoor floorplans is often required by these applications. However, indoor floorplans are either unavailable or obtaining them requires slow, tedious, and error-prone manual labor. This paper describes an automatic indoor floorplan construction system. Leveraging Wi-Fi fingerprints and user motion information, this system automatically constructs floorplan via three key steps: (1) room adjacency graph construction to determine which rooms are adjacent; (2) hallway layout learning to estimate room sizes and order rooms along each hallway, and (3) force directed dilation to adjust room sizes and optimize the overall floorplan accuracy. Deployment study in three buildings with 189 rooms demonstrates high floorplan accuracy. The system has been implemented as a mobile middleware, which allows emerging mobile applications to generate, leverage, and share indoor floorplans.},

In this paper, we study the effect of ESM design choices on the inferences that can be made from participants' sensor data, and on the variance in survey responses that can be collected. In particular, we answer the question: are the behavioural inferences that a researcher makes with a trigger-defined subsample of sensor data biased by the sampling strategy's design? We demonstrate that different single-sensor sampling strategies will result in what we refer to as contextual dissonance: a disagreement in how much different behaviours are represented in the aggregated sensor data. These results are not only relevant to researchers who use the ESM, but call for future work into strategies that may alleviate the biases that we measure.},

However, there is growing evidence of problematic use of smartphones that impacts both social and heath aspects of users' lives. Currently, assessment of overuse or problematic use depends on one-time, self-reported behavioral information about phone use. Due to the known issues with self-reports in such types of assessments, we explore an automated, objective and repeatable approach for assessing problematic usage. We collect a wide range of phone usage data from smartphones, identify a number of usage features that are relevant to this assessment, and build detection models based on Adaboost with machine learning algorithms automatically detecting problematic use. We found that the number of apps used per day, the ratio of SMSs to calls, the number of event-initiated sessions, the number of apps used per event initiated session, and the length of non-event-initiated sessions are useful for detecting problematic usage. With these, a detection model can identify users with problematic usage with 89.6% accuracy (F-score of .707).},

 abstract = {Several algorithms to predict the next place visited by a user have been proposed in the literature. The accuracy of these algorithms -- measured as the ratio of the number of correct predictions and the number of all computed predictions -- is typically very high. In this paper, we show that this good performance is due to the high predictability intrinsic in human mobility. We also show that most algorithms fail to correctly predict transitions, i.e. situations in which users move between different places. To this end, we analyze the performance of 18 prediction algorithms focusing on their ability to predict transitions. We run our analysis on a data set of mobility traces of 37 users collected over a period of 1.5 years. Our results show that even algorithms achieving an overall high accuracy are unable to reliably predict the next location of the user if this is different from the current one. Building upon our analysis we then present a novel next-place prediction algorithm that can both achieve high overall accuracy and reliably predict transitions. Our approach combines all the 18 algorithms considered in our analysis and achieves its good performance at the cost of a higher computational and memory overhead.},

 abstract = {Heading information becomes widely used in ubiquitous computing applications for mobile devices. Digital magnetometers, also known as geomagnetic field sensors, provide absolute device headings relative to the earth's magnetic north. However, magnetometer readings are prone to significant errors in indoor environments due to the existence of magnetic interferences, such as from printers, walls, or metallic shelves. These errors adversely affect the performance and quality of user experience of the applications requiring device headings. In this paper, we propose Headio, a novel approach to provide reliable device headings in indoor environments. Headio achieves this by aggregating ceiling images of an indoor environment, and by using computer vision-based pattern detection techniques to provide directional references. To achieve zero-configured and energy-efficient heading sensing, Headio also utilizes multimodal sensing techniques to dynamically schedule sensing tasks. To fully evaluate the system, we implemented Headio on both Android and iOS mobile platforms, and performed comprehensive experiments in both small-scale controlled and large-scale public indoor environments. Evaluation results show that Headio constantly provides accurate heading detection performance in diverse situations, achieving better than 1 degree average heading accuracy, up to 33X improvement over existing techniques.},

 abstract = {In a mixed-methods study on adoption of location-sharing social networks (LSSN), we discovered that variations in adoption and usage behavior could be explained by one's predisposition to communicate in a certain style. Specifically, we found that certain individuals prefer a communication style we call FYI (For Your Information). FYI communicators like to infer availability and to keep in touch with others without having to interact with them, which is the predominant style in current LSSN. Using structural equation modeling on a U.S. nationwide survey (N=1021), we show how the FYI communication style predicts the adoption of LSSN while also showing a negative effect on one's desire to call someone on the phone. Moreover, we find that as age increases, FYI preference significantly decreases. In a follow-on survey (N=180), we refine the FYI construct and show that it affects users' level of disclosure and participation in social media. Furthermore, we show that it completely mediates the effect of certain Big-5 personality traits on social media participation and LSSN usage. The results suggest that to cater to a wider segment of the population, LSSN (and arguably any social media) should support an active communication style.},

In this note, we propose a novel unsupervised approach that learns from the Bluetooth (BT) sensed data recording one's dynamic proximity relations with others to identify her social circles, each of which is formed along a semantically coherent aspect. For each circle we learn its members as well as the temporal dimensions along which it is formed. Our method is innovative in that it well overcomes data sparsity by information sharing, and allows for circle overlaps which is common in reality. Experiments on real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and also show the potentials of relational mobile data in sensing personal behaviors beyond personal data.},

Accelerometers have many advantages in such settings: they are impervious to environmental noise, unobtrusive, cheap, low-powered, and their readings are specific to a single person. Our experiments show that they are surprisingly informative of different types of social actions. The social actions we address in this paper are whether a person is speaking, laughing, gesturing, drinking, or stepping. To our knowledge, this is the first work to carry out experiments on estimating social actions from conversational behavior using only a wearable accelerometer. The ability to estimate such actions using just the acceleration opens up the potential for analyzing more about social aspects of people's interactions without explicitly recording what they are saying.},

With this work, we move beyond resource conservation and draw attention to an often-neglected aspect of infrastructural work -- the work to ensure the smooth and continuous supply of resources from end users. This paper examines the ways in which people attend to electricity through what we term collective infrastructural work, i.e. people perceive electricity as a marginal concern, and yet invest time to maintain it collectively.

The framework itself reveals discursive similarities between other existing environmental discourses, enabling reflection and participation with the broader sustainability debate. It is argued that the current computing discourse on sustainability is reformist and premised in a Triple Bottom Line construction of sustainability. A radical, Quadruple Bottom Line alternative is explored as a new vista for computing research.},

We used a sinusoidal motion model to exploit the typical repetitive structure of motion exercises. A Teach-mode was used to personalize the system by training under the guidance of a therapist and deriving exercise model parameters. Subsequently, in a Train-mode, the system provides exercise feedback. We validate our approach in a validation with healthy volunteers and in an intervention study with COPD patients.

Due to their size, visibility and their technical capabilities, they offer great potential for interaction and for becoming the future displays of public spaces. To explore their potential, researchers have recently started to develop interactive applications for various media façades. Existing development tools are mostly tailored to one specific media façade in one specific setting. They usually provide limited means to incorporate interaction by a user, and the applications developed are limited to running on only one particular media façade. In this paper, we present a flexible, generalized media façade toolkit, which is capable of mimicking arbitrary media façade installations. The toolkit is capable of running interactive applications on media façades with different form factors, sizes and technical capabilities. Furthermore, it ensures application portability between different media façades and offers the possibility of providing interactivity by enabling user input with different modalities and different interaction devices.},

This paper proposes wearable projector-based gait assistance as a novel application of mobile projectors. The technical challenge is to compensate the projected image with the intended position and size during walking. To verify the concept, we developed a self-gait training assistance system that displays stride length information on the floor while the user is walking. We conducted a study with ten healthy older adults (ages: 76-91). The results show the effectiveness of visual clues in controlling stride length and elderly people's acceptance of the wearable projector device.},

Since physical load has a linear relationship with heart rate, our purpose is to estimate heart rate with a smartphone. To this end, we build heart rate prediction models which predict heart rate variation from walking data including acceleration and walking speed by machine learning. In order to track unexpected change of physical load, we focus attention on oxygen uptake which has a similar property to heart rate and devise a novel technique to estimate the oxygen uptake from acceleration and GPS data so that it is used as an input of the model. Moreover, to adapt to difference of heart rate variation among individuals, we devise techniques to optimize parameters for each profile-based category of users and to normalize heart rate to absorb individual difference. We applied the proposed method to actual walking data on various routes by different persons and confirmed that the method estimates heart rate variation with the mean error of less than 7 beat per minute.},

However, rewriting a pixelated bistable display requires substantial energy, both for communication and for setting the pixel states. This paper describes a bistable display tag that, from an energy standpoint, is capable of perpetual operation. A commercial off-the-shelf NFC-enabled phone generates RF signals carrying both the information and energy necessary to update the display. After the update is complete, the display continues to present the information with no further power input.

We conducted interviews with 23 participants, ten of whom also participated in a three-week diary study. Our findings show that while the Nest was well-received overall, the intelligent features of the Nest were not perceived to be as useful or intuitive as expected, in particular due to the system's inability to understand the intent behind sensed behavior and users' difficulty in understanding how the Nest works. A number of participants developed workarounds for the shortcomings they encountered.

In this paper, we seek to understand home-based health monitoring practices to better design and integrate them into people's everyday life. We perform an analysis of socio-technical complexities in home-based healthcare technologies through three case studies of self-monitoring: 1) pre-eclampsia (i.e. pregnancy poisoning), 2) heart conditions, and 3) preventive care. Through the analysis seven themes emerged (people, resources, places, routines, knowledge, control and motivation) that can facilitate the understanding of home-based healthcare activities.

 abstract = {Following Bell and Dourish's call for a "ubicomp of the present," we visited 14 households in Korea, where Weiser's dreams come true, to study their social dynamics and domestic technologies as a part of these dynamics. We used a participatory research approach in which participants, acting as collaborative ethnographers and co-designers, chose how to describe their homes to us and which existing technologies to discuss. A qualitative analysis of the conversations identified two main themes. The first finding is the highly gendered nature of roles in the Korean home, influenced by traditional Confucian values and reinforced by contemporary neo-liberal norms. The second finding is that domestic technologies are used, adopted, and imagined in the context of these gendered social dynamics rather than just according to functional needs. In conclusion, we emphasize the need to attend to the social dynamics of the home in the design of politically sensitive domestic technologies, which will enable the inclusion of marginalized voices, such as women, in design.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in GPS and WiFi-based positioning technologies for mobile phones have triggered many location-based services. However, GPS positioning quickly drains a phone's battery and cannot be used indoors. On the other hand, WiFi positioning provides energy-efficient indoor and outdoor positioning with reasonable accuracy. However, WiFi positioning sometimes makes large errors caused by various reasons, e.g., the movement of reference WiFi access points. In this paper we attempt to detect and correct such errors automatically by performing outlier detection in time series. So, we solve this problem by comparing a user's current measurement at time T with her coordinate point at time T predicted from her past coordinate history, and judging whether the current measurement is correct or not by computing the distance between the measurement location and the predicted location. However, it is difficult to predict the user's coordinates accurately with a single prediction method (predictor) because the user's context (e.g., migration speed and sparseness of past coordinates) greatly affects predictor performance. We thus design a context-aware error detection method by employing an ensemble of predictors that have different strengths and weaknesses.},

 abstract = {Reducing the large energy consumption of temperature regulation systems is a challenge for researchers and practitioners alike. In this paper, we explore and compare two common types of solutions: A manual systems that encourages reduced energy use, and an intelligent automatic control system. We deployed an eco-feedback system with the ability to remotely control one's thermostat to ten participants for three months. Participants appreciated the ability to remotely control the thermostat, and controlled their heating system with 78.8% accuracy, a 6.3% improvement over not having this system. However, despite having feedback and remote control, they still wasted a lot of energy heating when away from home for the day. Using data from our deployment, we developed TherML, an occupancy prediction algorithm that uses GPS data from a user's smartphone to automatically control the indoor temperature of a home with 92.1% accuracy. We compare TherML to other state-of-the-art techniques, and show that the higher accuracy of our approach optimizes both energy usage and user comfort. We end with recommendations for a mixed initiative system that leverages aspects of both the manual and automated approaches that can better match heating control to users' routines and preferences.},

However, recent research has indicated that current mobile apps suffer from poor implementations of web caching. In this work, we first conducted a comprehensive survey of over 1000 Android apps to identify how different types of mobile apps perform in web caching. Based on our analysis, we designed CacheKeeper, an OS web caching service transparent to mobile apps for smartphones. CacheKeeper can not only effectively reduce overhead caused by poor web caching of mobile apps, but also utilizes cross-app caching opportunities in smartphones. Furthermore, CacheKeeper is backward compatible, meaning that existing apps can take advantage of CacheKeeper without any modifications. We have implemented a prototype of CacheKeeper in Linux kernel. Evaluation on 10 top ranked Android apps shows that our CacheKeeper prototype can save 42% networks traffic with real user browsing behaviors and increase web accessing speed by 2x under real 3G settings. Experiments also show that our prototype incurs negligible overhead in most aspects on cache misses.},

Examples range from acoustic signatures of laughter to detect which scenes were funny, to the stillness of the tablet indicating intense drama. Moreover, unlike in most conventional systems, these ratings need not result in just one numeric score, but could be expanded to capture the user's experience. We combine these ideas into an Android based prototype called Pulse, and test it with 11 users each of whom watched 4 to 6 movies on Samsung tablets. Encouraging results show consistent correlation between the user's actual ratings and those generated by the system. With more rigorous testing and optimization, Pulse could be a candidate for real-world adoption.},

These include a novel approach to interactive modification of fine grained step data, allowing people to remove private data and using motif discovery to generate realistic replacement data. Finally, we conduct semi structured interviews with 12 participants examining these scenarios and transformations.

 abstract = {Searching for misplaced keys, phones, or wallets is a common nuisance. Find My Stuff (FiMS) provides search support for physical objects inside furniture, on room level, and in multiple locations, e.g., home and office. Stuff tags make objects searchable while all other localization components are integrated into furniture. FiMS requires minimal configuration and automatically adapts to the user's furniture arrangement. Object search is supported with relative position cues, such as "phone is inside top drawer" or "the wallet is between couch and table," which do not require exact object localization. Functional evaluation of our prototype shows the approach's practicality with sufficient accuracy in realistic environments and low energy consumption. We also conducted two user studies, which showed that objects can be retrieved significantly faster with FiMS than manual search and that our relative position cues provide better support than map-based cues. Combined with audiovisual feedback, FiMS also outperforms spotlight-based cues.},

We present Pursuits, an innovative interaction technique that enables truly spontaneous interaction with eye-based interfaces. A user can simply walk up to the screen and readily interact with moving targets. Instead of being based on gaze location, Pursuits correlates eye pursuit movements with objects dynamically moving on the interface. We evaluate the influence of target speed, number and trajectory and develop guidelines for designing Pursuits-based interfaces. We then describe six realistic usage scenarios and implement three of them to evaluate the method in a usability study and a field study. Our results show that Pursuits is a versatile and robust technique and that users can interact with Pursuits-based interfaces without prior knowledge or preparation phase.},

 abstract = {This paper presents iSee, a crowdsourced approach to detecting and localizing events in outdoor environments. Upon spotting an event, an iSee user only needs to swipe on her smartphone's touchscreen in the direction of the event. These swiping directions are often inaccurate and so are the compass measurements. Moreover, the swipes do not encode any notion of how far the event is located from the user, neither is the GPS location of the user accurate. Furthermore, multiple events may occur simultaneously and users do not explicitly indicate which events they are swiping towards. Nonetheless, as more users start contributing data, we show that our proposed system is able to quickly detect and estimate the locations of the events. We have implemented iSee on Android phones and have experimented in real-world settings by planting virtual "events" in our campus and asking volunteers to swipe on seeing one. Results show that iSee performs appreciably better than established triangulation and clustering-based approaches, in terms of localization accuracy, detection coverage, and robustness to sensor noise.},

The central challenge is to create statistical recognition models that are accurate and resource-efficient in the face of the variety of natural language, while requiring little specialized knowledge from developers. We show that given a few examples from the developer, it is possible to elicit comprehensive sets of paraphrases of the examples using internet crowds. The exhaustive nature of these paraphrases allows us to use relatively simple, automatically derived statistical models for speech and language understanding that perform well without per-application tuning. We have realized our design fully as an extension to the Visual Studio IDE.

However, development of such approaches has been limited by the requirement of personal semantic labels for locations or social/spatial overlap between individuals in the group. To address this shortcoming, we present a Bayesian model of mobility in populations (i.e., groups without spatial or social interconnections) that is not subject to any of these requirements. The model intelligently shares temporal parameters between people, but keeps the spatial parameters specific to individuals. To illustrate the advantages of population modelling, we apply our model to the difficult problem of overcoming data sparsity in location prediction systems, using the Nokia dataset comprising 38 individuals, and find a factor of 2.4 improvement in location prediction performance against a state-of-the-art model when training on only 20 hours of observations.},

The system tracks the run-time I/O pattern of a smartphone that is then matched with the closest pattern from the benchmark table. After having obtained the optimal parameters, it dynamically configures storage parameters to reduce energy consumption.

Users' locations, activities and their co-presence can be shared easily with online "friends", as their smartphones already access such information from embedded sensors and storage. Yet, people usually exhibit selective sharing behavior depending on contextual attributes, thus showing that privacy, utility, and usability are paramount to the success of such online services. In this paper, we present SPISM, a novel information-sharing system that decides (semi-)automatically whether to share information with others, whenever they request it, and at what granularity. Based on active machine learning and context, SPISM adapts to each user's behavior and it predicts the level of detail for each sharing decision, without revealing any personal information to a third-party. Based on a personalized survey about information sharing involving 70 participants, our results provide insight into the most influential features behind a sharing decision. Moreover, we investigate the reasons for the users' decisions and their confidence in them. We show that SPISM outperforms other kinds of global and individual policies, by achieving up to 90% of correct decisions.},

However, calibration is often viewed as a tedious necessity of a purely technical nature. In this paper we argue that calibration can be used as a valuable and informative step for users molding a technology for their own use. We explain this through two case studies that use body sensing technologies to teach physical skills. Our studies show that calibration can be used by teachers and pupils to set goals. We argue that demystifying calibration and designing to expose the intentions of the technology and its functioning can be beneficial for users, allowing them to shape technology to be in tune with their bodies rather than changing their body to fit the technology.},

This map is usually built manually by a person holding the mapping device, which results in orientation-dependent fingerprints due to signal attenuation by the human body. To offset this distortion, fingerprints are typically collected for multiple orientations, but this requires a high effort for large localization areas. In this paper, we propose an approach to reduce the mapping effort by modeling the WLAN signal attenuation caused by the human body. By applying the model to the captured signal to compensate for the attenuation, it is possible to generate an orientation-independent fingerprint. We demonstrate that our model is location and person independent and its output is comparable with manually created radio maps. By using the model, the WLAN scanning effort can be reduced by 75% to 87.5% (depending on the number of orientations).},

@proceedings{Mattern:2013:2493432,
 abstract = {Welcome to the proceedings of the 2013 ACM Joint International Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp 2013) -- the first proceedings after the merger of the two most prestigious conferences in the field of Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing. We were very happy to receive a record number of submissions for this inaugural edition: 305 full papers and 89 notes, for a total of 394 submissions. This is almost exactly the number of submission that the two individual conferences received in 2011 combined! We take this as a sign of strong support from the community, and hope that our efforts of creating an exciting, high quality program this year will ensure that future editions will continue this growth. We had three aims in this year's edition: to further grow the community with the help of an inclusive program; to maintain the high quality of the constituting conference series Pervasive and UbiComp; and to ensure our review processes could handle the expected growth. Previously, both Pervasive and UbiComp had average acceptance rates of well below 20% (averaging 17% and 16% in the last 8 years, respectively). We believe that consistently rejecting some 85% of all submitted work does not help with maintaining a healthy and vibrant community. We thus took a cue from the updated submission processes at other premium conference series, such as the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW), and introduced a new "revise & resubmit" decision as part of the Program Committee (PC) meeting outcome. "Revise & resubmit" roughly corresponded to the decision "Major Revision Required" in a journal review process: the authors received a detailed set of reviews, along with an editorial "meta review" outlining core issues that needed to be addressed in order to have a chance at being accepted in a second review round. Four weeks later, the original set of PC members who discussed the submission at the PC meeting got together in an online meeting to evaluate the quality of the revised paper. In case all conditions were met, the paper was accepted. Given the novelty of this process, the Program Committee was relatively cautious with inviting authors for a resubmission. Out of the 394 submission, 71 were accepted or conditionally accepted at the PC meeting, while an additional 34 submissions (8.6% of the total) were invited to revise and resubmit. They were given a concrete list of issues and 4 weeks' time to submit a revision. 29 revisions were received. Out of these, 22 had significantly improved and were ultimately accepted into the program, while for 7 submissions the reviewers found that -- despite the changes -- they were still not ready for publication. We thus have a total of 92 accepted submissions, which not only makes for a healthy 23.4% acceptance rate but also represents the largest program ever in the history of the two conferences -- even when combining all papers presented in a single year at both venues (cf. Figure 2). Overall, we believe that this process helped to grow the breadth and scope of the program while maintaining the high quality expected at a top-tier conference venue like UbiComp. The above description should also illustrate well the efforts undertaken by this year's Program Committee to gather, select, and improve the work submitted to the conference. This year saw not only the largest number of accepted papers, but also the largest Program Committee ever: 75 PC members, together with over 350 external experts, wrote a total of 1647 reviews in the course of the review process. After further considering each submission via an online discussion forum, 208 submissions (52.7%) were selected for discussion at the two-day face-to-face PC meeting in Paris, France, on May 3-4, 2013. Each of us three PC Chairs moderated a group of roughly 25 PC members, working mostly in parallel but repeatedly synchronizing and calibrating in plenary sessions -- also thanks to the continuing "exchange" of PC members across groups. The parallel sessions saw a frenzy of activity, as additional experts were constantly being drafted from the various meeting rooms by a helpful staff of 6 student volunteers, in order to provide additional input on particular paper discussions elsewhere -- all coordinated by a huge schedule spreadsheet that would consider both conflicts of interests and reviewer availability across all three groups. The amount of expertise and community-history represented by the 70+ PC members present at the meeting was truly invigorating.},

The main contributions in this paper include the presentation of a novel clinical study of cocaine use, the development of a computational pipeline for inferring morphological features from noisy ECG waveforms, and the evaluation of feature sets for cocaine use detection.

To update positions on location servers, position update protocols are used. On the one hand, these protocols decide when an update has to be sent to ensure a certain quality of position information. On the other hand, they try to minimize the energy consumption of the mobile device by reducing communication to a minimum. In this paper, we show how to improve the energy efficiency of different update protocols by taking the energy characteristics of the mobile network interface into account. In particular, we show that the energy consumption can be reduced on average by 70% using an opportunistic update strategy sending position updates together with messages of other applications.

 abstract = {This study is the first attempt to investigate altruistic use of interactive public displays in natural usage settings as a crowdsourcing mechanism. We test a non-paid crowdsourcing service on public displays with eight different motivation settings and analyse users' behavioural patterns and crowdsourcing performance (e.g., accuracy, time spent, tasks completed). The results show that altruistic use, such as for crowdsourcing, is feasible on public displays, and through the controlled use of motivational design and validation check mechanisms, performance can be improved. The results shed insights on three research challenges in the field: i) how does crowdsourcing performance on public displays compare to that of online crowdsourcing, ii) how to improve the quality of feedback collected from public displays which tends to be noisy, and iii) identify users' behavioural patterns towards crowdsourcing on public displays in natural usage settings.},

It utilizes the already embedded audio hardware in smart devices to determine if a particular device is being pointed at by another device (i.e., the user waves their mobile phone at a target in a pointing motion). We evaluate the accuracy of DopLink in a controlled user study, showing that, within 3 meters, it has an average accuracy of 95% for device selection and 97% for finding relative device position. Finally, we show three applications of DopLink: rapid device pairing, home automation, and multi-display synchronization.},

We propose a semantic attribute sequence model that takes into account both the hierarchical and sequential nature of activity data. Evaluation on datasets in two activity domains show that the proposed zero-shot learning approach achieves 70-75% precision and recall recognizing unseen new activities, and outperforms supervised learning with limited labeled data for the new classes.},

In this paper, we propose SEALs - a fine-grained preference-aware location search framework leveraging the crowdsourced traces in LBSNs. We first collect user check-ins and tips from Foursquare and use them as direct user feedback on locations. Second, we extract users' sentiment about locations and associated entities from tips to characterize their fine-grained location preference. Third, we incorporate such fine-grained user preference into personalized location ranking using tensor factorization techniques.

Current advanced estimators use a context-dependent approach in which a different regression model is invoked for different activities of the user. In this paper, we go a step further and use multiple contexts corresponding to multiple sensors, resulting in an ensemble of models for energy expenditure estimation. This provides a multi-view perspective, which leads to a better estimation of the energy.

The importance of this topic will only increase as urbanization continues around the world. A less researched aspect of transportation is the refueling behavior of drivers. In this paper, we propose a step toward real-time sensing of refueling behavior and citywide petrol consumption. We use reported trajectories from a fleet of GPS-equipped taxicabs to detect gas station visits, measure the time spent, and estimate overall demand. For times and stations with sparse data, we use collaborative filtering to estimate conditions. Our system provides real-time estimates of gas stations' waiting times, from which recommendations could be made, an indicator of overall gas usage, from which macro-scale economic decisions could be made, and a geographic view of the efficiency of gas station placement.},

We envision Focus being especially useful during low battery situations when usability is less important than power savings. We tested Focus using 15 applications running on a Samsung Galaxy S III and show that it saves, on average, between 23 to 34% of the OLED display power with little impact on task completion times.

Deployed products often compute semantic labels with heuristics, which are difficult to program reliably. In this paper, we develop Placer, an algorithm to infer semantic places labels. It uses data from two large, government diary studies to create a principled algorithm for labeling places based on machine learning. Our labeling reduces to a classification problem, where we classify locations into different label categories based on individual demographics, the timing of visits, and nearby businesses. Using these government studies gives us an unprecedented amount of training and test data. For instance, one of our experiments used training data from 87,600 place visits (from 10,372 distinct people) evaluated on 1,135,053 visits (from 124,517 distinct people). We show labeling accuracy for a number of experiments, including one that gives a 14 percentage point increase in accuracy when labeling is a function of nearby businesses in addition to demographic and time features. We also test on GPS data from 28 subjects.},

An opportunity exists to impact public health by re-considering this pervasive interface. Toward that end, we investigated the correspondence between consumers' perceptions of weight data and the realities of weight fluctuation. Through an analysis of online product reviews, a journaling study on weight fluctuations, expert interviews, and a large-scale survey of scale users, we found that consumers' perception of weight scale behavior is often disconnected from scales' capabilities and from clinical relevance, and that accurate understanding of weight fluctuation is associated with greater trust in the scale itself. We propose significant changes to how weight data should be presented and discuss broader implications for the design of other ubiquitous health sensing devices.},

In this paper we have identified a set of activities, which are linked to behaviour traits that are relevant for a dog's wellbeing.

In an experimental evaluation we analysed the naturalistic behaviour of 18 dogs and were able to recognise a total of 17 different activities with approximately 70% classification accuracy. The presented system is the first of its kind that allows for robust and detailed analysis of dog activities in naturalistic environments.},

Such location traces are a rich source of information and can be used for congestion pricing, taxicab placement, and improved city planning. An important problem to enable these application is to identify human mobility patterns from the taxicab traces, which translates to being able to identify pickup and dropoff points for a particular trip. In this paper, we show that while past approaches are effective in detecting hotspots using location traces, they are largely ineffective in identifying trips (pairs of pickup and dropoff points). We propose the use of a graph theory concept - stretch factor in a novel manner to identify trip(s) made by a taxicab and show that a Hidden Markov Model based algorithm can identify trips (using real datasets from taxicab deployments in Shanghai and partially simulated datasets from Stockholm) with precision and recall of 90-94%, a significant improvement over past approaches that result in a precision and recall of about 50-60%.},
