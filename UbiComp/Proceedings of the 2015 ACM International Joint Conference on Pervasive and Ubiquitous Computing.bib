 abstract = {Trigger-action programming is a simple programming model that enables users to create rules that automate behavior of smart homes, devices, and online services. Existing trigger-action programming systems, such as if-this-then-that (IFTTT), already have millions of users worldwide; however, their oversimplification limits the expressivity of the programs that can be created. While extensions of IFTTT to allow more complex programs have been proposed, previous work neglects a key distinction between different trigger types (states and events) and action types (instantaneous, extended, and sustained actions). In this paper, we systematically study the impact of these differences through two user studies that reveal: (i) inconsistencies in interpreting the behavior of trigger-action programs and (ii) errors made in creating programs with a desired behavior. Based on a characterization of these issues, we offer recommendations for improving the IFTTT interface so as to mitigate issues that arise from mental model inaccuracies.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in materials science have resulted in a range of commercially viable and easy-to-use conductive inks which novices, hobbyists, educators, students and researchers are now using to design and build interactive circuits quickly. Despite the ease with which practitioners can construct working circuits, one of the major limitations of designing circuits on-the-fly is the difficulty of detecting and understanding errors in prototype circuits. As well as short- and open-circuits, which often prevent a circuit from working at all, more subtle issues like high resistance traces can result in poor performance. Many users can't readily work out how to successfully modify their circuits, and they often don't have the tools or expertise to measure the relevant circuit parameters. In this paper we present ConductAR, a tool which can recognize and analyze hand-drawn, printed and hybrid conductive ink patterns. An on-screen augmented reality style interaction helps users to understand and enhance circuit operation. A key element of ConductAR is its ability to calculate the resistance of a circuit using a camera attached to an off-the-shelf PC or tablet. Our sparse coding technique is fast enough to support rapid iterative prototyping on real circuits using a conductive ink marker and/or eraser as shown in Figure 1. The system thereby enhances the feasibility of circuit prototyping with conductive ink.},

However, uptake of these devices has been slow and abandonment swift, which indicates that smart devices may not currently meet the needs of users. To advance an understanding of the ways users benefit from, are challenged by, and abandon smart devices, we asked a group of users to purchase smart sensing devices to advance themselves towards a personal, self-defined goal. We found that participants abandoned devices because they did not fit with the their conceptions of themselves, the data collected by devices were perceived to not be useful, and device maintenance became unmanageable. Participants used devices because they had developed routines and because devices were useful, satisfied curiosity, and held hope for potential benefit to them. We propose ways to reduce barriers, motivate use, and argue for envisioning an additional function of these devices for short-term interventions, in addition to standard long-term use.},

Our argument is that, by engaging with repairers "[on] their own terms," technologists can expand conversations around designing for the 'developing' world that go beyond building novel smartphone applications. In fact, such conversations can also include reimagining mobile phones, and supporting local repairers' efforts to manufacture them.

 abstract = {Consumer impulsivity is a psychological feature characterizing the impulsive buying tendency. In this paper, by bridging consumer behavior with perceived stimuli on social networks, we present a computational framework, termed Consumer Impulsivity Model (CIM), for exploring a consumer's impulsivity in both offline and online context: consumption-related location visit indicating consumption patterns in the physical realm, and online shopping behavior indicating economic activities on the Internet. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CIM, we conduct extensive experiments, with a large dataset we have collected from thousands of consumers. The results show that 1) for 103 subjects, the inferred consumer impulsivity has a positive Pearson correlation with survey results in the situation of product and product category, respectively. 2) females inferred impulsivity is higher than males on average in the situation of product and product category, respectively. Age has a negative Pearson correlation with inferred impulsivity in the situation of POI, POI category and product category, respectively. 3) for next behavior prediction, our model defeats several presented baselines. These results suggest that our framework CIM offers a powerful paradigm for 1) presenting an effective measurement for consumer impulsivity. 2) uncovering the correlation between consumer impulsivity and demographic factors and 3) revealing that the introduction of impulsivity is effective in predicting consumer behavior.},

In this paper we seek to answer whether mobile phones can be used to unobtrusively monitor individuals affected by depressive mood disorders by analyzing only their mobility patterns from GPS traces. In order to get ground-truth measurements, we have developed a smartphone application that periodically collects the locations of the users and the answers to daily questionnaires that quantify their depressive mood. We demonstrate that there exists a significant correlation between mobility trace characteristics and the depressive moods.

The current administration of the test limits its usage beyond the lab environment. Creating a mobile version would facilitate ubiquitous administration of the test. Yet, the mobile design must be at least as good as its paper-based counterpart in terms of input accuracy and user interaction efforts. We developed four user interface designs, each of which featured a specific interaction approach. These approaches included displaying the 2D space of the questionnaire in its original form (M1), inputting one variable at a time on the 2D space (M2), dissolving the 2D space into two one-dimensional ordinal scales (M3), and orienting the input selections to the diagonal axes (M4). The designs were tested by a total of 34 participants, aged 18 to 52 years. The study results find the first three interaction approaches (M1-M3) effective but the fourth approach inefficient. Furthermore, the results indicate that the two-tap designs (M2 and M3) are equally as good as the one-tap design (M1).},

In this paper, we leverage the spatial and temporal correlation among the data sensed in different sub-areas to significantly reduce the required number of sensing tasks allocated (corresponding to budget), yet ensuring the data quality. Specifically, we propose a novel framework called CCS-TA, combining the state-of-the-art compressive sensing, Bayesian inference, and active learning techniques, to dynamically select a minimum number of sub-areas for sensing task allocation in each sensing cycle, while deducing the missing data of unallocated sub-areas under a probabilistic data accuracy guarantee. Evaluations on real-life temperature and air quality monitoring datasets show the effectiveness of CCS-TA. In the case of temperature monitoring, CCS-TA allocates 18.0-26.5% fewer tasks than baseline approaches, allocating tasks to only 15.5% of the sub-areas on average while keeping overall sensing error below 0.25°C in 95% of the cycles.},

Even though the accelerometer is the most widely used sensor, the highest recognition accuracies are obtained when using data collected from multiple sensors. However, the use of multiple sensors has an adverse impact on the energy consumption of power-limited devices such as smartphones. In this paper, we present a new method to improve the recognition accuracy of physical activities by using only the accelerometer. We utilize a low-pass filter to split the acceleration data into a low- and a high-frequency component. These components provide a new set of features, which can be used as a complement to the raw acceleration to reduce the number of sensors needed to recognize physical activities. After evaluating our method for a public dataset, we found that our approach represents an average of up to 16% increase in the recognition accuracy over the raw acceleration data, outperforming even widely used combinations such as the raw acceleration plus the gyroscope. The highest accuracies are obtained when using a cut-off frequency in the interval [0:001--0:05] Hz as well as a combination of the acceleration with its low-frequency component.},

 abstract = {The next generation of human activity recognition applications in ubiquitous computing scenarios focuses on assessing the quality of activities, which goes beyond mere identification of activities of interest. Objective quality assessments are often difficult to achieve, hard to quantify, and typically require domain specific background information that bias the overall judgement and limit generalisation. In this paper we propose a framework for skill assessment in activity recognition that enables automatic quality analysis of human activities. Our approach is based on a hierarchical rule induction technique that effectively abstracts from noise-prone activity data and assesses activity data at different temporal contexts. Our approach requires minimal domain specific knowledge about the activities of interest, which makes it largely generalisable. By means of an extensive case study we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the context of dexterity training of 15 medical students engaging in 50 attempts of surgical activities.},

SymDetector uses the built-in microphone on the smartphone to continuously monitor a user's acoustic data and uses multi-level processes to detect and classify the respiratory symptoms. Several practical issues are considered in developing SymDetector, such as users' privacy concerns about their acoustic data, resource constraints of the smartphone and different contexts of the smartphone. We have implemented SymDetector on Galaxy S3 and evaluated its performance in real experiments involving 16 users and 204 days. The experimental results show that SymDetector can detect these four types of respiratory symptoms with high accuracy under various conditions.},

Results from visual attention analysis as well as post-hoc recall and recognition tasks on display contents reveal that visual attention is mostly on users' silhouette while peripheral screen elements remain largely unattended. In our experiment, content attached to the user representation attracted significantly more attention than other screen contents, while content placed at the top and bottom of the screen attracted significantly less.

 abstract = {Current approaches to personalization either presuppose people's needs and automatically tailor services or provide formulaic options for people to customize. We propose a complementary approach to personalization: a reflective strategy that helps people realize what matters to them and enables them to better personalize services themselves. To design this strategy, we first studied the practices of eight personal health service providers. We then tested the strategy's efficacy by building a Fitbit Plan website that encouraged Fitbit users to customize a plan or accept an automatically tailored plan. For one group of users, the website used the reflective strategy to assist in the plan setup process. A two-week between-subjects field experiment showed that the reflective strategy helped motivate users to carry out their plans, increasing their average daily steps by 2,425 steps. Without the reflective strategy, users either set easy goals or failed to carry out system-created plans, ultimately showing no change in their average daily steps. This work suggests that helping people reflect on and connect with their own goals in using a personalized service could advance the effectiveness of the service.},

 abstract = {Indoor localization is of great importance to a wide range of applications in the era of mobile computing. Current mainstream solutions rely on Received Signal Strength (RSS) of wireless signals as fingerprints to distinguish and infer locations. However, those methods suffer from fingerprint ambiguity that roots in multipath fading and temporal dynamics of wireless signals. Though pioneer efforts have resorted to motion-assisted or peer-assisted localization, they neither work in real time nor work without the help of peer users, which introduces extra costs and constraints, and thus degrades their practicality. To get over these limitations, we propose Argus, an image-assisted localization system for mobile devices. The basic idea of Argus is to extract geometric constraints from crowdsourced photos, and to reduce fingerprint ambiguity by mapping the constraints jointly against the fingerprint space. We devise techniques for photo selection, geometric constraint extraction, joint location estimation, and build a prototype that runs on commodity phones. Extensive experiments show that Argus triples the localization accuracy of classic RSS-based method, in time no longer than normal WiFi scanning, with negligible energy consumption.},

While 3D printing and open-source electronics platforms have led to enormous creativity in creating smart objects, the means for user interaction with such objects are often limited and require remote interaction through a smartphone app. Paper-based touch circuits are a convenient medium for exploring custom touch sensors that can be attached to numerous objects in our environment. The challenge lies in creating a reliable and customizable touch circuit that is easy to produce. Specifically, it should not require assembly of multiple layers and it should support multiple touch points without needing separate connections to a microcontroller for each touch point. We address this through a resistive touch sensor that exploits the inherently high resistance of printed traces to create multiple detectable touch points. The finger closes the circuit when in contact with the touch point and the sensor uses a polarity-switching technique to cancel out the effect of the unknown skin resistance. We evaluated the touch sensor using keypads with 10, 15 and 20 touch points and achieved 99.6%, 93.5%, and 91% touch detection accuracy, respectively. We also observed touch detection rates of up to 154 touches per minute.},

For example, the phone can mute and delay incoming calls when a user enters a meeting room. Cameras can be disabled in bathrooms to protect users' privacy.

Furthermore, we demonstrate data mining by applying our method to the bigger data with additional hospital data. In the proposed method, we 1) convert a set of segment timestamps into a prior probability of the activity segment by exploiting the concept of importance sampling, 2) obtain the likelihood of traditional recognition methods for each local time window within the segment range, and, 3) apply Bayesian estimation by marginalizing the conditional probability of estimating the activities for the segment samples. By evaluating with the dataset, the proposed method outperformed the traditional method without using the prior knowledge by 25.81% at maximum by balanced classification rate. Moreover, the proposed method significantly reduces duration errors of activity segments from 324.2 seconds of the traditional method to 74.6 seconds at maximum.

Accordingly, our internal circadian timings experience interference from externally determined factors such as work schedules and social engagements, and digital connectivity imports additional social constraints that can further misalign our individual body clocks. Misalignment between biological and social time causes social jet lag [50], which has serious physical and mental health consequences. It particularly impacts our sleep processes and neurobehavioral functioning. Examining the interplay between biological rhythms and technology-mediated social interactions, we find that technology may both modulate and reflect circadian rhythms. We also leverage such social-sensor data to infer sleep-related behaviors and disruptions and to analyze variations in attention, cognitive performance, and mood following (in)adequate sleep. We conclude with recommendations for designing technologies attuned to our innate biological traits.},

We show that a user-independent machine-learning model of boredom --leveraging features related to recency of communication, usage intensity, time of day, and demographics-- can infer boredom with an accuracy (AUCROC) of up to 82.9%. Results from a second field study with 16 participants suggest that people are more likely to engage with recommended content when they are bored, as inferred by our boredom-detection model. These findings enable boredom-triggered proactive recommender systems that attune their users' level of attention and need for stimulation.},

 abstract = {We offer a reflection on the technology usage for workplace quantification through an in the wild study. Using a prototype Quantified Workplace system equipped with passive and participatory sensing modalities, we collected and visualized different workplace metrics (noise, color, air quality, self reported mood, and self reported activity) in two European offices of a research organization for a period of 4 months. Next we surveyed 70 employees to understand their engagement experience with the system. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 employees in which they explained which workplace metrics are useful and why, how they engage with the system and what privacy concerns they have. Our findings suggest that sense of inclusion acts as the initial incentive for engagement which gradually translates into a habitual routine. We found that incorporation of an anonymous participatory sensing aspect into the system could lead to sustained user engagement. Compared to past studies we observed a shift in the privacy concerns, due to the trust and transparency of our prototype system. We conclude by providing a set of design principles for building future Quantified Workplace systems.},

This paper introduces MyBehavior, a smartphone application that takes a novel approach to generate deeply personalized health feedback. It combines state-of-the-art behavior tracking with algorithms that are used in recommendation systems. MyBehavior automatically learns a user's physical activity and dietary behavior and strategically suggests changes to those behaviors for a healthier lifestyle. The system uses a sequential decision making algorithm, Multi-armed Bandit, to generate suggestions that maximize calorie loss and are easy for the user to adopt. In addition, the system takes into account user's preferences to encourage adoption using the pareto-frontier algorithm. In a 14-week study, results show statistically significant increases in physical activity and decreases in food calorie when using MyBehavior compared to a control condition.},

We apply a state-of-the-art group detection algorithm to annotate such location traces with group vs. individual context, and then show that individuals vs. groups exhibit significant differences along three behavioural traits: (1) the mobility pattern, (2) the responsiveness to calls / SMSs and (3) application usage. We show that these significant differences are robust to underlying errors in the group detection technique and that the use of such group context leads to behavioural results that differ from those reported in prior popular work.},

In this paper we present a study of mobile user interruptibility with respect to notification content, its sender, and the context in which a notification is received. In a real-world study we collect around 70,000 instances of notifications from 35 users. We group notifications according to the applications that initiated them, and the social relationship between the sender and the receiver. Then, by considering both content and context information, such as the current activity of a user, we discuss the design of classifiers for learning the most opportune moment for the delivery of a notification carrying a specific type of information. Our results show that such classifiers lead to a more accurate prediction of users' interruptibility than an alternative approach based on user-defined rules of their own interruptibility.},

We do so using a large scale survey, in-depth interviews, and logs of actual data usage over time. Our findings suggest that unlike in more developed settings, when data is limited or expensive, mobile Internet users are extremely cost-conscious, and employ various strategies to optimize mobile data usage such as actively disconnecting from the mobile Internet to save data.

The sudden pressure change observed by barometers is sufficient to detect events even in presence of user mobility (e.g. climbing stairs). We study various characteristics of the pressure variation due to door events, and demonstrate that door open/close events can be recognized with an accuracy range of 99.34% -- 99.81% based on the data collected from 3 different buildings. Such a low-cost ubiquitous solution of door event detection enables many monitoring applications without any infrastructure integration, and it can also work as an augmentation to the existing expensive security systems.},

We develop a model characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, integration, and reflection as components of tracking and acting, and discuss the lapsing and potential resuming of tracking.

EVs can also be used as energy storage devices, available during certain peak hours to power a house with electricity stored during off-peak hours. Studies suggest both techniques are practical, but were based on simulated demand patterns or large commercial fleets. To investigate feasibility on a per home basis, we collected data from 15 EV homes using the Lab of Things sensing infrastructure. We evaluate a scheme that powers homes with their car battery during expensive electricity periods and then charges the battery during cheaper periods. We show an average potential savings of $10.91/month for shifting charging times, and an additional $13.58/month for powering the home from the EV, even accounting for the inefficiencies of electric conversion.},

We analysed three months of application launch logs from 165 users in naturalistic settings. Our analysis reveals distinct clusters of applications and users which share similar revisitation patterns. However, we show that much of smartphone usage on a macro-level is very similar to web browsing on desktops, and thus argue that smartphone usage is driven by innate service needs rather than technology characteristics. On the other hand, on a micro-level we identify unique characteristics in smartphone usage, and we present a rudimentary model that accounts for 92% in the variability of our smartphone use.},

Studies have usually required cumbersome sensors and human observers, making them inappropriate for use in naturalistic settings such as the home. Emerging wearable and smart home sensing devices offer the opportunity to develop new models of thermal comfort based on data collected in-situ. To explore this opportunity, we deployed a sensing system in seven homes and collected self-report data from 11 participants for four weeks. Our system captures many factors employed in previous thermal comfort research, as well as new factors (e.g., activity level, sweat level). Machine learning-based models derived from the collected data show improvement over previous techniques, however significant prediction errors remain. In analyzing these errors we identify six problems that pose challenges for inferring comfort in the wild. Based on our findings, we suggest techniques to improve future in-situ thermal comfort modeling efforts.},

In this paper, we propose a new technique that uses data from wearable wrist sensors to perform object user identification. We hypothesize that objects have unique hallmarks that are imprinted in the hand gestures of its users. By detecting the presence of an object's hallmark in the wrist sensor data, we can identify who used the object. We evaluate this concept with a smart home application: recognizing who is using an object or appliance in a multi-person home by combining smart meter data and wearables. We conduct three different studies with 10 participants: 1) a study with scripted object use 2) a study with high-level tasked activities and unscripted object use, and 3) a 5-day in-situ study. These studies indicate that our approach performs object user identification with an average accuracy of 85--90%.},

Towards addressing this challenge, we turn to the field of deep learning; an area of machine learning that has radically changed related audio modeling domains like speech recognition. In this paper, we present DeepEar -- the first mobile audio sensing framework built from coupled Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that simultaneously perform common audio sensing tasks. We train DeepEar with a large-scale dataset including unlabeled data from 168 place visits. The resulting learned model, involving 2.3M parameters, enables DeepEar to significantly increase inference robustness to background noise beyond conventional approaches present in mobile devices. Finally, we show DeepEar is feasible for smartphones by building a cloud-free DSP-based prototype that runs continuously, using only 6% of the smartphone's battery daily.},

For the live production of an entertainment show, we can rarely expect favorable conditions in an environment like a museum, cozy hall or a laboratory. Even for a live show that rallies hundreds of thousands of people or a TV program watched by more than a hundred million people, there are barriers different from those found in art and research projects---e.g. there is only one minute available for a conversion process or insufficient time for rehearsals. Therefore, there is still a very limited number of cases in which a risky system is adopted, using real-time image analyses and/or image processing. In most productions, a performer moves, adjusting to the pre-rendered images. The topics to be covered in this lecture include how the producer realizes an ideal world based on such conditions as the size of a venue or the available time for setting up, how to use image recognition, image processing techniques, control techniques, and data analysis techniques at a huge arena for a live performance or on a live broadcast program, while actual software and data used in the production process are introduced.},

 abstract = {Mobile crowdsourcing is a powerful tool for collecting data of various types. The primary bottleneck in such systems is the high burden placed on the user who must manually collect sensor data or respond in-situ to simple queries (e.g., experience sampling studies). In this work, we present Compressive CrowdSensing (CCS) -- a framework that enables compressive sensing techniques to be applied to mobile crowdsourcing scenarios. CCS enables each user to provide significantly reduced amounts of manually collected data, while still maintaining acceptable levels of overall accuracy for the target crowd-based system. Naïve applications of compressive sensing do not work well for common types of crowdsourcing data (e.g., user survey responses) because the necessary correlations that are exploited by a sparsifying base are hidden and non-trivial to identify. CCS comprises a series of novel techniques that enable such challenges to be overcome. We evaluate CCS with four representative large-scale datasets and find that it is able to outperform standard uses of compressive sensing, as well as conventional approaches to lowering the quantity of user data needed by crowd systems.},

We demonstrate that this assumption does not hold for the widely used cross-validation evaluation scheme that is typically employed both during system bootstrapping and for reporting results. We describe how the characteristics of segmented time-series data render random cross-validation a poor fit, as adjacent segments are not statistically independent. We develop an alternative approach -- meta-segmented cross validation -- that explicitly circumvents this issue and evaluate it on two data-sets. Results indicate a significant drop in performance across a variety of feature extraction and classification methods if this bias is removed, and that prolonged, repetitive activities are particularly affected.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose SakuraSensor, a participatory sensing system which automatically extracts scenic routes information from videos recorded by car-mounted smart-phones and shares the information among users in quasirealtime. As scenic routes information, we target flowering cherries along roads since the best period of flowering cherries is rather short and uncertain from year to year and from place to place. To realize SakuraSensor, we face two technical challenges: (1) how to accurately detect flowering cherries and its degree, and (2) how to efficiently find good places of flowering cherries (PoIs) using the participatory sensing technique. For the first challenge, we develop an image analysis method for detecting image pixels that belong to flowering cherries. To exclude artificial objects with similar color to flowering cherries, we also employ fractal dimension analysis to filter out unnecessary image areas. For the second challenge, we propose a method called k-stage sensing. In this method, the interval for sensing (taking a still image and applying the image analysis) by each car is dynamically shortened so that the roads near the already found PoIs are more densely sensed. We implemented SakuraSensor consisting of client-side software for iOS devices and server-side software for a cloud server and conducted experiments to travel cherry-lined roads and record videos by several cars. As a result, we confirmed that our method can identify flowering cherries at about 74 % precision and 84 % recall. We also confirmed that our k-stage sensing method could achieve the comparable PoI detection rate with half sensing times compared to a conventional method.},

Previous works on this often require a pre-calibrating the step counter with training sequence or explicit user input, which is inconvenient for practical deployment. Some assume conditional independence on successive sensor readings, which achieves unsatisfactory accuracy in complex and noisy environment. Some other works need a calibration process for RSSI measurement consistency if different devices are used for offline fingerprint collection and online location query. We propose SLAC, a fingerprint positioning framework which simultaneously localizes the target and calibrates the system. SLAC is calibration-free, and works transparently for heterogeneous devices and users. It is based on a novel formulation embedded with a specialized particle filter, where location estimations, wireless signals and user motion are jointly optimized with resultant consistent and correct model parameters. Extensive experimental trials at HKUST campus and Hong Kong International Airport further confirm that SLAC accommodates device heterogeneity, and achieves significantly lower errors compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In this paper we present the PerCCS algorithm that explores the possibility of estimating person count from CO2 sensors already integrated in everyday room air-conditioning infrastructure. PerCSS uses task-driven Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) to learn a nonnegative low-dimensional representation of the CO2 data in the preprocessing stage. This denoised CO2 acts as the predictor variable for estimating occupancy count using Ensemble Least Square Regression. We tested the algorithm to estimate 15 minutes average occupancy count from a classroom of capacity 42 and compared its performance against existing methods from the literature. PerCSS estimates occupancy with a normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.075 and outperformed our comparative methods in predicting occupancy count with 91 % and 15 % for exact occupancy estimation, when the room was unoccupied and occupied respectively, whereas the competing methods failed mostly.},

 abstract = {Location-enabled applications now permeate the mobile computing landscape. As technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Apple's iBeacon protocols begin to see widespread adoption, we will no doubt see a proliferation of indoor location enabled application experiences. While not essential to each of these applications, many will require that the location of the device be true and verifiable. In this paper, we present LocAssure, a new framework for trusted indoor location estimation. The system leverages existing technologies like BLE and iBeacons, making the solution practical and compatible with technologies that are already in use today. In this work, we describe our system, situate it within a broad location assurance taxonomy, describe the protocols that enable trusted localization in our system, and provide an analysis of early deployment and use characteristics. Through developer APIs, LocAssure can provide critical security support for a broad range of indoor location applications.},

 abstract = {Understanding people flow in a city (urban dynamics) is of great importance in urban planning, emergency management, and commercial activity. With the spread of smart devices, many studies on urban dynamics modeling with mobility logs have been conducted. It is predictive analysis, not analysis of the past, that enables various applications contributing to a more prosperous society. To deal with the non-linear effects on urban dynamics from external factors, such as day of the week, national holiday, or weather, we propose a low-rank bilinear Poisson regression model, for a novel and flexible representation of urban dynamics predictive analysis. The results obtained from an experiment with one year's worth of mobility records suggest the high prediction accuracy of the proposed model. We also introduce the following applications: regional event detection via irregularities, visualization of urban dynamics corresponding to urban demographics, and extraction of urban demographics of unknown point of interests.},

However, we know little about our everyday reading habits, quantifying them enables us to get more insights about better language skills, more effective learning and ultimately critical thinking. This paper presents a first contribution towards establishing a reading log, tracking how much reading you are doing at what time. We present an approach capable of estimating the words read by a user, evaluate it in an user independent approach over 3 experiments with 24 users over 5 different devices (e-ink reader, smartphone, tablet, paper, computer screen). We achieve an error rate as low as 5% (using a medical electrooculography system) or 15% (based on eye movements captured by optical eye tracking) over a total of 30 hours of recording. Our method works for both an optical eye tracking and an Electrooculography system. We provide first indications that the method works also on soon commercially available smart glasses.},

@inproceedings{Hu:2015:EEL:2750858.2804287,
 abstract = {This paper presents experiences with eNav, a smartphone-based vehicular GPS navigation system that has an energy-saving location sensing mode capable of drastically reducing navigation energy needs. Traditional navigation systems sample the phone's GPS at a fixed rate (usually around 1Hz), regardless of factors such as current vehicle speed and distance from the next navigation waypoint. This practice results in a large energy consumption and unnecessarily reduces the attainable length of a navigation session, if the phone is left unplugged. The paper investigates two questions. First, would drivers be willing to sacrifice some of the affordances of modern navigation systems in order to prolong battery life? Second, how much energy could be saved using straightforward alternative localization mechanisms, applied to complement GPS for vehicular navigation? According to a survey we conducted of 500 drivers, as much as 91% of drivers said they would like to have a vehicular navigation application with an energy saving mode. To meet this need, eNav exploits on-board accelerometers for approximate location sensing when the vehicle is sufficiently far from the next navigation waypoint (or is stopped). A user test-study of eNav shows that it results in roughly the same user experience as standard GPS navigation systems, while reducing navigation energy consumption by almost 80%. We conclude that drivers find an energy-saving mode on phone-based vehicular navigation applications desirable, even at the expense of some loss of functionality, and that significant savings can be achieved using straightforward location sensing mechanisms that avoid frequent GPS sampling.},

To address this we conducted two user evaluations to investigate auditory displays in automated vehicles using different types of sound cues related to the primary driving sounds: acceleration, deceleration/braking, gear changing and indicating. Our first study compared earcons, speech and auditory icons with existing vehicle sounds. Our findings suggested that earcons were an effective alternative to existing vehicle sounds for presenting information related to the primary driving task. Based on these findings a second study was conducted to further investigate earcons modulated by different sonic parameters to present primary driving sounds. We discovered that earcons containing naturally mapped sonic parameters such as pitch and timbre were as effective as existing sounds in a simulated automated vehicle.},

We propose a simple and effective architectural change of offloading scans to the Wi-Fi radio. We design and build WiScan to fully exploit the gain of scan offloading.

We compared the quantity and quality of collected data using each approach, as well as the participant experience. We found Context-Triggered approaches produced more recordings, whereas the Participatory approach produced a greater amount of data with higher completeness and precision. Moreover, while participants appreciated automated recording and reminders for convenience, they highly valued having control over what and when to record and annotate. We conclude that user burden and user control are key aspects to consider when collecting and annotating contextual data with participants, and suggest features for a future tool focused on these two aspects.},

With device-free passive indoor positioning, a wireless sensor network is used to detect the movement of a person based on the fact that RF signals transmitted between a transmitter and a receiver are affected by human movement. However, because device-free passive indoor positioning relies on machine learning techniques, we must collect labeled training data at many training points in an end user's environment. This paper proposes a method that transfers a signal strength model used for locating a person obtained in another environment (source environment) to the end user environment. With the transferred models, we can construct a positioning model for the end user environment inexpensively.

 abstract = {In mobile computing, varying access to resources makes it difficult for developers to ensure that satisfactory system response times will be maintained at all times. Wearable physiological sensors offer a way to dynamically detect user frustration in response to increased system delays. However, most prior efforts have focused on binary classifiers designed to detect the presence or absence of a task-specific stimulus. In this paper, we make two contributions. Our first contribution is in identifying the use of variable length system response delays, a universal and task-independent feature of computing, as a stimulus for driving different levels of frustration. By doing so, we are able to make our second and primary contribution, which is the development of models that predict multiple levels of user frustration from psycho-physiological responses caused by system response delays. We investigate how incorporating different sensor features, application settings, and timing constraints impact the performance of our models. We demonstrate that our models of physiological responses can be used to classify five levels of frustration in near real-time with over 80% accuracy, which is comparable to the accuracy of binary classifiers.},

We identify seven key challenges: massive volume and variety of data, complexity in identifying stressors, scalability of space, multifaceted relationship between stress and time, a need for representation at multiple granularities, inter-person variability, and limited understanding of JITAI design requirements due to its novelty. We propose four new visualizations based on one million minutes of sensor data (n=70). We evaluate our visualizations with stress researchers (n=6) to gain first insights into its usability and usefulness in JITAI design. Our results indicate that spatio-temporal visualizations help identify and explain between- and within-person variability in stress patterns and contextual visualizations enable decisions regarding the timing, content, and modality of intervention. Interestingly, a granular representation is considered informative but noise-prone; an abstract representation is the preferred starting point for designing JITAIs.},

However, incorrect skeletal muscle activation during these sports and exercises, can lead to sub-optimal performance and injury. Existing techniques are susceptible to motion artifacts, particularly when used in high motion sports (e.g. jumping, cycling, etc.). They require limited body movement, or experts to manually interpret results, making them unsuitable in sports scenarios. This paper presents MyoVibe, a wearable system for determining muscle activation in high motion exercise scenarios. MyoVibe senses muscle vibration signals obtained from a wearable network of accelerometers to determine muscle activation. By modeling the characteristics of muscles and high motion noise using extreme value analysis, MyoVibe can reduce noise due to high mobility exercises. Our system can predict muscle activation with greater than 97% accuracy in isometric low motion exercise cases, up to 90% accuracy in high motion exercises.},

In this paper, we propose a home occupant tracking system that uses a smartphone and an off-the-shelf smartwatch without additional infrastructure. In our system, activity fingerprints are automatically generated from the microphone and the inertial sensors of the smartwatch, and location information is periodically obtained from the smartphone. We designed a hidden Markov model using the relationship between home activities and the room's location.

 abstract = {Understanding crowd dynamics of large-scale events is crucial to deliver a pleasant experience for the participants. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid participatory sensing approach to capture large group dynamics. Specifically, our approach is based on distributing a large number of tiny, wearable Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags and few smartphones among the group members. We start by identifying the best configuration; in terms of transmit power and beaconing interval; for detecting BLE tags in indoor and outdoor environments. Then, as a case study, we deploy the system during the six main days of the Hajj pilgrimage in 2014, which is the world's largest annual religious gathering. We used the proposed hybrid participatory approach to collect the mobility data of pilgrim groups based on GPS location and co-occurring BLE tag detections. Our system provided up to 80% group-wise detectability in a single scan event. Moreover, 98% cumulative unique tags detectability is achieved in the whole event, leading to 0.74 million records. Analysis of the group dynamics revealed unexpected behavior and interesting findings. In particular, regional variations are found among different groups in the entry or exit times, duration of stay, and group cohesion; which are attributed to congestion, improper arrangements, or the nature of activities. Furthermore, we show sub-community clusters could be identified revealing clear biases based on the demographic characteristics. Based on this case study, we also give suggestions on using the proposed system for other large-scale events.},

 abstract = {Human movements are difficult to predict, especially, when we consider rare behaviors that deviate from normal daily routines. By tracing the behavior of a person over a long period, we can model their daily routines and predict periodical behaviors, whereas rare behaviors, such as participating in the New Year's Eve countdown, can hardly be predicted readily and thus they have usually been treated as outliers of the daily routines in most existing studies. However, for scenarios such as emergency management or intelligent traffic regulation, we are more interested in rare behaviors than daily routines. Using human mobility Big Data, the rare behavior of each individual in a social crowd is no longer rare and thus it may be predicted when we analyze the crowd behavior at a citywide level. Therefore in this study, instead of predicting movement based on daily routines, we make short-term predictions based on the recent movement observations. We propose a novel model called CityMomentum as a predicting-by-clustering framework for sampling future movement using a mixture of multiple random Markov chains, each of which is a Naive Movement Predictive model trained with the movements of the subjects that belong to each cluster. We apply our approach to a big mobile phone GPS log dataset and predict the short-term future movements, especially during the Comiket 80 and New Year's Eve celebration. We evaluate our prediction by a Earth Mover Distance (EMD) based metric, and show our approach accurately predicts the crowd behavior during the rare crowd events, which makes an early crowd event warning and regulation possible in the emergent situations.},

By asking the user to perform the generated gesture, a secure channel can be authenticated. Results from a controlled user experiment (N = 13 participants, 1022 trials) demonstrate the feasibility of our technique, showing over 90% success rate in establishing a secure communication channel despite relying on complex gesture patterns. The authentication times of our method are over three-folds faster than with previous gesture-based solutions. The average execution time of a gesture is 5:7 seconds in our study, which is comparable to the input time of conventional text input based PIN authentication.

 abstract = {Mobile devices with both WLAN adapter and cellular capability, which are also known as dual-mode mobile terminals, are facing various challenges and problems in conventional WLAN discovery mechanisms, including inefficiency in network discovery, unavoidable energy consumption for frequent WLAN scanning, and privacy information leaking in network probing. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called WISDOM (Wireless Indicator Supervised Data Offloading Manipulation), which can efficiently predict the availability of appropriate WLAN access points (APs) for mobile device without the need of turning on its WLAN adapter in advance. WISDOM takes advantage of historical cellular fingerprints (i.e., the pairs of Cell-ID and Received Signal Strength Indicator) to directly model the WLAN coverage, and perform WLAN availability prediction based on the models given a query cellular fingerprint. Similarity and Classification methods are introduced to work in the framework as prediction methods. We have developed a WISDOM prototype and performed simulation and real field tests under various situations. The results showed WISDOM along with the proposed predication methods could reach at least an average of 80% in accuracy and saving 60% of power consumption on average for mobile devices.},

 abstract = {Given the penetration of mobile devices equipped with cameras, there has been increasing interest in enabling user interaction via visual codes. Simple examples like QR Codes abound. Since many codes like QR Codes are visually intrusive, various mechanisms have been explored to design visual codes that can be hidden inside regular images or videos, though the capacity of these codes remains low to ensure invisibility. We argue, however, that high capacity while maintaining invisibility would enable a vast range of applications that embed rich contextual information in video screens. To this end, we propose ImplicitCode, a high-rate visual codes that can be hidden inside regular videos. Our scheme combines existing techniques to achieve invisibility. However, we show that these techniques, when employed individually, are too constraining to deliver a high capacity. Experiment results show that ImplicitCode can deliver a significant capacity boost over two recent schemes, up to 12x that of HiLight [19] and 6x or 7x that of InFrame [32], while maintaining a similar or better level of invisibility.},

Based on extensive collection of data from 7 households including over 75,000 miles of daily EV use, home electricity consumption and generation, and in-depth interviews with householders we develop a detailed understanding of what drives EV decisions in households, quantify to what extent our participating households currently power their EVs with solar electricity, and investigate how feasible the vision of "self-sustaining electric mobility" is.

 abstract = {Even though mobile devices are ubiquitous, the conceptually simple endeavor of using co-located devices for multi-user experiences is cumbersome. It may not even be possible when certain apps are not widely available. We introduce Prime, a thin-client framework for co-located multi-device apps (MDAs). It leverages well-established remote display protocols to enable spontaneous use of MDAs. One device acts as a host, executing the app on behalf of connected clients. The key challenges is dynamic scalability: providing high framerates, low latency and fairness across clients. Therefore, we have developed: an online scheduling algorithm that provides frame rate, latency and fairness guarantees; a modified 802.11 MAC protocol that provides low-latency and fairness; and an efficient video encoder pipeline that offers up to fourteen times higher framerates. We show that Prime can scale a host up to seven concurrent players for a commercially released open source action game, achieving touch-to-pixel latency below 100ms for all clients.},

 abstract = {Bike sharing systems have been deployed in many cities to promote green transportation and a healthy lifestyle. One of the key factors for maximizing the utility of such systems is placing bike stations at locations that can best meet users' trip demand. Traditionally, urban planners rely on dedicated surveys to understand the local bike trip demand, which is costly in time and labor, especially when they need to compare many possible places. In this paper, we formulate the bike station placement issue as a bike trip demand prediction problem. We propose a semi-supervised feature selection method to extract customized features from the highly variant, heterogeneous urban open data to predict bike trip demand. Evaluation using real-world open data from Washington, D.C. and Hangzhou shows that our method can be applied to different cities to effectively recommend places with higher potential bike trip demand for placing future bike stations.},

Both stationary and wearable systems have been introduced to facilitate this task. Existing stationary systems are not scalable because of the high cost and wearable systems have issues being accepted by the workers. In this paper, we introduce a mobile camera-projector cart called OrderPickAR, which combines the benefits of both stationary and mobile systems to support order picking through Augmented Reality. Our system dynamically projects in-situ picking information into the storage system and automatically detects when a picking task is done. In a lab study, we compare our system to existing approaches, i.e, Pick-by-Paper, Pick-by-Voice, and Pick-by-Vision. The results show that using the proposed system, order picking is almost twice as fast as other approaches, the error rate is decreased up to 9 times, and mental demands are reduced up to 50%.},

 abstract = {In today's ubiquitous computing environment where users carry, manipulate, and interact with an increasing number of networked devices, applications and web services, human attention is the new bottleneck in computing. It is therefore important to minimize a user's mental effort due to notifications, especially in situations where users are mobile and using multiple wearable and mobile devices. To this end, we propose Attelia II, a novel middleware that identifies breakpoints in users' lives while using those devices, and delivers notifications at these moments. Attelia II works in real-time and uses only the mobile and wearable devices that users naturally use and wear, without any modifications to applications, and without any dedicated psycho-physiological sensors. Our in-the-wild evaluation in users' multi-device environment (smart phones and smart watches) with 41 participants for 1 month validated the effectiveness of Attelia. Our new physical activity-based breakpoint detection, in addition to the UI Event-based breakpoint detection, resulted in a 71.8% greater reduction of users' perception of workload, compared with our previous system that used UI events only. Adding this functionality to a smart watch reduced workload perception by 19.4% compared to random timing of notification deliveries. Our multi-device breakpoint detection across smart phones and watches resulted in about 3 times greater reduction in workload perception than our previous system.},

One methodological question that arises in this research context is the problem of reliable measurement to study predictors of deceptive location disclosure from usage data. In this note, we propose a simple experience sampling method (ESM) approach that is useful for studying this phenomenon. We describe our ESM deployment and report the results of a long term, quantitative study of 204 foursquare users over 1 year. Results indicate that physical distance, tie strength and order of visibility on the foursquare feed are significant predictors (with moderate to high effect sizes) of deceptive location disclosure. We connect these findings to the rich tradition of location disclosure behavior research in ubiquitous computing.},

 abstract = {As one of the most popular exercises, running is accomplished through a tight cooperation between the respiratory and locomotor systems. Research has suggested that a proper running rhythm -- the coordination between breathing and strides -- helps improve exercise efficiency and postpone fatigue. This paper presents RunBuddy -- the first smartphone-based system for continuous running rhythm monitoring. RunBuddy is designed to be a convenient and unobtrusive exercise feedback system, and only utilizes commodity devices including smartphone and Bluetooth headset. A key challenge in designing RunBuddy is that the sound of breathing typically has very low intensity and is susceptible to interference. To reliably measure running rhythm, we propose a novel approach that integrates ambient sensing based on accelerometer and microphone, and a physiological model called Locomotor Respiratory Coupling (LRC), which indicates possible ratios between the stride and breathing frequencies. We evaluate RunBuddy through experiments involving 13 subjects and 39 runs. Our results show that, by leveraging the LRC model, RunBuddy correctly measures the running rhythm for indoor/outdoor running 92:7% of the time. Moreover, RunBuddy also provides detailed physiological profile of running that can help users better understand their running process and improve exercise self-efficacy.},

AR systems work best if the test data contains and only contains these predefined activities. In real world applications, AR systems trained in this manner generate serious false positives, for example if "smoking" is one of the activities in the training data but "lifting weights" is not. Due to the similarity of two activities, an AR system may report a user smoking 100 times a day but he actually did a bicep workout 100 times. In this work, we propose a new approach to train an AR system leveraging the large quantity of unlabeled data which reflects activities users perform in real life. The proposed mPUL (Multi-class Positive and Unlabeled Learning) approach significantly reduces the false positives.

We focus on: 1) how vehicle-based recording and sensing may differ from perceptions of current recording; 2) factors that impact comfort with vehicle-based recording for hypothetical drivers versus bystanders; and 3) perceptions of potential privacy-preserving techniques. We find that vehicle-based recording challenges current mental models of recording awareness. Comfort tends to depend on perceived benefits, which can vary by stakeholder type. Perceived privacy in spaces near cars can also impact comfort and reflect mental models of private spaces as well as the range of potentially sensitive activities people perform in and near cars. Privacy-preserving techniques may increase perceived comfort but may require addressing trust and usability issues.},

 abstract = {We report on a 10-month in-the-wild study of the adoption, engagement and discontinuation of an activity tracker called Habito, by a sample of 256 users who installed the tracker on their own volition. We found 'readiness' to behavior change to be a strong predictor of adoption (which ranged from 56% to 20%). Among adopters, only a third updated their daily goal, which in turn impacted their physical activity levels. The use of the tracker was dominated by glances -- brief, 5-sec sessions where users called the app to check their current activity levels with no further interaction, while users displayed true lack of interest in historical data. Textual feedback proved highly effective in fueling further engagement with the tracker as well as inducing physical activity. We propose three directions for design: designing for different levels of 'readiness', designing for multilayered and playful goal setting, and designing for sustained engagement.},

However, users are uncertain about how accurately their devices track their data. In order to better understand this challenge, we analyzed 600 product reviews and conducted 24 interviews with tracking device users. In this paper, we describe what methods users used to assess accuracy of their tracking devices and identify seven problems they encountered. We found that differences in users' expectations, physical characteristics, types of activities and lifestyle led them to have different perceptions of the accuracy of their devices. With the absence of sound mental models and unclear understanding of the concepts of accuracy and experimental controls, users designed faulty tests and came to incorrect conclusions. We propose design recommendations to better support end-users' efforts to assess and improve the accuracy of their tracking devices as required to suit their individual characteristics and purposes.},

In order to be effective, many of the persuasive technologies developed so far relies on user's motivation and ability, which is highly variable and often the reason behind the failure of such technology. In this paper, we present the concept of Mindless Computing, which is a new approach to persuasive technology design. Mindless Computing leverages theories and concepts from psychology and behavioral economics into the design of technologies for behavior change. We show through a systematic review that most of the current persuasive technologies do not utilize the fast and automatic mental processes for behavioral change and there is an opportunity for persuasive technology designers to develop systems that are less reliant on user's motivation and ability. We describe two examples of mindless technologies and present pilot studies with encouraging results. Finally, we discuss design guidelines and considerations for developing this type of persuasive technology.},

 abstract = {A known challenge of designing large public interactive displays is to create an interface that attracts a passerby's attention and communicates its interactivity. However, typical "in-the-wild" field study methods of assessing public display design solutions require costly system implementation and deployment, creating challenges for assessing early stage design concepts. Such studies also limit the amount of experimental control researchers have over the environment, limiting the precision of results. To address these issues, we developed a complementary laboratory-based study methodology that employs experimental deception to assess the ability of an interface design solution to attract a passerby's attention. Our methodology enables more rigorous control of confounding factors, study of early-stage prototypes, and requires minimal setup. We used this methodology to assess existing visual design solutions for drawing attention and enticing interaction, compare our results to previous studies, and reflect on the benefits and limitations of this assessment approach.},

However, privacy concerns regarding handling of sensitive user location data potentially disrupt the adoption of such systems. This paper presents AnonyCast, a novel privacy-aware mechanism for delivering precise location information measured by crowd-tracking systems to individual pedestrians' smartphones. AnonyCast uses sparsely placed Bluetooth Low Energy transmitters to advertise location-dependent, time-varying keys. Using location measurements, AnonyCast estimates a subset of keys that each pedestrian's phone receives along its path. By combining a cryptography scheme called CP-ABE with a novel greedy algorithm for key selection, it encrypts each path before publishing, allowing users to decrypt only their own trajectories. The results from field experiments show that AnonyCast delivers accurate locations over 84% of time, bounding probability of unauthorized access to one's location below 1%.},

Despite progress over the years, most proposed approaches have been largely impractical for everyday usage, requiring multiple on-body sensors or specialized devices such as neck collars for swallow detection. In this paper, we describe the implementation and evaluation of an approach for inferring eating moments based on 3-axis accelerometry collected with a popular off-the-shelf smartwatch. Trained with data collected in a semi-controlled laboratory setting with 20 subjects, our system recognized eating moments in two free-living condition studies (7 participants, 1 day; 1 participant, 31 days), with F-scores of 76.1% (66.7% Precision, 88.8% Recall), and 71.3% (65.2% Precision, 78.6% Recall). This work represents a contribution towards the implementation of a practical, automated system for everyday food intake monitoring, with applicability in areas ranging from health research and food journaling.},

In contrast, hyperspectral imaging breaks down the electromagnetic spectrum into more narrow components and expands coverage beyond the visible spectrum. While hyperspectral imaging has proven useful as an industrial technology, its use as a sensing approach has been fragmented and largely neglected by the UbiComp community. We explore an approach to make hyperspectral imaging easier and bring it closer to the end-users. HyperCam provides a low-cost implementation of a multispectral camera and a software approach that automatically analyzes the scene and provides a user with an optimal set of images that try to capture the salient information of the scene.

Instead, sensor hub hardware, available in many smartphones today, can run continuous sensing at lower power while keeping the main processor idle.

We implement MobileHub, a system that automatically rewrites applications to leverage the sensor hub without additional programming effort. MobileHub uses a combination of dynamic taint tracking and machine learning to learn when it is safe to leverage the sensor hub without affecting application semantics.
