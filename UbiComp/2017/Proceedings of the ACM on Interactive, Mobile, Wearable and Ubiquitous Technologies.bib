 abstract = {In running, knee-related injuries are very common. The main cause are high impact forces when striking the ground with the heel first. Mid- or forefoot running is generally known to reduce impact loads and to be a more efficient running style. In this paper, we introduce a wearable running assistant, consisting of an electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) device and an insole with force sensing resistors. It detects heel striking and actuates the calf muscles during the flight phase to control the foot angle before landing. We conducted a user study, in which we compared the classical coaching approach using slow motion video analysis as a terminal feedback to our proposed real-time EMS feedback. The results show that EMS actuation significantly outperforms traditional coaching, i.e., a decreased average heel striking rate, when using the system. As an implication, EMS feedback can generally be beneficial for the motor learning of complex, repetitive movements.},

@article{Dementyev:2017:DWD:3075646.3053330,
 abstract = {Increased visual attention, such as during computer use leads to less blinking, which can cause dry eyes—the leading cause of computer vision syndrome. As people spend more time looking at screens on mobile and desktop devices, computer vision syndrome is becoming epidemic in today's population, leading to blurry vision, fatigue, and a reduced quality of life. One way to alleviate dry eyes is increased blinking. In this paper, we present a series of glasses-mounted devices that track the wearer's blink rate and, upon absent blinks, trigger blinks through actuation: light flashes, physical taps, and small puffs of air near the eye. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our devices and found that air puff and physical tap actuations result in a 36% increase in participants’ average blink rate. Air puff thereby struck the best compromise between effective blink actuations and low distraction ratings from participants. In a follow-up study, we found that high intensity, short puffs near the eye were most effective in triggering blinks while receiving only low-rated distraction and invasiveness ratings from participants. We conclude this paper with two miniaturized and self-contained DualBlink prototypes, one integrated into the frame of a pair of glasses and the other one as a clip-on for existing glasses. We believe that DualBlink can serve as an always-available and viable option to treat computer vision syndrome in the future.},

@article{Liu:2017:GAU:3075646.3053331,
 abstract = {Touchscreens, the dominant input type for mobile phones, require unique authentication solutions. Gesture passwords have been proposed as an alternative ubiquitous authentication technique. Prior security analysis has relied on inconsistent measurements such as mutual information or shoulder surfing attacks.We present the first approach for measuring the security of gestures with guessing attacks that model real-world attacker behavior. Our major contributions are: 1) a comprehensive analysis of the weak subspace for gesture passwords, 2) a method for enumerating the size of the full theoretical gesture password space, 3) a design of a novel guessing attack against user-chosen gestures using a dictionary, and 4) a brute-force attack used for benchmarking the performance of the guessing attack. Our dictionary attack, tested on newly collected user data, achieves a cracking rate of 47.71% after two weeks of computation using 109 guesses. This is a difference of 35.78 percentage points compared to the 11.93% cracking rate of the brute-force attack. In conclusion, users are not taking full advantage of the large theoretical password space and instead choose their gesture passwords from weak subspaces. We urge for further work on addressing this challenge.},
