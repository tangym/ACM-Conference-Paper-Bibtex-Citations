 abstract = {Localization for mobile devices has become important as the basis technology for various ubiquitous computing applications. While GPS is leveraged as the de-facto standard technology in outdoor localization, its accuracy is poor indoors. For twenty years, researchers have tried to investigate indoor localization technology using fingerprinting from received signal strength indicators (RSSIs). With the widespread use of smartphones in the last decade, device dependency (e.g. antenna characteristics) must be considered to avoid performance degradation, while most of the recent localization approaches assume that all the smartphone models have the same device characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel feature representation based on multiple RSSIs for compensating performance degradation against smartphone models changes. In contrast to the previous feature representation based on a single RSSI, our new feature representation, which we call Ellipsoid features, employs tuples of pair of RSSIs to eliminate device dependence in the path loss model for wave propagation. In contrast to recent advances in machine learning methods such as domain adaptation, multi-task learning, and semi-supervised learning, our approach requires no additional dataset nor retraining for the new target models. This simplicity would promote ubiquity of indoor localization in the era of smartphones. Moreover, our feature representation works well compared to the state-of-the-arts in feature representations based on multiple RSSIs even when only a small number of access points (APs) are available. Experimental result using smartphone devices including Android Nexus5, Nexus5X, Nexus6P, and Xperia X Performance shows that our approach achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art indoor localization models as well as robust performance against device changes.},

There is a growing body of research work on enabling novel interaction techniques and understanding user experiences of smartwatches. However, there is still lack of user experience research on wearing behaviors of smartwatches, which is critical for wearable device and service design. In this work, we investigate how college students wear smartwatches and what factors affect wearing behaviors by analyzing a longitudinal activity dataset collected from 50 smartwatch users for 203 days. Our results show that there are several temporal usage patterns and distinct groups of usage patterns. The factors affecting wearing behaviors are contextual, nuanced, and multifaceted. Our findings provide diverse design implications for improving wearability of smartwatches and leveraging smartwatches for behavioral changes.},

 abstract = {Heart rate is one of the most important vital signals for personal health tracking. A number of smartphone-based heart rate estimation systems have been proposed over the years. However, they either depend on special hardware sensors or suffer from the high noise due to the weakness of the heart signals, affecting their accuracy in many practical scenarios. Inspired by medical studies about the heart motion mechanics, we propose the HeartSense heart rate estimation system. Specifically, we show that the gyroscope sensor is the most sensitive sensor for measuring the heart rate. To further counter noise and handle different practical scenarios, we introduce a novel quality metric that allows us to fuse the different gyroscope axes in a probabilistic framework to achieve a robust and accurate estimate. We have implemented and evaluated our system on different Android phones. Results using 836 experiments on different subjects in practical scenarios with a side-by-side comparison with other systems show that HeartSense can achieve 1.03 bpm median absolute error for heart rate estimation. This is better than the state-of-the-art by more than 147% in median error, highlighting HeartSense promise as a ubiquitous system for medical and personal well-being applications.},

 abstract = {Analysis of everyday human gaze behaviour has significant potential for ubiquitous computing, as evidenced by a large body of work in gaze-based human-computer interaction, attentive user interfaces, and eye-based user modelling. However, current mobile eye trackers are still obtrusive, which not only makes them uncomfortable to wear and socially unacceptable in daily life, but also prevents them from being widely adopted in the social and behavioural sciences. To address these challenges we present InvisibleEye, a novel approach for mobile eye tracking that uses millimetre-size RGB cameras that can be fully embedded into normal glasses frames. To compensate for the cameras’ low image resolution of only a few pixels, our approach uses multiple cameras to capture different views of the eye, as well as learning-based gaze estimation to directly regress from eye images to gaze directions. We prototypically implement our system and characterise its performance on three large-scale, increasingly realistic, and thus challenging datasets: 1) eye images synthesised using a recent computer graphics eye region model, 2) real eye images recorded of 17 participants under controlled lighting, and 3) eye images recorded of four participants over the course of four recording sessions in a mobile setting. We show that InvisibleEye achieves a top person-specific gaze estimation accuracy of 1.79° using four cameras with a resolution of only 5 × 5 pixels. Our evaluations not only demonstrate the feasibility of this novel approach but, more importantly, underline its significant potential for finally realising the vision of invisible mobile eye tracking and pervasive attentive user interfaces.},

 abstract = {With the increasing popularity of mobile video games, game designers and developers are starting to integrate geolocation into video games. Popular location-based games such as Ingress or Pokémon Go have millions of users, yet little is known about how the use of such games influences the nature of a user’s interaction with other users and their physical surroundings. To investigate how location-based games are integrated into a player’s daily life, how they influence a player’s mobility through the city, their perception of places and the role of human territoriality in this context, we have developed a location-based mobile multiplayer game called CityConqueror. In this paper, we present CityConqueror and the results of a study, which has focused on participants playing the game over a period of two weeks. The findings show that location-based games can be designed to give the player the illusion of playing in the context of the “real” world rather than a virtual or hybrid game reality. Our findings also suggest that location-based games can have a strong influence on a player’s mobility and perception of urban space and that human territoriality can be expressed through location-based games. Based on our findings we propose a series of design implications for the design of mobile location-based games.},

Thus, we designed and implemented an immersive virtual reality (VR) online shopping environment. We tried to maintain the benefits of online shops, like search functionality and availability, while simultaneously focusing on shopping experience and immersion. By touching the third dimension, VR provides a more advanced form of visualization, which can increase the customer’s satisfaction and thus shopping experience. We further introduced the Virtual Reality Shopping Experience (VRSE) model based on customer satisfaction, task performance and user preference. A case study of a first VR shop prototype was conducted and evaluated with respect to the VRSE model. The results showed that the usability and user experience of our system is above average overall. In summary, searching for a product in a WebVR online shop using speech input in combination with VR output proved to be the best regarding user performance (speed, error rate) and preference (usability, user experience, immersion, motion sickness).},

 abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of VibeBin, a low-cost, non-intrusive and easy-to-install waste bin level detection system. Recent popularity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors has brought us unprecedented opportunities to enable a variety of new services for monitoring and controlling smart buildings. Indoor waste management is crucial to a healthy environment in smart buildings. Measuring the waste bin fill-level helps building operators schedule garbage collection more responsively and optimize the quantity and location of waste bins. Existing systems focus on directly and intrusively measuring the physical quantities of the garbage (weight, height, volume, etc.) or its appearance (image), and therefore require careful installation, laborious calibration or labeling, and can be costly. Our system indirectly measures fill-level by sensing the changes in motor-induced vibration characteristics on the outside surface of waste bins. VibeBin exploits the physical nature of vibration resonance of the waste bin and the garbage within, and learns the vibration features of different fill-levels through a few garbage collection (emptying) cycles in a completely unsupervised manner. VibeBin identifies vibration features of different fill-levels by clustering historical vibration samples based on a custom distance metric which measures the dissimilarity between two samples. We deploy our system on eight waste bins of different types and sizes, and show that under normal usage and real waste, it can deliver accurate level measurements after just 3 garbage collection cycles. The average F-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of measuring empty, half, and full levels achieves 0.912. A two-week deployment also shows that the false positive and false negative events are satisfactorily rare.},

 abstract = {Mobile-based ecological-momentary-assessment (EMA) is an in-situ measurement methodology where an electronic device prompts a person to answer questions of research interest. EMA has a key limitation: interruption burden. Microinteraction-EMA(µEMA) may reduce burden without sacrificing high temporal density of measurement. In µEMA, all EMA prompts can be answered with ‘at a glance' microinteractions. In a prior 4-week pilot study comparing standard EMA delivered on a phone (phone-EMA) vs. µEMA delivered on a smartwatch (watch-µEMA), watch-µEMA demonstrated higher response rates and lower perceived burden than phone-EMA, even when the watch-µEMA interruption rate was 8 times more than phone-EMA. A new 4-week dataset was gathered on smartwatch-based EMA (i.e., watch-EMA with 6 back-to-back, multiple-choice questions on a watch) to compare whether the high response rates of watch-µEMA previously observed were a result of using microinteractions, or due to the novelty and accessibility of the smartwatch. No statistically significant differences in compliance, completion, and first-prompt response rates were observed between phone-EMA and watch-EMA. However, watch-µEMA response rates were significantly higher than watch-EMA. This pilot suggests that (1) the high compliance and low burden previously observed in watch-µEMA is likely due to the microinteraction question technique, not simply the use of the watch versus the phone, and that (2) compliance with traditional EMA (with long surveys) may not improve simply by moving survey delivery from the phone to a smartwatch.},

We demonstrate how a smartphone and portable speaker playing music with embedded, inaudible signals can track multiple individuals’ locations and activities both within a room and through barriers in 2D space. We achieve this by transforming a smartphone into an active sonar system that emits a combination of a sonar pulse and music and listens to the reflections off of humans in the environment. Our implementation, CovertBand, monitors minute changes to these reflections to track multiple people concurrently and to recognize different types of motion, leaking information about where people are in addition to what they may be doing. We evaluated CovertBand by running experiments in five homes in the Seattle area, showing that we can localize both single and multiple individuals through barriers. These tests show CovertBand can track walking subjects with a mean tracking error of 18 cm and subjects moving at a fixed position with an accuracy of 8 cm at up to 6 m in line-of-sight and 3 m through barriers. We test a variety of rhythmic motions such as pumping arms, jumping, and supine pelvic tilts in through-wall scenarios and show that they produce discernibly different spectrograms from walking in the acoustic reflections. In tests with 33 subjects, we also show that even in ideal scenarios, listeners were unlikely to detect a CovertBand attack.},

 abstract = {The ubiquity of the Internet and the widespread proliferation of electronic devices has resulted in flourishing microtask crowdsourcing marketplaces, such as Amazon MTurk. An aspect that has remained largely invisible in microtask crowdsourcing is that of work environments; defined as the hardware and software affordances at the disposal of crowd workers which are used to complete microtasks on crowdsourcing platforms. In this paper, we reveal the significant role of work environments in the shaping of crowd work. First, through a pilot study surveying the good and bad experiences workers had with UI elements in crowd work, we revealed the typical issues workers face. Based on these findings, we then deployed over 100 distinct microtasks on CrowdFlower, addressing workers in India and USA in two identical batches. These tasks emulate the good and bad UI element designs that characterize crowdsourcing microtasks. We recorded hardware specifics such as CPU speed and device type, apart from software specifics including the browsers used to complete tasks, operating systems on the device, and other properties that define the work environments of crowd workers. Our findings indicate that crowd workers are embedded in a variety of work environments which influence the quality of work produced. To confirm and validate our data-driven findings we then carried out semi-structured interviews with a sample of Indian and American crowd workers from this platform. Depending on the design of UI elements in microtasks, we found that some work environments support crowd workers more than others. Based on our overall findings resulting from all the three studies, we introduce ModOp, a tool that helps to design crowdsourcing microtasks that are suitable for diverse crowd work environments. We empirically show that the use of ModOp results in reducing the cognitive load of workers, thereby improving their user experience without affecting the accuracy or task completion time.},

To address this, commercial drones have been moving towards a safe-to-touch design or have increased safety by adding propeller guards. The affordances of safe-to-touch drones enable new types of touch-based human-drone interaction. Various applications have been explored, such as augmented sports and haptic feedback in virtual reality; however, it is unclear if individuals feel comfortable using direct touch and manipulation when interacting with safe-to-touch drones. A previous elicitation study showed how users naturally interact with drones. We replicated this study with an unsafe and a safe-to-touch drone, to find out if participants will instinctively use touch as a means of interacting with the safe-to-touch drone. We found that 58% of the participants used touch, and across all tasks 39% of interactions were touch-based. The proposed touch interactions were in agreement for 67% of the tasks, and users reported that interacting with the safe-to-touch drone was significantly less mentally demanding than the unsafe drone.},

@article{Yabe:2017:CMF:3139486.3130982,
 abstract = {Economic loss caused by natural disasters is increasing in many cities around the world. There is an increasing demand for a method that effectively measures the fragility of people flow to appropriately plan the future investment into infrastructure. Conventional methods measure the fragility of urban systems using infrastructure data such as the road and railway networks. However, these methods are costly to perform, cannot directly measure the disruption on human activities caused by disasters, nor can they be applied for individual disasters. Here, we propose a novel method that quantifies the fragility of cities through detecting the delay in commuting activities using GPS data collected from smartphones. Because commuting activities are daily routines for many people, commuting flow has little day-to-day fluctuation, which makes it an appropriate metric for detecting anomalies and disruption in urban systems. This method can be utilized in any city in the world regardless of differences in network structures or population distribution, as long as people commute on a daily basis. We validate our method in various cities for snowfall and typhoons using real datasets in Japan, and show that intuitive results can be obtained. Our method's reliability is clarified by comparing the results with conventional metrics. We also present useful analyses and applications of CityFlowFragility for urban planning and disaster management.},

 abstract = {Although ski jumping is a widely investigated sport, competitions and training sessions are rarely supported by state-of-the-art technology. Supporting technologies could focus on a continuous velocity determination and visualization for competitions as well as on an analysis of the velocity development and the jump length for training sessions. In the literature, there are several approaches for jump analysis. However, the majority of these approaches aim for a biomechanical analysis instead of a support system for frequent use. They do not fulfill the requirements of unobtrusiveness and usability that are necessary for a long-term application in competitions and training. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for ski velocity calculation and jump length determination based on the processing of unobtrusively obtained ski jumping data. Our algorithm is evaluated with data from eleven athletes in two different acquisitions. The results show an error of the velocity measurement at take-off of (which equals -3.0 % ± 4.7 % in reference to the estimated average take-off velocity) compared to a light barrier system. The error of the jump length compared to a video-based system is 0.8 m ± 2.9 m (which equals 0.9 % ± 3.4 % of the average jump length of the training jumps in this work). Although our proposed system does not outperform existing camera-based methods of jump length measurements at competitions, it provides an affordable and unobtrusive support for competitions and has the potential to simplify analyses in standard training.},

 abstract = {A main challenge faced by the state-of-the-art parking sensing systems is to infer the state of the spots not covered by participants’ parking/unparking events (called background availability) when the system penetration rate is limited. In this paper, we tackle this problem by exploring an empirical phenomenon that ignoring a spot along a driver’s parking search trajectory is likely due to the unavailability. However, complications caused by drivers’ preferences, e.g. ignoring the spots too far from the driver’s destination, have to be addressed based on human parking decisions. We build a model based on a dataset of more than 55,000 real parking decisions to predict the probability that a driver would take a spot, assuming the spot is available. Then, we present a crowdsourcing system, called ParkScan, which leverages the learned parking decision model in collaboration with the hidden Markov model to estimate background parking spot availability. We evaluated ParkScan with real-world data from both off-street scenarios (i.e., two public parking lots) and an on-street parking scenario (i.e., 35 urban blocks in Seattle). Both of the experiments showed that with a 5% penetration rate, ParkScan reduces over 12.9% of availability estimation errors for all the spots during parking peak hours, compared to the baseline using only the historical data. Also, even with a single participant driver, ParkScan cuts off at least 15% of the estimation errors for the spots along the driver’s parking search trajectory.},

@article{Wu:2017:CGS:3139486.3130981,
 abstract = {Trajectory data generated by outdoor activities have great potential for location based services. However, depending on the localization technique used, certain trajectory data could contain large errors. For example, the error of trajectories generated by cellular-based localization techniques is around 100m which is ten times larger than that of GPS-based trajectories. Hence, enhancing the utility of those large-error trajectories becomes a challenge. In this paper we show how to improve the quality of trajectory data having large errors. Some existing works reduce the error through hardware which requires information such as the time of arrival (TOA), received signal strength indication (RSSI), the position of cell towers, etc. Moreover, different positioning techniques will result in different hardware-based solutions and different data formats, which limit the generalizablity. Other works study a related but different problem, i.e., map matching, with the aid of road network information, to reduce the uncertainty and the noise of trajectory data. However, most of these approaches are designed for the GPS-sampled data, and hence they might not be able to achieve a similar performance when applied directly to trajectories with large errors. Motivated by this, we propose a general error reduction system namely CLSTERS for trajectories with large scale of errors. Our system is hardware independent and only requires the coordinates and the time stamp of each sample point which makes it general and ubiquitous. We present results from experiments using three real-world datasets in three different cities generated by two different localization techniques and the results show that our approach outperforms existing solutions.},

While this information is often important, the timing of the interruptions may detract from analyst's work. In an ideal world, there would be no interruptions. But that is not the case in real world sensemaking tasks. So, in this study, we explore the value of timing interruptions based on an analyst's state of arousal as detected by Electrodermal activity derived form galvanic skin response (EDA). In a laboratory study, we compared performance when interruptions were timed to occur during increasing arousal, decreasing arousal, at random intervals or not at all. Analysts performed significantly better when interruptions occurred during periods of increasing arousal than when they were random. Further, analysts rated process component of team experience significantly higher also during periods of increasing arousal than when they were random. Self-reported workload was not impacted by interruptions timing. We discuss how system designs could leverage inexpensive off-the-shelf wrist sensors to improve interruption timing.},

However, the design trade-offs between the different representations of a smart home’s capabilities are still not well-understood. In this work, we examine how four different smart home abstractions affect end users’ mental models of a hypothetical system. We develop four questionnaires, each of which describes the same hypothetical smart home using a different abstraction, and then we collect responses depicting desired smart home applications from over 1,500 Mechanical Turk workers. We find that the choice of abstraction strongly primes end users’ responses. In particular, the purely device-oriented abstraction results in the most limited scenarios, suggesting that if we want users to associate smart home technologies with valuable high-level applications we should shift the UI paradigm for the Internet of Things from device-oriented control to other abstractions that inspire a greater diversity of interactions.},

Passive haptic learning (PHL) has already demonstrated some benefit for learning the Braille text entry system. Could this computing-enabled technique be used to improve desktop keyboard typing skills? It is unknown whether passive haptic training can improve speed on a motor task (as opposed to initial learning). We use a randomized numeric keypad to examine users’ typing performance with or without passive haptic training. When users were prevented from looking at the keyboard, the PHL group demonstrated consistent accuracy (-0.011 KSPC) while those in the control group greatly increased their error (+1.26 KSPC on average). This result is consistent with the finding that PHL users looked significantly less at the keyboard. In a second, longer study, users exposed to PHL were found to significantly improve their typing speed (mean increase of 11 WPM) versus control (mean increase of 2.2 WPM).},

As an alternative, thumb-to-finger touches present a promising input mechanism that is subtle yet capable of complex interactions. We present DigiTouch, a reconfigurable glove-based input device that enables thumb-to-finger touch interaction by sensing continuous touch position and pressure. Our novel sensing technique improves the reliability of continuous touch tracking and estimating pressure on resistive fabric interfaces. We demonstrate DigiTouch’s utility by enabling a set of easily reachable and reconfigurable widgets such as buttons and sliders. Since DigiTouch senses continuous touch position, widget layouts can be customized according to user preferences and application needs. As an example of a real-world application of this reconfigurable input device, we examine a split-QWERTY keyboard layout mapped to the user’s fingers. We evaluate DigiTouch for text entry using a multi-session study.

We conducted a lab study by creating interpretations of five paintings with 13 people with visual impairments and found that participants enjoyed interacting with the artwork. We then created a live installation with a visually impaired artist to iterate on this concept to account for multiple users and paintings. We learned that a proxemic audio interface allows for people to feel immersed in the artwork. Proxemic audio interfaces are similar to visual because they increase in detail with closer proximity, but are different because they need a descriptive verbal overview to give context.

To this end, this paper proposes PRADO, an approach to measuring various aspects of user adoption, including app download and installation, uninstallation, and user ratings. PRADO employs advanced machine learning algorithms to predict user adoption based on how these metrics correlate to a comprehensive taxonomy of 108 developer-controllable features of the app. To evaluate PRADO, we use 9,824 free apps along with their behavioral data from 12.57 million Android users, demonstrating that user adoption of a new app can be accurately predicted. We also derive insights on which factors are statistically significant to user adoption, and suggest what kinds of actions can be possibly performed by developers in practice.},

At present, automated vehicles lack any form of continual, appropriate feedback to re-establish this connection and offer a feeling of control. We suggest that auditory feedback can be used to support the driver in this context. A preliminary field study that explored how drivers respond to existing auditory feedback in manual vehicles was first undertaken. We then designed a set of abstract, synthesised sounds presented spatially around the driver, known as Spatial Earcons, that represented different primary driving sounds e.g. acceleration. To evaluate their effectiveness, we undertook a driving simulator study in an outdoor setting using a real vehicle. Spatial Earcons performed as well as Existing Vehicle Sounds during automated and manual driving scenarios. Subjective responses suggested Spatial Earcons produced an engaging driving experience. This paper argues that entirely new synthesised primary driving sounds, such as Spatial Earcons, can be designed for automated vehicles to replace Existing Vehicle Sounds. This creates new possibilities for presenting primary driving information in automated vehicles using auditory feedback, in order to re-establish a connection between driver and vehicle.},

Yet, there remains a stunning lack of convenient tools for promoting long-term and effective meditation practice. In this paper, we present MindfulWatch, a practical smartwatch-based sensing system that monitors respiration in real-time during meditation -- offering essential biosignals that can potentially be used to empower various future applications such as tracking changes in breathing pattern, offering real-time guidance, and providing an accurate bio-marker for meditation research. To this end, MindfulWatch is designed to be convenient for everyday use with no training required. Operating solely on a smartwatch, MindfulWatch can immediately reach the growing population of smartwatch users, making it ideal for longitudinal data collection for meditation studies. Specifically, it utilizes motion sensors to sense the subtle “micro” wrist rotation (0.01 rad/s) induced by respiration. To accurately capture breathing, we developed a novel self-adaptive model that tracks changes in both breathing pattern and meditation posture over time. MindfulWatch was evaluated based on data from 36 real-world meditation sessions (8.7 hours, 11 subjects). The results suggest that MindfulWatch offers reliable real-time respiratory timing measurement (70% errors under 0.5 seconds).},

 abstract = {The use of wearable devices during running has become commonplace. Although there is ongoing research on interaction techniques for use while running, the effects of the resulting interactions on the natural movement patterns have received little attention so far. While previous studies on pedestrians reported increased task load and reduced walking speed while interacting, running movement further restricts interaction and requires minimizing interferences, e.g. to avoid injuries and maximize comfort. In this paper, we aim to shed light on how interacting with wearable devices affects running movement. We present results from a motion-tracking study (N=12) evaluating changes in movement and task load when users interact with a smartphone, a smartwatch, or a pair of smartglasses while running. In our study, smartwatches required less effort than smartglasses when using swipe input, resulted in less interference with the running movement and were preferred overall. From our results, we infer a number of guidelines regarding interaction design targeting runners.},

 abstract = {This study aims at revealing how commercial hotness of urban commercial districts (UCDs) is shaped by social contexts of surrounding areas so as to render predictive business planning. We define social contexts for a given region as the number of visitors, the region functions, the population and buying power of local residents, the average price of services, and the rating scores of customers, which are computed from heterogeneous data including taxi GPS trajectories, point of interests, geographical data, and user-generated comments. Then, we apply sparse representation to discover the impactor factor of each variable of the social contexts in terms of predicting commercial activeness of UCDs under a linear predictive model. The experiments show that a linear correlation between social contexts and commercial activeness exists for Beijing and Shanghai based on an average prediction accuracy of 77.69% but the impact factors of social contexts vary from city to city, where the key factors are rich life services, diversity of restaurants, good shopping experience, large number of local residents with relatively high purchasing power, and convenient transportation. This study reveals the underlying mechanism of urban business ecosystems, and promise social context-aware business planning over heterogeneous urban big data.},

@article{Kim:2017:UUR:3139486.3130931,
 abstract = {As robots increasingly enter our everyday life, we envision a future in which robots are ubiquitous and interact with both ourselves and our environments. This paper introduces the concept of ubiquitous robotic interfaces (URIs), multi-robot interfaces capable of mobility, manipulation, sensing, display and interaction. URIs interact directly with the user and indirectly through surrounding objects. A key aspect of URIs is their ability to display information to users either by collectively forming shapes or through their movements. In this paper, we focus on the use of URIs to display information in ubiquitous settings. We first investigate the use of abstract motion as a display for URIs by studying human perception of abstract multi-robot motion. With ten small robots, we produced 42 videos of bio-inspired abstract motion by varying three parameters (7 x 2 x 3): bio-inspired behavior, speed and smoothness. In a crowdsourced between-subjects study, 1067 subjects were recruited to watch the videos and describe their perception through Likert scales and free text. Study results suggest that different bio-inspired behaviors elicit significantly different responses in arousal, dominance, hedonic and pragmatic qualities, animacy, urgency and willingness to attend. On the other hand, speed significantly affects valence, arousal, hedonic quality, urgency and animacy while smoothness affects hedonic quality, animacy, attractivity and likeability. We discuss how these results inform URI designers to formulate appropriate motion for different interaction scenarios and use these results to derive our own example applications using our URI platform, UbiSwarm.},

 abstract = {Current digital systems are largely blind to users’ cognitive states. Systems that adapt to users’ states show great potential for augmenting cognition and for creating novel user experiences. However, most approaches for sensing cognitive states, and cognitive load specifically, involve obtrusive technologies, such as physiological sensors attached to users’ bodies. This paper present an unobtrusive indicator of the users’ cognitive load based on thermal imaging that is applicable in real-world. We use a commercial thermal camera to monitor a person’s forehead and nose temperature changes to estimate their cognitive load. To assess the effect of different levels of cognitive load on facial temperature we conducted a user study with 12 participants. The study showed that different levels of the Stroop test and the complexity of reading texts affect facial temperature patterns, thereby giving a measure of cognitive load. To validate the feasibility for real-time assessments of cognitive load, we conducted a second study with 24 participants, we analyzed the temporal latency of temperature changes. Our system detected temperature changes with an average latency of 0.7 seconds after users were exposed to a stimulus, outperforming latency in related work that used other thermal imaging techniques. We provide empirical evidence showing how to unobtrusively detect changes in cognitive load in real-time. Our exploration of exposing users to different content types gives rise to thermal-based activity tracking, which facilitates new applications in the field of cognition-aware computing.},

 abstract = {IoT devices are in general considered to be straightforward to use. However, we find that there are a number of situations where the usability becomes poor. The situations include but not limited to the followings: 1) when initializing an IoT device, 2) when trying to control an IoT device which is initialized by another person, and 3) when trying to control an IoT device out of many of the same type. We tackle these situations by proposing a new association-free communication method, QuickTalk. QuickTalk lets a user device such as a smartphone pinpoint and activate an IoT device with the help of an IR transmitter and communicate with the pinpointed IoT device through the broadcast channel of WiFi without a conventional association process. This nature, QuickTalk allows a user device to immediately give a command to a specific IoT device in proximity even when the IoT device is uninitialized, unassociated with the control interface of the user, or associated but visually indistinguishable from others of the same kind. Our experiments of QuickTalk implemented on Raspberry Pi 2 devices show that QuickTalk does its job quickly and intuitively. The end-to-end delay of QuickTalk for transmitting an IoT command is on average about 0.74 seconds, and is upper bounded by 2.5 seconds. We further confirm that even when an IoT device has ongoing data sessions with other devices, which disturb the broadcast channel, QuickTalk can still reliably communicate with the IoT device at the cost of minor throughput degradation.},

Most recent research has focused on activity recognition, but little has been done on sensor-based detection of process progress. We introduce a real-time, sensor-based system for modeling, recognizing and estimating the progress of a work process. We implemented a multimodal deep learning structure to extract the relevant spatio-temporal features from multiple sensory inputs and used a novel deep regression structure for overall completeness estimation. Using process completeness estimation with a Gaussian mixture model, our system can predict the phase for sequential processes. The performance speed, calculated using completeness estimation, allows online estimation of the remaining time. To train our system, we introduced a novel rectified hyperbolic tangent (rtanh) activation function and conditional loss. Our system was tested on data obtained from the medical process (trauma resuscitation) and sports events (Olympic swimming competition). Our system outperformed the existing trauma-resuscitation phase detectors with a phase detection accuracy of over 86%, an F1-score of 0.67, a completeness estimation error of under 12.6%, and a remaining-time estimation error of less than 7.5 minutes. For the Olympic swimming dataset, our system achieved an accuracy of 88%, an F1-score of 0.58, a completeness estimation error of 6.3% and a remaining-time estimation error of 2.9 minutes.},

However, food journaling is subject to self-bias and recall errors, and is poorly adhered to by patients. In this paper, we propose an alternative by introducing EarBit, a wearable system that detects eating moments. We evaluate the performance of inertial, optical, and acoustic sensing modalities and focus on inertial sensing, by virtue of its recognition and usability performance. Using data collected in a simulated home setting with minimum restrictions on participants’ behavior, we build our models and evaluate them with an unconstrained outside-the-lab study. For both studies, we obtained video footage as ground truth for participants activities. Using leave-one-user-out validation, EarBit recognized all the eating episodes in the semi-controlled lab study, and achieved an accuracy of 90.1% and an F1-score of 90.9% in detecting chewing instances. In the unconstrained, outside-the-lab evaluation, EarBit obtained an accuracy of 93% and an F1-score of 80.1% in detecting chewing instances. It also accurately recognized all but one recorded eating episodes. These episodes ranged from a 2 minute snack to a 30 minute meal.},

 abstract = {Detecting the events of indoor everyday objects such as door or window open/close events has been actively studied to implement such applications as intrusion detection, adaptive HVAC control, and monitoring an independently living elderly person. This study proposes a method for detecting the events and states of indoor everyday objects such as doors and windows without using distributed sensors attached to the objects. In this study, we achieve practical and unobtrusive event detection using a commodity Wi-Fi access point and a computer equipped with a commodity Wi-Fi module. Specifically, we detect the events using Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI), which describes how a signal propagates from a transmitter to a receiver, and is affected by such events. To handle CSI data that consists of the mixed effects of multiple indoor objects in an environment of interest, we employ independent component analysis to separate the events caused by the objects. The decomposed data are then fed into our event classifier based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks to automatically extract features from CSI data, as it is difficult to intuitively design features to be extracted from the CSI data. Moreover, we correct the neural network estimates by incorporating knowledge about the state transitions of an object using hidden Markov models. For example, because the “open” event of a door occurs only when the door is in a “closed” state. We correct impossible state transitions estimated by the neural network based on this knowledge.},

 abstract = {The vision of embedding connectivity into billions of everyday objects runs into the reality of existing communication technologies -- there is no existing wireless technology that can provide reliable and long-range communication at tens of microwatts of power as well as cost less than a dime. While backscatter is low-power and low-cost, it is known to be limited to short ranges. This paper overturns this conventional wisdom about backscatter and presents the first wide-area backscatter system. Our design can successfully backscatter from any location between an RF source and receiver, separated by 475 m, while being compatible with commodity LoRa hardware. Further, when our backscatter device is co-located with the RF source, the receiver can be as far as 2.8 km away. We deploy our system in a 4,800 ft2 (446 m2) house spread across three floors, a 13,024 ft2 (1210 m2) office area covering 41 rooms, as well as a one-acre (4046 m2) vegetable farm and show that we can achieve reliable coverage, using only a single RF source and receiver. We also build a contact lens prototype as well as a flexible epidermal patch device attached to the human skin. We show that these devices can reliably backscatter data across a 3,328 ft2 (309 m2) room. Finally, we present a design sketch of a LoRa backscatter IC that shows that it costs less than a dime at scale and consumes only 9.25 &mgr;W of power, which is more than 1000x lower power than LoRa radio chipsets.},

Despite the vast number of available tools, however, it is still challenging for self-trackers to find apps that suit their unique tracking needs, preferences, and commitments. Furthermore, people are bounded by the tracking tools’ initial design because it is difficult to modify, extend, or mash up existing tools. In this paper, we present OmniTrack, a mobile self-tracking system, which enables self-trackers to construct their own trackers and customize tracking items to meet their individual tracking needs. To inform the OmniTrack design, we first conducted semi-structured interviews (N = 12) and analyzed existing mobile tracking apps (N = 62). We then designed and developed OmniTrack as an Android mobile app, leveraging a semi-automated tracking approach that combines manual and automated tracking methods. We evaluated OmniTrack through a usability study (N = 10) and improved its interfaces based on the feedback. Finally, we conducted a 3-week deployment study (N = 21) to assess if people can capitalize on OmniTrack’s flexible and customizable design to meet their tracking needs. From the study, we showed how participants used OmniTrack to create, revise, and appropriate trackers—ranging from a simple mood tracker to a sophisticated daily activity tracker. We discuss how OmniTrack positively influences and supports self-trackers’ tracking practices over time, and how to further improve OmniTrack by providing more appropriate visualizations and sharable templates, incorporating external contexts, and supporting researchers’ unique data collection needs.},

 abstract = {Eye contact is a crucial element of non-verbal communication that signifies interest, attention, and participation in social interactions. As a result, measures of eye contact arise in a variety of applications such as the assessment of the social communication skills of children at risk for developmental disorders such as autism, or the analysis of turn-taking and social roles during group meetings. However, the automated measurement of visual attention during naturalistic social interactions is challenging due to the difficulty of estimating a subject’s looking direction from video. This paper proposes a novel approach to eye contact detection during adult-child social interactions in which the adult wears a point-of-view camera which captures an egocentric view of the child’s behavior. By analyzing the child’s face regions and inferring their head pose we can accurately identify the onset and duration of the child’s looks to their social partner’s eyes. We introduce the Pose-Implicit CNN, a novel deep learning architecture that predicts eye contact while implicitly estimating the head pose. We present a fully automated system for eye contact detection that solves the sub-problems of end-to-end feature learning and pose estimation using deep neural networks. To train our models, we use a dataset comprising 22 hours of 156 play session videos from over 100 children, half of whom are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. We report an overall precision of 0.76, recall of 0.80, and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.79, all of which are significant improvements over existing methods.},

However, such services are hampered by the difficulty of finding relevant and convenient opportunities for transactions in a timely fashion. Many transaction opportunities are missed as a consequence of members not being aware of offers and/or requests from people nearby or en route that match their needs and/or abilities. In this paper, we explore the impact of context-awareness on P2P-VSTs to address this problem. Using mobile technology and an in situ study, we evaluate how recommending service requests targeted at a person’s context impacts their willingness to enter a transaction. Our results show that, even when people have not actively volunteered for a service, they are significantly more likely to accept a transaction opportunity if it is convenient for them in terms of time and location. These findings demonstrate how context-aware technology holds the promise of increasing the efficiency and activity level in P2P-VST systems.},

First, it is zero effort, i.e., it neither requires the user to wear a sensor nor to record any data. It monitors the user remotely by analyzing the radio signals that bounce off her body. Second, it delivers new features unavailable with other devices such as automatically detecting where the user sleeps and her exact bed schedule, while simultaneously monitoring multiple users in different beds. Third, it is highly accurate. Its average error in measuring sleep latency and total sleep time is 4.9 min and 10.3 min, respectively.},

In a 19-day long field study with 70 participants, we evaluate the quality of work that CrowdPickUp produces. In particular, we measure quality in terms of worker performance in a variety of tasks (requiring local knowledge, location-based, general) while using a number of different quality control mechanisms, and also capture workers’ perceptions of the platform. Our findings show that workers of CrowdPickUp contributed data of comparable quality to previously presented crowdsourcing deployments while at the same time allowing for a wide breadth of tasks to be deployed. Finally, we offer insights towards the continued exploration of this research agenda.},

 abstract = {As smartphones and tablets become increasingly prevalent, more customers have multiple devices. The multi-user, multi-device interactions inspire many problems worthy of investigation, among which recognizing users across devices has significant implications on recommendation, advertising and user experience. Unlike the binary classification problem in user identification on a single device, cross-device user recognition is essentially a set partition problem. The app back-end aims to divide user activities on devices hosting the app into groups each associated with one user. In this paper, we present XRec which leverages user behavioral patterns, namely when, where and how a user uses the app, to achieve the recognition. To address the user-device partition problem, we propose a classification-plus-refinement algorithm. To validate our approach, we conduct a field study with an Android app. We instrument the app to collect usage data from real users. We provide proof-of-concept experimental results to demonstrate how XRec can provide added value to mobile apps, with the ability to correctly match a user across multiple devices with 70% recall and 90% precision.},

@article{Li:2017:ADC:3139486.3130938,
 abstract = {In this work, we propose a system that detects approaching cars for smartphone users. In addition to detecting the presence of a vehicle, it can also estimate the vehicle’s driving direction, as well as count the number of cars around the user. We achieve these goals by processing the acoustic signal captured by microphones embedded in the user’s mobile phone. The largest challenge we faced involved addressing the fact that vehicular noise is predominantly due to tire-road friction, and therefore lacked strong (frequency) formant or temporal structure. Additionally, outdoor environments have complex acoustic noise characteristics, which are made worse when the signal is captured by non-professional grade microphones embedded in smartphones. We address these challenges by monitoring a new feature: maximal frequency component that crosses a threshold. We extract this feature with a blurred edge detector. Through detailed experiments, we found our system to be robust across different vehicles and environmental conditions, and thereby support unsupervised car detection and counting. We evaluated our system using audio tracks recorded from seven different models of cars, including SUVs, medium-sized sedans, compact cars, and electric cars. We also tested our system with the user walking in various outdoor environments including parking lots, campus roads, residential areas, and shopping centers. Our results show that we can accurately and robustly detect cars with low CPU and memory requirements.},

By exploiting WiFi signals reflected by human body, there have been many WiFi-based device-free human sensing applications. Among these applications, person identification is a fundamental technology to enable user-specific services. In this paper, we present Rapid, a system that can perform robust person identification in a device-free and low-cost manner, using fine-grained channel information (i.e., CSI) of WiFi and acoustic information from footstep sound. In order to achieve high accuracy in real-life scenarios with both system and environment noise, we perform noise estimation and include two different confidence values to quantify the impact of noise to both CSI and acoustic measurements. Based on an accurate gait analysis, we then adaptively fuse CSI and acoustic measurements to achieve robust person identification. We implement low-cost Rapid nodes and evaluate our system using experiments at multiple locations with a total of 1800 gait instances from 20 volunteers, and the results show that Rapid identifies a subject with an average accuracy of 92% to 82% from a group of 2 to 6 subjects, respectively.},

 abstract = {Large-scale mobile data studies can reveal valuable insights into user behavior, which in turn can assist system designers to create better user experiences. After a careful review of existing mobile data literature, we found that there have been no large-scale studies to understand smartphone usage behavior in India -- the second-largest and fastest growing smartphone market in the world. With the goal of understanding various facets of smartphone usage in India, we conducted a mixed-method longitudinal data collection study through an Android app released on Google Play. Our app was installed by 215 users, and logged 11.9 million data points from them over a period of 8 months. We analyzed this rich dataset along the lines of four broad facets of smartphone behavior -- how users use different apps, interact with notihcations, react to different contexts, and charge their smartphones -- to paint a holistic picture of smartphone usage behavior of Indian users. This quantitative analysis was complemented by a survey with 55 users and semi-structured interviews with 26 users to deeply understand their smartphone usage behavior. While our first-of-its-kind study uncovered many interesting facts about Indian smartphone users, we also found striking differences in usage behavior compared to past studies in other geographical contexts. We observed that Indian users spend significant time with their smartphones after midnight, continuously check notifications without attending to them and are extremely conscious about their smartphones’ battery. Perhaps the most dramatic finding is the nature of mobile consumerism of Indian users as shown by our results. Taken together, these and the rest of our findings demonstrate the unique characteristics that are shaping the smartphone usage behavior of Indian users.},

To support these context-aware UIs, we investigate the performance of our context recognizer in which recognition is based on machine-learning using the accelerometers in a smartphone and smartwatch. We conduct seven different evaluations using four machine-learning algorithms: J48 decision tree, sequential minimal optimization (SMO)-based support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and multilayer perceptron. With each algorithm, we conduct a long-interval experiment to examine the level of accuracy at which each context is recognized using data previously collected for training. The results show that SMO-based SVM is suitable for recognizing the 24 contexts considered in this study.},

Fortunately, as there are so many users sharing an app market, it is likely that some other users with the same preferences have already made the comparisons and shared their opinions. For example, a user may state that an app is better in power consumption than another app in a review, then the review would help other users who care about battery life while choosing apps. This paper presents a method to identify comparative reviews for mobile apps from an app market, which can be used to provide fine-grained app comparisons based on different topics. According to experiments on 5 million reviews from Google Play and manual assessments on 900 reviews, our method is able to identify opinions accurately and provide meaningful comparisons between apps, which could in turn help users find desired apps based on their preferences.},

 abstract = {A recent trend in corporate real-estate is Activity-Based Working (ABW). The ABW concept removes designated desks but offers different work settings designed to support typical work activities. In this context there is still a need for objective data to understand the implications of these design decisions. We aim to contribute by using automated data collection to study how ABW’s principles impact office usage and dynamics. To this aim we analyse team dynamics and employees’ tie strength in relation to space usage and organisational hierarchy using data collected with wearable devices in a company adopting ABW principles. Our findings show that the office fosters interactions across team boundaries and among the lower levels of the hierarchy suggesting a strong lateral communication. Employees also tend to have low space exploration on a daily basis which is instead more prevalent during an average week and strong social clusters seem to be resisting the ABW principles of space dynamics. With the availability of two additional data sets about social encounters in traditional offices we highlight traits emerging from the application of ABW’s principles. In particular, we observe how the absence of designated desks might be responsible for more rapid dynamics inside the office. In more general terms, this work opens the door to new and scalable technology-based methodologies to study dynamic office usage and social interactions.},

 abstract = {Although mobile context instrumentation frameworks have simplified the development of mobile context-aware applications, it remains challenging to test such applications. In this paper, we present TestAWARE that enables developers to systematically test context-aware applications in laboratory settings. To achieve this, TestAWARE is able to download, replay and emulate contextual data on either physical devices or emulators. To support both white -box and black-box testing, TestAWARE has been implemented as a novel structure with a mobile client and code library. In blackbox testing scenarios, developers can manage data replay through the mobile client, without writing testing scripts or modifying the source code of the targeted application. In white-box testing scenarios, developers can manage data replay and test functional/non-functional properties of the targeted application by writing testing scripts using the code library. We evaluated TestAWARE by quantifying its maximal data replay speed, and by conducting a user study with 13 developers. We show that TestAWARE can overcome data synchronisation challenges, and found that PC-based emulators can replay data significantly faster than physical smartphones and tablets. The user study highlights the usefulness of TestAWARE in the systematic testing of mobile context-aware applications in laboratory settings.},

Subsequently, participants rate the quality of these entries by playing a game with a purpose.

 abstract = {Automated dietary monitoring solutions that can find when, what, and how much individuals consume are needed for many applications such as providing feedback to individuals with chronic disease. Advances in body-worn sensors have led to systems with high accuracy for finding meals and even which foods are consumed in each bite. However, most tests are done in controlled lab settings with restricted meal choices, little background noise, and subjects focused on eating. For these systems to be adopted by users it is critical that they work well in realistic situations and be able to handle confounding factors such as background noise, shared meals, and multi-tasking. Work in realistic environments usually has lower accuracy, but has challenges in determining ground truth. Most critically, there has been a significant gap between lab and free-living environments. This is compounded by data usually being collected for different individuals in each setting, making it difficult to determine how the accuracy gap can be closed. We present a multi-modality study on eating recognition, using body-worn motion (head, wrists) and audio (earbud microphone) sensors for 12 participants (6 from the lab study, 6 new to test generalizability). In contrast to the lab, where audio alone has the highest accuracy, we find now that a combination of sensing modalities (audio, motion) is needed; yet sensor placement (head vs. wrist) is not critical. We further find that lab data does generalize to other participants, but while personal free-living data improves accuracy, more data from others can actually lead to worse performance.},

We present SugarMate, a first smartphone-based blood glucose inference system as a temporary alternative to continuous blood glucose monitors (CGM) when they are uncomfortable or inconvenient to wear. In addition to the records of food, drug and insulin intake, it leverages smartphone sensors to measure physical activities and sleep quality automatically. Provided with the imbalanced and often limited measurements, a challenge of SugarMate is the inference of blood glucose levels at a fine-grained time resolution. We propose Md3RNN, an efficient learning paradigm to make full use of the available blood glucose information. Specifically, the newly designed grouped input layers, together with the adoption of a deep RNN model, offer an opportunity to build blood glucose models for the general public based on limited personal measurements from single-user and grouped-users perspectives. Evaluations on 112 users demonstrate that Md3RNN yields an average accuracy of 82.14%, significantly outperforming previous learning methods those are either shallow, generically structured, or oblivious to grouped behaviors. Also, a user study with the 112 participants shows that SugarMate is acceptable for practical usage.},

Unlike existing approaches that require dedicated hardware (e.g., high resolution camera), high computation overhead (powerful CPU) or specific user behavior (keeping head steady), Gazture provides gesture recognition based on easy-to-control user gaze input with a small overhead. To achieve this goal, Gazture incorporates a two-layer structure: The first layer focuses on real-time gaze estimation with acceptable tracking accuracy while incurring a small overhead. The second layer implements a robust gesture recognition algorithm while compensating gaze estimation error. To address user posture change while using mobile device, we design a online transfer function based method to convert current eye features into corresponding eye features in reference posture, which then facilitates efficient gaze position estimation. We implement Gazture on Lenovo Tab3 8 Plus tablet with Android 6.0.1, and evaluate its performance in different scenarios. The evaluation results show that Gazture can achieve a high accuracy in gesture recognition while incurring a low overhead.},

 abstract = {We propose Glabella, a wearable device that continuously and unobtrusively monitors heart rates at three sites on the wearer’s head. Our glasses prototype incorporates optical sensors, processing, storage, and communication components, all integrated into the frame to passively collect physiological data about the user without the need for any interaction. Glabella continuously records the stream of reflected light intensities from blood flow as well as inertial measurements of the user’s head. From the temporal differences in pulse events across the sensors, our prototype derives the wearer’s pulse transit time on a beat-to-beat basis. Numerous efforts have found a significant correlation between a person’s pulse transit time and their systolic blood pressure. In this paper, we leverage this insight to continuously observe pulse transit time as a proxy for the behavior of systolic blood pressure levels—at a substantially higher level of convenience and higher rate than traditional blood pressure monitors, such as cuff-based oscillometric devices. This enables our prototype to model the beat-to-beat fluctuations in the user’s blood pressure over the course of the day and record its short-term responses to events, such as postural changes, exercise, eating and drinking, resting, medication intake, location changes, or time of day. During our in-the-wild evaluation, four participants wore a custom-fit Glabella prototype device over the course of five days throughout their daytime job and regular activities. Participants additionally measured their radial blood pressure three times an hour using a commercial oscillometric cuff. Our analysis shows a high correlation between the pulse transit times computed on our devices with participants’ heart rates (mean r = 0.92, SE = 0.03, angular artery) and systolic blood pressure values measured using the oscillometric cuffs (mean r = 0.79, SE = 0.15, angular-superficial temporal artery, considering participants’ self-administered cuff-based measurements as ground truth). Our results indicate that Glabella has the potential to serve as a socially-acceptable capture device, requiring no user input or behavior changes during regular activities, and whose continuous measurements may prove informative to physicians as well as users’ self-tracking activities.},

 abstract = {We introduce Pixie, a novel, camera based two factor authentication solution for mobile and wearable devices. A quick and familiar user action of snapping a photo is sufficient for Pixie to simultaneously perform a graphical password authentication and a physical token based authentication, yet it does not require any expensive, uncommon hardware. Pixie establishes trust based on both the knowledge and possession of an arbitrary physical object readily accessible to the user, called trinket. Users choose their trinkets similar to setting a password, and authenticate by presenting the same trinket to the camera. The fact that the object is the trinket, is secret to the user. Pixie extracts robust, novel features from trinket images, and leverages a supervised learning classifier to effectively address inconsistencies between images of the same trinket captured in different circumstances. Pixie achieved a false accept rate below 0.09% in a brute force attack with 14.3 million authentication attempts, generated with 40,000 trinket images that we captured and collected from public datasets. We identify master images, that match multiple trinkets, and study techniques to reduce their impact. In a user study with 42 participants over 8 days in 3 sessions we found that Pixie outperforms text based passwords on memorability, speed, and user preference. Furthermore, Pixie was easily discoverable by new users and accurate under field use. Users were able to remember their trinkets 2 and 7 days after registering them, without any practice between the 3 test dates.},

So far, extracting fluctuation patterns has been time and cost-intensive. Using an in-the-wild approach with 12 participants, we evaluated three cognitive tasks regarding their adequacy as a mobile and economical assessment tool of diurnal changes in mental performance. Participants completed the five-minute test battery on their smartphones multiple times a day for a period of 1-2 weeks. Our results show that people’s circadian rhythm can be obtained under unregulated non-laboratory conditions. Along with this validation study, we release our test battery as an open source library for future work towards cognition-aware systems as well as a tool for psychological and medical research. We discuss ways of integrating the toolkit and possibilities for implicitly measuring performance variations in common applications. The ability to detect systematic patterns in alertness levels will allow cognition-aware systems to provide in-situ assistance in accordance with users’ current cognitive capabilities and limitations.},

 abstract = {Before a person suffering from a traumatic brain injury reaches a medical facility, measuring their pupillary light reflex (PLR) is one of the few quantitative measures a clinician can use to predict their outcome. We propose PupilScreen, a smartphone app and accompanying 3D-printed box that combines the repeatability, accuracy, and precision of a clinical device with the ubiquity and convenience of the penlight test that clinicians regularly use in emergency situations. The PupilScreen app stimulates the patient's eyes using the smartphone's flash and records the response using the camera. The PupilScreen box, akin to a head-mounted virtual reality display, controls the eyes' exposure to light. The recorded video is processed using convolutional neural networks that track the pupil diameter over time, allowing for the derivation of clinically relevant measures. We tested two different network architectures and found that a fully convolutional neural network was able to track pupil diameter with a median error of 0.30 mm. We also conducted a pilot clinical evaluation with six patients who had suffered a TBI and found that clinicians were almost perfect when separating unhealthy pupillary light reflexes from healthy ones using PupilScreen alone.},

 abstract = {Active and passive sensing technologies are providing powerful mechanisms to track, model, and understand a range of health behaviors and well-being states. Despite yielding rich, dense and high fidelity data, current sensing technologies often require highly engineered study designs and persistent participant compliance, making them difficult to scale to large populations and to data acquisition tasks spanning extended time periods. This paper situates social media as a new passive, unobtrusive sensing technology. We propose a semi-supervised machine learning framework to combine small samples of data gathered through active sensing, with large-scale social media data to infer mood instability (MI) in individuals. Starting from a theoretically-grounded measure of MI obtained from mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), we show that our model is able to infer MI in a large population of Twitter users with 96% accuracy and F-1 score. Additionally, we show that, our model predicts self-identifying Twitter users with bipolar and borderline personality disorder to exhibit twice the likelihood of high MI, compared to that in a suitable control. We discuss the implications and the potential for integrating complementary sensing capabilities to address complex research challenges in precision medicine.},

We present Aili, a table lamp reconstructing a 3D hand skeleton in real time, requiring neither cameras nor on-body sensing devices. Aili consists of an LED panel in a lampshade and a few low-cost photodiodes embedded in the lamp base. To reconstruct a hand skeleton, Aili combines 2D binary blockage maps from vantage points of different photodiodes, which describe whether a hand blocks light rays from individual LEDs to all photodiodes. Empowering a table lamp with sensing capability, Aili can be seamlessly integrated into the existing environment. Relying on such low-level cues, Aili entails lightweight computation and is inherently privacy-preserving. We build and evaluate an Aili prototype. Results show that Aili’s algorithm reconstructs a hand pose within 7.2 ms on average, with 10.2° mean angular deviation and 2.5-mm mean translation deviation in comparison to Leap Motion. We also conduct user studies to examine the privacy issues of Leap Motion and solicit feedback on Aili’s privacy protection.

External cryptographic hardware solves this issue, but is currently only used for two-factor authentication and not for communication encryption. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate an architecture for NFC-based cryptography on Android. Our high-level API provides cryptographic operations without requiring knowledge of public-key cryptography. By developing OpenKeychain, we were able to roll out this architecture for more than 100,000 users. It provides encryption for emails, messaging, and a password manager. We provide a threat model, NFC performance measurements, and discuss their impact on our architecture design. As an alternative form factor to smart cards, we created the prototype of an NFC signet ring. To evaluate the UI components and form factors, a lab study with 40 participants at a large company has been conducted. We measured the time required by the participants to set up the system and reply to encrypted emails. These measurements and a subsequent interview indicate that our NFC-based solutions are more user friendly in comparison to traditional password-protected keys.},

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a survey administered by clinicians to evaluate symptom severity in schizophrenia. The CrossCheck symptom prediction system is capable of tracking schizophrenia symptoms based on BPRS using passive sensing from mobile phones. We present results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive sensing data, self-reports, and clinician administered 7-item BPRS surveys are collected from 36 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-12 months. We show that our system can predict a symptom scale score based on a 7-item BPRS within ±1.45 error on average using automatically tracked behavioral features from phones (e.g., mobility, conversation, activity, smartphone usage, the ambient acoustic environment) and user supplied self-reports. Importantly, we show our system is also capable of predicting an individual BPRS score within ±1.59 error purely based on passive sensing from phones without any self-reported information from outpatients. Finally, we discuss how well our predictive system reflects symptoms experienced by patients by reviewing a number of case studies.},

TraceMatch is a novel technique where the interface displays available controls as circular widgets with orbiting targets, and where users can trigger a control by mimicking the displayed motion. The technique uses computer vision to detect circular motion as a uniform type of input, but is highly appropriable as users can produce matching motion with any part of their body. We present three studies that investigate input performance with different parts of the body, user preferences, and spontaneous choice of movements for input in realistic application scenarios. The results show that users can provide effective input with their head, hands and while holding objects, that multiple controls can be effectively distinguished by the difference in presented phase and direction of movement, and that users choose and switch modes of input seamlessly.},

However, these previous works fail to characterize the fine-grained evolution of an event and the rich correlations among posts. The semantic associations among the multi-modal data in posts are also not investigated as a means to enhance the summarization performance. To address these issues, this study presents CrowdStory, which aims to characterize an event as a fine-grained, evolutionary, and correlation-rich storyline. A crowd-powered event model and a generic event storyline generation framework are first proposed, based on which a multi-clue--based approach to fine-grained event summarization is presented. The implicit human intelligence (HI) extracted from visual contents and community interactions is then used to identify inter-clue associations. Finally, a cross-media mining approach to selective visual story presentation is proposed. The experiment results indicate that, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, CrowdStory enables fine-grained event summarization (e.g., dynamic evolution) and correctly identifies up to 60% strong correlations (e.g., causality) of clues. The cross-media approach shows diversity and relevancy in visual data selection.},

Previous studies have explored other sensing methods, including vision-, RF-, mobile-, and acoustic-based methods. They often require specific sensing conditions, including line-of-sight, high sensor density, and carrying wearable devices. Vibration-based methods, on the other hand, provide easy-to-install sparse sensing and utilize gait to distinguish different individuals. However, the challenge for these methods is that the signals are sensitive to the gait variations caused by different walking speeds and the floor variations caused by structural heterogeneity. We present FootprintID, a vibration-based approach that achieves robust pedestrian identification. The system uses vibration sensors to detect footstep-induced vibrations. It then selects vibration signals and classifiers to accommodate sensing variations, taking step location and frequency into account. We utilize the physical insight on how individual step signal changes with walking speeds and introduce an iterative transductive learning algorithm (ITSVM) to achieve robust classification with limited labeled training data. When trained only on the average walking speed and tested on different walking speeds, FootprintID achieves up to 96% accuracy and a 3X improvement in extreme speeds compared to the Support Vector Machine. Furthermore, it achieves up to 90% accuracy (1.5X improvement) in uncontrolled experiments.},

In this paper, we exploit multi-context data to construct effective features and propose a method called CEMENT (Cost-sensitive sEmi-supervised personalized seMantic place labEl recogNiTion). On one hand, CEMENT is cost-sensitive, and it calculates misclassification costs according to the semantic similarity between place labels.

In this paper, we propose Interaction-based Power Transfer (IPT): a novel power scheme for power-as-needed devices (i.e., devices that only require power during interaction). IPT allows for the removal of built-in batteries on these devices, and to instead be powered up through direct contact interaction with the user (e.g. gripping a mouse, holding a pen). We prove the concept and show the potential of IPT through our TouchPower prototype. TouchPower transfers on-body power to off-body power-as-needed devices through contact between electrodes on a glove worn by the user and those on the target device during the interaction process. We design TouchPower to automatically detect the contact topology at runtime to supply power accordingly, and place electrodes on the glove so that TouchPower is compatible with various interactions with different objects. We also show the methodology of placing electrodes on the device-end, and evaluate it on a mouse and a remote controller. Results show that during interaction, TouchPower is able to provide stable power supply to these devices with only a small sacrifice in regards to interaction naturalness. At last we demonstrate six applications of TouchPower, and discuss the limitations and potential of TouchPower and IPT systems.},

 abstract = {Electric muscle stimulation (EMS) can enable mobile force feedback, support pedestrian navigation, or confer object affordances. To date, however, EMS is limited by two interlinked problems. (1) EMS is low resolution -- achieving only coarse movements and constraining opportunities for exploration. (2) EMS requires time consuming, expert calibration -- confining these interaction techniques to the lab. EMS arrays have been shown to increase stimulation resolution, but as calibration complexity increases exponentially as more electrodes are used, we require heuristics or automated procedures for successful calibration. We explore the feasibility of using electromyography (EMG) to auto-calibrate high density EMS arrays. We determine regions of muscle activity during human-performed gestures, to inform stimulation patterns for EMS-performed gestures. We report on a study which shows that auto-calibration of a 60-electrode array is feasible: achieving 52% accuracy across six gestures, with 82% accuracy across our best three gestures. By highlighting the electrode-array calibration problem, and presenting a first exploration of a potential solution, this work lays the foundations for high resolution, wearable and, perhaps one day, ubiquitous EMS beyond the lab.},

The basic idea is to scan the body with a radar sensor and to compute the reflection profile: the amount of energy that reflects back from each part of the body. Many people have different body shapes even if they have the same height, weight, or width, which makes body shape a stronger biometric. We built a proof-of-concept system called FormaTrack to test this approach, and evaluate using eight participants of varying height and weight. We collected over 2800 observations while capturing a wide range of factors such as clothing, hats, shoes, and backpacks. Results show that FormaTrack can achieve a precision, recall, direction and identity accuracy (over all possible groups of 2 people) of 100%, 99.86%, 99.7% and 95.3% respectively. Results indicate that FormaTrack can achieve over 99% tracking accuracy with 2 people in a home with 5 or more rooms.},

 abstract = {Smartphone app developers often access and use privacy-sensitive data to create apps with rich and meaningful interactions. However, it can be challenging for auditors and end-users to know what granularity of data is being used and how, thereby hindering assessment of potential risks. Furthermore, developers lack easy ways of offering transparency to users regarding how personal data is processed, even if their intentions are to make their apps more privacy friendly. To address these challenges, we introduce PrivacyStreams, a functional programming model for accessing and processing personal data as a stream. PrivacyStreams is designed to make it easy for developers to make use of personal data while simultaneously making it easier to analyze how that personal data is processed and what granularity of data is actually used. We present the design and implementation of PrivacyStreams, as well as several user studies and experiments to demonstrate its usability, utility, and support for privacy.},

 abstract = {Quality assessment in cricket is a complex task that is performed by understanding the combination of individual activities a player is able to perform and by assessing how well these activities are performed. We present a framework for inexpensive and accessible, automated recognition of cricketing shots. By means of body-worn inertial measurement units, movements of batsmen are recorded, which are then analysed using a parallelised, hierarchical recognition system that automatically classifies relevant categories of shots as required for assessing batting quality. Our system then generates meaningful visualisations of key performance parameters, including feet positions, attack/defence, and distribution of shots around the ground. These visualisations are the basis for objective skill assessment thereby focusing on specific personal improvement points as identified through our system. We evaluated our framework through a deployment study where 6 players engaged in batting exercises. Based on the recorded movement data we could automatically identify 20 classes of unique batting shot components with an average F1-score greater than 88%. This analysis is the basis for our detailed analysis of our study participants’ skills. Our system has the potential to rival expensive vision-based systems but at a fraction of the cost.},

We developed an Android application that linked to a wearable heart rate sensor and allowed for the direct sharing and real-time broadcasting of users’ heart rate via text messaging. We deployed this application in a two-week field study to investigate the contextual triggers, perceptions, and consequences of users’ sharing behaviors. The study (N=13) utilized a combination of Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) and qualitative interviews to discover the situations in which users were more or less likely to share their heart rate with contacts, and the subsequent interactions that occurred after sharing. The results revealed that participants used heart rate sharing as a means to express emotions and provide daily updates, as well as simply a novel and playful form of communication. They reported a variety of communicative consequences of their sharing as well as specific logistical and psychological barriers to sharing. The implications of these results for the design of expressive biosignal sharing systems for supporting positive social interactions are discussed.},

 abstract = {Continuous audio analysis from embedded and mobile devices is an increasingly important application domain. More and more, appliances like the Amazon Echo, along with smartphones and watches, and even research prototypes seek to perform multiple discriminative tasks simultaneously from ambient audio; for example, monitoring background sound classes (e.g., music or conversation), recognizing certain keywords (‘Hey Siri' or ‘Alexa'), or identifying the user and her emotion from speech. The use of deep learning algorithms typically provides state-of-the-art model performances for such general audio tasks. However, the large computational demands of deep learning models are at odds with the limited processing, energy and memory resources of mobile, embedded and IoT devices. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel deep learning modeling and optimization framework that specifically targets this category of embedded audio sensing tasks. Although the supported tasks are simpler than the task of speech recognition, this framework aims at maintaining accuracies in predictions while minimizing the overall processor resource footprint. The proposed model is grounded in multi-task learning principles to train shared deep layers and exploits, as input layer, only statistical summaries of audio filter banks to further lower computations. We find that for embedded audio sensing tasks our framework is able to maintain similar accuracies, which are observed in comparable deep architectures that use single-task learning and typically more complex input layers. Most importantly, on an average, this approach provides almost a 2.1× reduction in runtime, energy, and memory for four separate audio sensing tasks, assuming a variety of task combinations.},

In this paper, for the first time, we carry out a causality study to investigate the causal links between users’ emotional states and their interaction with mobile phones, which could provide valuable information to practitioners and researchers. The analysis is based on a dataset collected in-the-wild. We recorded 5,118 mood reports from 28 users over a period of 20 days. Our results show that users’ emotions have a causal impact on different aspects of mobile phone interaction. On the other hand, we can observe a causal impact of the use of specific applications, reflecting the external users’ context, such as socializing and traveling, on happiness and stress level. This study has profound implications for the design of interactive mobile systems since it identifies the dimensions that have causal effects on users’ interaction with mobile phones and vice versa. These findings might lead to the design of more effective computing systems and services that rely on the analysis of the emotional state of users, for example for marketing and digital health applications.},

 abstract = {Touch-based communication offers a direct and intuitive way for users to initiate and control data transfer when using tangible and ubiquitous interfaces. However, this requires that each interactive device be instrumented with a dedicated radio transmitter, which limits many applications. While not all devices have radio hardware, all devices do emit small amounts of electromagnetic noise in the form of EMI. We argue that if properly modulated these electromagnetic emissions can be used as an untapped communication channel capable of transmitting arbitrary data. To enable this, a spread spectrum frequency shift keying modulation scheme has been developed to encode data onto the device’s EMI. When the device is touched by a user, the data encoded EMI signal travels through their body and into our custom wrist band, consisting of a single op-amp and MCU. Our results show that we are able to turn electronic primitives such as LEDs, buttons, I/O lines, LCD screens, motors and power supplies into radio transmitters capable of touch communication. Effective data rates range from 5.8Kbps to 22 bit per image depending on the primitive used. To demonstrate this new communication technique, we develop several interactive experiences where users can retrieve complex information such as the function of buttons on a device, directions embedded into a LCD screen, and simplified device pairing. Ultimately, EM-Comm enables nearly any electronic device to be turned into a touch-based radio transmitter with only a software upgrade.},

@article{Kim:2017:TSB:3139486.3134650,
 abstract = {The interruptions people experience may be initiated from digital devices but also from oneself, an action which is termed “self-interruption.” Prior work mostly focused on understanding work-related self-interruptions and designing tools for mitigating them in work contexts. However, self-interruption to off-tasks (e.g., viewing social networking sites, and playing mobile games) has received little attention in the HCI community thus far. We conducted a formative study about self-interruptions to off-tasks and coping strategies in multi-device working environments. Off-task usage was considered a serious roadblock to productivity, and yet, the habitual usage and negative triggers made it challenging to manage off-task usage. To mitigate these concerns, we developed “PomodoLock,” a self-interruption management tool that allows users voluntarily to set a timer for a fixed period, during which it selectively blocks interruption sources across multiple devices. To understand the effect of restricting access to self-interruptive sources such as applications and websites, we conducted a three-week field trial (n=40) where participants were asked to identify disrupting apps and sites to be blocked, but the multi-device blocking feature was only provided to the experimental group. Our study results showed the perceived coercion and the stress of the experimental group were lower despite its behavioral restriction with multi-device blocking. Qualitative study results from interviews and surveys confirm that multi-device blocking significantly reduced participants’ mental effort for managing self-interruptions, thereby leading to a reduction in the overall stress level. The findings suggest that when the coerciveness of behavioral restriction is appropriately controlled, coercive design can positively assist users in achieving their goals.},

 abstract = {Homes located on tribal lands, particularly in rural areas of the United States, continue to lack access to broadband Internet and cellular connectivity [19]. Inspired by previous observations of community content similarity in tribal networks, we propose FiDO, a community-based Web browsing and content delivery system that takes advantage of user mobility, opportunistic connectivity, and collaborative filtering to provide relevant Web content to members of disconnected households via opportunistic contact with cellular base stations during a daily commute. We evaluate FiDO using trace-driven simulations with network usage data collected from a tribal-operated ISP that serves the Coeur d’Alene Indian Reservation in Western Idaho. By collecting data about household Web preferences and applying a collaborative filtering technique based on the Web usage patterns of the surrounding reservation community, we are able to opportunistically browse the Web on behalf of members of disconnected households, providing an average of 69.4 Web pages (all content from a specific URL, e.g., “http://gis.cdatribe-nsn.gov/LandBuyBack/”) crawled from 73% of their top 10 most visited Web domains (e.g., “cdatribe-nsn.gov” or “cnn.com/”) per day. Moreover, this content is able to be fetched and pushed to users even when the opportunistic data rate is limited to an average of only 0.99 Mbps (σ = 0.24 Mbps) and the daily opportunistic connection time is an average of 45.9 minutes (σ = 2.3 minutes). Additionally, we demonstrate a hybrid “search and browse” approach that allocates a percentage of opportunistic resources to the download of user-specified content. By dedicating only 10% of opportunistic windows of connectivity to the download of social media content, 51% of households were able to receive all of their daily expected social media content in addition to an average of 55.3 Web pages browsed on their behalf from an average of 4 different Web domains. Critically, we demonstrate the feasibility of a collaborative and community-based Web browsing model that extends access to Web content across the last mile(s) using existing infrastructure and rural patterns of mobility.},

 abstract = {Many of today's mobile products and services engage their users proactively via push notifications. However, such notifications are not always delivered at the right moment, therefore not meeting products' and users' expectations. To address this challenge, we aim at developing an intelligent mobile system that automatically infers moments in which users are open to engage with suggested content. To inform the development of such a system, we carried out a field study with 337 mobile phone users. For 4 weeks, participants ran a study application on their primary phones. They were tasked to frequently report their current mood via a notification-administered experience-sampling questionnaire. In this study, however, we analyze whether they voluntarily engaged with content that we offered at the bottom of that questionnaire. In addition, the study app logged a wide range of data related to their phone use. Based on 120 Million phone-use events and 78,930 questionnaire notifications, we build a machine-learning model that before delivering a notification predicts whether a participant will click on the notification and subsequently engage with the offered content. When compared to a naïve baseline, which emulates current non-intelligent engagement strategies, our model achieves 66.6% higher success rate in its predictions. If the model also considers the user's past behavior, predictions improve 5-fold over the baseline. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for building an intelligent service that identifies opportune moments for proactive user engagement, while, at the same time, reduces the number of undesirable interruptions.},

 abstract = {Distant emotion recognition (DER) extends the application of speech emotion recognition to the very challenging situation that is determined by variable speaker to microphone distances. The performance of conventional emotion recognition systems degrades dramatically as soon as the microphone is moved away from the mouth of the speaker. This is due to a broad variety of effects such as background noise, feature distortion with distance, overlapping speech from other speakers, and reverberation. This paper presents a novel solution for DER, addressing the key challenges by identification and deletion of features from consideration which are significantly distorted by distance, creating a novel, called Emo2vec, feature modeling and overlapping speech filtering technique, and the use of an LSTM classifier to capture the temporal dynamics of speech states found in emotions. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on two acted datasets (with artificially generated distance effect) as well as on a new emotional dataset of spontaneous family discussions with audio recorded from multiple microphones placed in different distances. Our solution achieves an average 91.6%, 90.1% and 89.5% accuracy for emotion happy, angry and sad, respectively, across various distances which is more than a 16% increase on average in accuracy compared to the best baseline method.},

We conducted a study on self-experimentation with two cohorts of students, where a total of 34 students performed a self-experiment of their choice. In the first cohort, students were given only two restrictions: a specific number of variables to track and a set duration for the study. The findings from this cohort helped us generate concrete guidelines for running a self-experiment, and use them as the format for the next cohort. A second cohort of students used these guidelines to conduct their own self-experiments in a more structured manner. Based on the findings from both cohorts, we propose a set of guidelines for running successful self-experiments that address the pitfalls encountered by students in the study, such as inadequate study design and analysis methods.

 abstract = {Indoor human tracking is fundamental to many real-world applications such as security surveillance, behavioral analysis, and elderly care. Previous solutions usually require dedicated device being carried by the human target, which is inconvenient or even infeasible in scenarios such as elderly care and break-ins. However, compared with device-based tracking, device-free tracking is particularly challenging because the much weaker reflection signals are employed for tracking. The problem becomes even more difficult with commodity Wi-Fi devices, which have limited number of antennas, small bandwidth size, and severe hardware noise. In this work, we propose IndoTrack, a device-free indoor human tracking system that utilizes only commodity Wi-Fi devices. IndoTrack is composed of two innovative methods: (1) Doppler-MUSIC is able to extract accurate Doppler velocity information from noisy Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) samples; and (2) Doppler-AoA is able to determine the absolute trajectory of the target by jointly estimating target velocity and location via probabilistic co-modeling of spatial-temporal Doppler and AoA information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IndoTrack can achieve a 35cm median error in human trajectory estimation, outperforming the state-of-the-art systems and provide accurate location and velocity information for indoor human mobility and behavioral analysis.},

@article{Carek:2017:SWC:3139486.3130905,
 abstract = {The current norm for measuring blood pressure (BP) at home is using an automated BP cuff based on oscillometry. Despite providing a viable and familiar method of tracking BP at home, oscillometric devices can be both cumbersome and inaccurate with the inconvenience of the hardware typically limiting measurements to once or twice per day. To address these limitations, a wrist-watch BP monitor was developed to measure BP through a simple maneuver: holding the watch against the sternum to detect micro-vibrations of the chest wall associated with the heartbeat. As a pulse wave propagates from the heart to the wrist, an accelerometer and optical sensor on the watch measure the travel time -- pulse transit time (PTT) -- to estimate BP. In this paper, we conducted a study to test the accuracy and repeatability of our device. After calibration, the diastolic pressure estimations reached a root-mean-square error of 2.9 mmHg. The watch-based system significantly outperformed (p<0.05) conventional pulse arrival time (PAT) based wearable blood pressure estimations -- the most commonly used method for wearable BP sensing in the existing literature and commercial devices. Our device can be a convenient means for wearable BP monitoring outside of clinical settings in both health-conscious and hypertensive populations.},

@article{Mehrotra:2017:URP:3139486.3131901,
 abstract = {User interaction patterns with mobile apps and notifications are generally complex due to the many factors involved. However a deep understanding of what influences them can lead to more acceptable applications that are able to deliver information at the right time. In this paper, we present for the first time an in-depth analysis of interaction behavior with notifications in relation to the location and activity of users. We conducted an in-situ study for a period of two weeks to collect more than 36,000 notifications, 17,000 instances of application usage, 77,000 location samples, and 487 days of daily activity entries from 26 students at a UK university. Our results show that users’ attention towards new notifications and willingness to accept them are strongly linked to the location they are in and in minor part to their current activity. We consider both users’ receptivity and attentiveness, and we show that different response behaviors are associated to different locations. These findings are fundamental from a design perspective since they allow us to understand how certain types of places are linked to specific types of interaction behavior. This information can be used as a basis for the development of novel intelligent mobile applications and services.},

@article{Brewer:2017:RRE:3139486.3130903,
 abstract = {Digital reminder systems typically use time and place as triggers to remind people to perform activities. In this paper, we investigate how digital reminder systems could better support the process of remembering in a wider range of situations. We report findings from a survey and one-week diary study, which reveal that people want to remember to perform a broad spectrum of activities in the future, many of which cannot be supported by simple time- and location-based reminders. In addition to these examples of prospective memory, or ‘remembering intentions’ [53], we also find that people want support in ‘retrieving’ [53] information and details, especially those encountered through social interactions or intended for use in conversations with others. Drawing on our analysis of what people want to remember and how they try to support this, we draw implications for the design of intelligent reminder systems such as digital assistants (e.g. Microsoft’s Cortana) and smart speaker systems (e.g. Amazon Echo), and highlight the possibilities afforded by drawing on conversation and giving material form to digital reminders.},

 abstract = {We have developed a system for automatic facial expression recognition running on Google Glass, delivering real-time social cues to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The system includes multiple mechanisms to engage children and their parents, who administer this technology within the home. We completed an at-home design trial with 14 families that used the learning aid over a 3-month period. We found that children with ASD generally respond well to wearing the system at home and opt for the most expressive feedback choice. We further evaluated app usage, facial engagement, and model accuracy. We found that the device can act as a powerful training aid when used periodically in the home, that interactive video content from wearable therapy sessions should be augmented with sufficient context about the content to produce long-term engagement, and that the design of wearable systems for children with ASD should be heavily dependent on the functioning level of the child. We contribute general design implications for developing wearable aids used by children with ASD and other behavioral disorders as well as their parents during at-home parent-administered therapy sessions.},

@article{Chitkara:2017:TAR:3139486.3132029,
 abstract = {The enormous popularity of smartphones, their rich sensing capabilities, and the data they have about their users have lead to millions of apps being developed and used. However, these capabilities have also led to numerous privacy concerns. Platform manufacturers, as well as researchers, have proposed numerous ways of mitigating these concerns, primarily by providing fine-grained visibility and privacy controls to the user on a per-app basis. In this paper, we show that this per-app permission approach is suboptimal for many apps, primarily because most data accesses occur due to a small set of popular third-party libraries which are common across multiple apps. To address this problem, we present the design and implementation of ProtectMyPrivacy (PmP) for Android, which can detect critical contextual information at runtime when privacy-sensitive data accesses occur. In particular, PmP infers the purpose of the data access, i.e. whether the data access is by a third-party library or by the app itself for its functionality. Based on crowdsourced data, we show that there are in fact a set of 30 libraries which are responsible for more than half of private data accesses. Controlling sensitive data accessed by these libraries can therefore be an effective mechanism for managing their privacy. We deployed our PmP app to 1,321 real users, showing that the number of privacy decisions that users have to make are significantly reduced. In addition, we show that our users are better protected against data leakage when using our new library-based blocking mechanism as compared to the traditional app-level permission mechanisms.},
