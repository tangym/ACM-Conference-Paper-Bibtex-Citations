Although hand shapes can express various meanings with small gestures, utilization of hand shapes as an interface is rare in domestic use. That is because a concise recognition method has not been established. To recognize hand shapes anywhere with no stress on the user, we developed a wearable wrist contour sensor device and a recognition system. In the system, features, such as sum of gaps, were extracted from wrist contours. We conducted a classification test of eight hand shapes, and realized approximately 70% classification rate.},

In contrast with existing stationary or outdoor air quality sensing systems, MAQS users carry portable, indoor location tracking sensors that provide personalized IAQ information.

MAQS has been deployed and evaluated via user study. Detailed evaluation results demonstrate that MAQS supports accurate personalized IAQ monitoring and quantitative analysis with high energy efficiency.},

Beyond simply a place to consume food, the dining room is a social hub where family members meet and share experiences. Yet busy lifestyles can make it difficult to spend social time with your family. To provide a new solution for family bonding, this paper presents the CoDine system, a dining table embedded with interactive subsystems that augment and transport the experience of communal family dining to create a sense of coexistence among remote family members. CoDine connects people in different locations through shared dining activities: gesture-based screen interaction, mutual food serving, ambient pictures on an animated tablecloth, and the transportation of edible messages. Rather than focusing on functionality or efficiency, CoDine aims to provide people with an engaging interactive dining experience through enriched multi-sensory communication.},

The system consists of wireless tags and a high-speed projector (DMD Discovery 3000), operating in 8kHz, attached on mobility platform. The projector transmits structured light patterns that contain different information in each pixel. Wireless tags can recognize their own locations in projected area by receiving structured light patterns projected from the projector. Since 3D coordinates of individual tag is stored in the system, projection point is estimated with 3D coordinates and pixel coordinates of each tag in projected area. According to the estimated position and orientation, augmented reality content is superimposed. The set of structured light patterns are projected in sufficient speed that human eye can only perceive the superimposed content. We have also evaluated the accuracy of superimposing augmented reality content on real world from moving projection points.},

 abstract = {Much research in ubiquitous computing assumes that a user's phone will be always on and at-hand, for collecting user context and for communicating with a user. Previous work with the previous generation of mobile phones has shown that such an assumption is false. Here, we investigate whether this assumption about users' proximity to their mobile phones holds for a new generation of mobile phones, smart phones. We conduct a data collection field study of 28 smart phone owners over a period of 4 weeks. We show that in fact this assumption is still false, with the within arm's reach proximity being true close to 50% of the time, similar to the earlier work. However, we also show that smart phone proximity within the same room (arm+room) as the user is true almost 90% of the time. We discuss the reasons for these phone proximities and the implications of this on the development of mobile phone applications, particularly those that collect user and environmental context, and delivering notification to users. We also show that we can accurately predict the proximity at the arm level and arm+room level with 75 and 83% accuracy, respectively, with features simple to collect and model on a mobile phone. Further we show that for several individuals who are almost always within the arm+room level, we can predict this level with over 90% accuracy.},

It uses NFC, which has fast setup time but low bandwidth, to exchange both network settings and the media URI, then programmatically configures wireless interfaces to securely connect and transfer the media. Specifically, we propose NFC+Hotspot, which combines NFC with secure Wi-Fi Hotspot mode. It is secure, easy to use, and significantly faster than existing sharing methods. We evaluated various sharing methods, in 2 categories, for both photo and video: 1. Direct Transfer (e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Hotspot), and 2. NFC+ Direct Transfer. Experimental results show that our NFC+Hotspot approach has the fastest photo and video sharing performance, with improvement ranging from 1.8x-3.7x for 1MB photo and 0.7x -- 6.9x for 1 minute HD video compared to (non-NFC+) Direct Transfer methods.},

 abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming ubiquitous. People use their phones as a personal concierge discovering and making decisions anywhere and anytime. Understanding user intent on the go therefore becomes important for task completion on the phone. While existing efforts have predominantly focused on understanding the explicit user intent expressed by a textual or voice query, this paper presents an approach to context-aware and personalized entity recommendation which understands the implicit intent without any explicit user input on the phone. The approach, highly motivated from a large-scale mobile click-through analysis, is able to rank both the entity types and the entities within each type (here an entity is a local business, e.g., "I love sushi," while an entity type is a category, e.g., "restaurant"). The recommended entity types and entities are relevant to both user context (past behaviors) and sensor context (time and geo-location). Specifically, it estimates the generation probability of an entity by a given user conditioned on the current context in a probabilistic framework. A random-walk propagation is then employed to refine the estimated probability by mining the temporal patterns among entities. We deploy a recommendation application based on the proposed approach on Window Phone 7 devices. We evaluate recommendation performance on 10 thousand mobile clicks, as well as user experience through subjective user studies. We show that the application is effective to facilitate the exploration and discovery of surroundings for mobile users.},

To address this issue, we have implemented Sundroid. Sundroid measures the incident UV radiation using a body-worn sensing unit that communicates wirelessly with the user's smartphone. The phone thereby acts as a user interface to present the measured data in an intuitive manner, and to notify the user once a critical amount of sunlight has been reached.

We look at how these strategies affect compliance, data quality, and retention, and show that when used carefully, micro-payments can be highly beneficial. We find that data quality is different across the micro-incentive schemes we experimented with, and therefore the incentive strategy should be chosen with care. We think that adaptive micro-payment based incentives can be used to successfully incentivize future studies at much lower cost to the study designer, while ensuring high compliance, good data quality, and lower retention issues.},

Similar to many interactive paper systems, MixPad adopts a mobile camera-projector unit to recognize paper documents, detect pen and finger gestures and provide visual feedback. Unlike these systems, MixPad allows using mice and keyboards to help users interact with fine-grained document content on paper (e.g. individual words and user-defined arbitrary regions), and to facilitate cross-media operations. For instance, to copy a document segment from paper to a laptop, one first points a finger of her non-dominant hand to the segment roughly, and then uses a mouse in her dominant hand to refine the selection and drag it to the laptop; she can also type text as a detailed comment on a paper document. This novel interaction paradigm combines the advantages of mice, keyboards, pens and fingers, and therefore enables rich digital functions on paper.},

 abstract = {On behalf of the organizing committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing. This is the third time the UbiComp conference series has come to Asia. This year's conference in Beijing, China, follows Seoul, Korea (2008) and Tokyo, Japan (2005). UbiComp is a conference that truly captures the wide variety of research activities in the diverse field of ubiquitous computing, encompassing research from, e.g., Human-Computer Interaction, Mobile Computing, Location and Sensing Technology, Machine Learning, Middleware and Systems, and Programming Models and Tools. September 2011 also marks a historic date in the history of Ubicomp. It is exactly 20 years from when Dr. Mark Weiser's historic article, "The Computer for the Twenty-First Century," appeared in Scientific American. This article is acclaimed for widely publicizing the idea of Ubicomp in the research community and setting the goals for the early years of the field. We will mark this historic occasion with a special panel in tribute to the late Dr. Weiser. Our panel of luminaries, including those who worked with Dr. Weiser at Xerox PARC, as well as his contemporaries who were influenced by his work at the time, will reminisce on Mark's predictions as well as present their view of where the field should move going forward. Each UbiComp conference represents a snapshot of our field, capturing the state-of-the-art in technology, the research challenges we are addressing, as well as the people that form the UbiComp community. Each year's proceedings represent an opportunity to learn about new areas and identify upcoming research opportunities, and this year is no exception. UbiComp 2011 continues the tradition of a single-track program that allows participants to experience the entire program in a variety of sessions, ranging from context awareness to location sharing, from home infrastructures to novel interactions, and from persuasive computing to sensing. This year our international Program Committee, composed of 28 of the leading researchers in the field, evaluated a record number of 302 submissions --- 234 full papers and 68 notes. Using a multi-phase review process, initially each submission was reviewed by at least one member of the PC and three or more external reviewers. Of the 302 submissions, 118 were evaluated by 1-2 additional PC members and discussed at a 2- day PC meeting held on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. In total, the Program Committee and 531 external reviewers spent countless hours to provide feedback to the authors through 1343 reviews. After this rigorous process, a total of 50 submissions --- 44 full papers and 6 notes --- were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 16.6%. We feel our selective review process has resulted in a high-quality set of published papers. A sub-committee discussed and selected five of the 50 accepted papers to be recognized in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. Of these five, one stood out as the best paper of UbiComp 2011. This year also sees a high quality adjunct program, accepting 23 demos, 7 videos, and 34 posters, for a total of 56 accepted adjunct papers out of 85 submissions (note that several accepted adjunct submissions appear in multiple categories, but are only counted once in the acceptance numbers). Continued from UbiComp 2010, we encouraged authors of accepted full papers and notes to also submit a poster, video, or demo of their work, to better engage the audience and stimulate discussion. To properly reflect the significance of the work represented in the adjunct program, these submissions also see a tighter integration in the main program, with video presentations interspersed with the technical presentations of the main track, and posters and demos presented during lunch breaks. The workshop program has 13 workshops that cover both traditional Ubicomp topics (e.g., context awareness, location-based services, mobile sensing, health, and design) and newer topics (e.g., crowdsourcing and urban computing). This year, we launched the first tutorial program in UbiComp conference history. We offered five tutorials by leading experts on the topics of activity recognition, Android development, evaluation, ubicomp research in the wild, and urban sensing. We also experimented with a new Visions of Ubicomp Film Contest. Last but not least, Jan Chipchase's keynote will offer a provocative look at the future of ubiquitous computing in new settings. We hope you find this year's program interesting, useful and enjoyable. Several organizations and people contributed to the success of UbiComp 2011 and we are grateful for their support. First, we would like to thank Tsinghua University for hosting and helping to organize UbiComp. We also appreciate the sponsorship of ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGMOBILE and ACM SIGSPATIAL. Finally, the conference could not occur without the kind financial support of our benefactors Microsoft Research, Shanda, NSFC, NSF, Qualcomm, Google, IGRS, HTC, Nokia, Intel, AutoDesk, Opzoon, and Telezoon.},

This marks the fourth time the UbiComp conference has being held in North America, following Orlando, Florida (2009), Orange County, California (2006), Seattle, Washington (2003) and Atlanta, Georgia (2001). UbiComp truly captures the wide variety of research activities in the diverse field of ubiquitous computing, encompassing research from, e.g., Human Computer Interaction, Mobile Computing, Location and Sensing Technology, Machine Learning, Middleware and Systems, and Programming Models and Tools. Each UbiComp conference represents a snapshot of our field, capturing the state-of-the-art in technology, the research challenges we are addressing, as well as the people that form the UbiComp community. Each year's proceedings represent an opportunity to learn about new areas and identify upcoming research opportunities, and this year is no exception. UbiComp 2012 builds upon the tradition by expanding to a dual-track technical program, while still allowing participants to experience the program in a variety of sessions, ranging from context awareness to location sharing, from smartphones to fixed infrastructures, from user experiences to novel interactions, and from persuasive computing to physiological sensing. This year our international Program Committee, composed of 45 of the leading researchers in the field of ubiquitous computing, evaluated 301 submissions - 223 full papers and 78 notes. Using a multi-phase review process, after quick-rejecting a small number of incomplete or off-topic submissions, each submission was initially reviewed by at least two members of the program committee and two or more external reviewers. Of the 301 submissions, 67 were evaluated by 1-3 additional PC members. After an online discussion, 11 submissions were auto-accepted and 93 submissions were chosen for further review and discussion at a 2-day PC meeting. In total, the Program Committee and 415 external reviewers spent countless hours to provide feedback to the authors through 1245 reviews. After this rigorous process, a record total of 58 submissions - 50 full papers and 8 notes - were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 19.3%. We are pleased to note this acceptance rate equals the highest in the fourteen-year history of the UbiComp conference thus far. We feel our selective review process has resulted in a high-quality set of published papers. A sub-committee discussed and selected 12 of the 58 accepted papers (equivalent to 4% of the submitted papers) to be recognized in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. Of these 12, 3 stood out as the best papers of UbiComp 2012 (equivalent to 1% of the submitted papers).},

First, we show that cellular handoff patterns on a given route are stable across a range of conditions and propose a way to measure stability within and between routes using a variant of Earth Mover's Distance. Second, we present two accurate classification algorithms for matching cellular handoff patterns to routes: one requires test drives on the routes while the other uses signal strength data collected by high-resolution scanners. Finally, we present an application of our algorithms for measuring relative volumes of traffic on routes leading into and out of a specific city, and validate our methods using statistics published by a state transportation authority.},

However, designing a successful availability-sharing system requires finding the right balance to maximize the benefits and reduce costs for both the interrupter and interruptee. The main challenges for finding such balance lie in the acquisition of availability information from the interruptee and its delivery to the interrupter. In this demonstration, we show how common technical approaches in ubicomp can address some of the problems typically encountered in availability sharing. We present InterruptMe, a novel availability sharing system that uses sensor information to calculate multiple availability measures for each interruptee and that delivers this information in the periphery of the interrupter's attention by using a projected peripheral display and monitoring implicit inputs to the system.},

 abstract = {Future ubiquitous home environments can contain 10s or 100s of devices. Ubiquitous services running on these devices (i.e. localizing users, routing, security algorithms) will commonly require an accurate location of each device. In order to obtain these locations, existing techniques require either a manual survey, active sound sources, or estimation using wireless radios. These techniques, however, need additional hardware capabilities and are intrusive to the user. Non-intrusive, automatic localization of ubiquitous computing devices in the home has the potential to greatly facilitate device deployments. This paper presents the PANDAA system, a zero-configuration spatial localization system for networked devices based on ambient sound sensing. After initial placement of the devices, ambient sounds, such as human speech, music, foot- steps, finger snaps, hand claps, or coughs and sneezes, are used to autonomously resolve the spatial relative arrangement of devices using trigonometric bounds and successive approximation. Using only time difference of arrival measurements as a bound for successive estimations, PANDAA is able to achieve an average of 0.17 meter accuracy for device location in the meeting room deployment.},

Both are used in a situation in which two users depart from different points simultaneously, but they want to reach common goal. One mode of navigation is used in a situation in which both users want to reach the goal independently. The navigation system calculates each route and arrival time for each user. If the two arrival times differ, then the system suggests another route with a dropping point such as a store or park to the user who will reach the goal earlier. The other navigation is used in a situation in which two users want to join somewhere before reaching a common goal. The navigation system suggests not only a juncture point, but also suggests routes from each departure point to the juncture point, and a route from the juncture point to the goal. We developed a prototype system using the city center of Wakayama as a test area. Using it, we evaluated the proposed navigations.},

Existing platforms for crowdsourcing, support specific activity types, such as micro-tasks on the Amazon's Mechanical Turk; and fall short of facilitating general mechanisms for setting up and maintaining crowd networks easily, flexibly and in a variety of domains. Building upon First International Workshop on Ubiquitous Crowdsourcing, in this edition we challenge researchers and practitioners to identify requirements for a platform for crowd computing, arising from experiences in deployment crowdsourcing applications, which engage crowd members as sensors, controllers and actuators in smart cities and environments. This workshop brings together researchers to produce a vision for the universal crowdsourcing platform, documenting it in a theme publication.},

We critically examine the current state of the art in cough detection, concluding that existing approaches expose private audio recordings of users and bystanders. We present a novel algorithm for detecting coughs from the audio stream of a mobile phone. Our system allows cough sounds to be reconstructed from the feature set, but prevents speech from being reconstructed intelligibly. We evaluate our algorithm on data collected in the wild and report an average true positive rate of 92% and false positive rate of 0.5%. We also present the results of two psychoacoustic experiments which characterize the tradeoff between the fidelity of reconstructed cough sounds and the intelligibility of reconstructed speech.},

However, the high deployment cost, low scalability and reuseability still remain to be the main roadblock for their wider application. Using human to monitor events can also be unreliable. Accordingly, we designed a ubiquitous wireless video surveillance system. This system uses wireless sensor nodes to detect pre-defined events and utilizes wireless mesh network to transmit high-quality video streams. Without cables, the deployment cost is significantly decreased. Different application users can also define various events and automatically receive notification and corresponding video streams when the events occur. In addition, mobile users, even when roaming, can access this system. In this demo, we introduce the hardware and software of this system and its implementation in our intelligent transportation system testbed.},

In-situ measurement of human behavior has the potential to overcome the short comings of gold-standard surveys that have been used for decades by the medical community. However, current sensing systems have mainly focused on tracking physical health; some have approximated aspects of mental health based on proximity measurements but have not been compared against medically accepted screening instruments. In this paper, we show the feasibility of a multi-modal mobile sensing system to simultaneously assess mental and physical health. By continuously capturing fine-grained motion and privacy-sensitive audio data, we are able to derive different metrics that reflect the results of commonly used surveys for assessing well-being by the medical community. In addition, we present a case study that highlights how errors in assessment due to the subjective nature of the responses could potentially be avoided by continuous mobile sensing.},

Applications like VoIP do not perform well under PSM mode however, due to their real-time nature, so the energy footprint is quite high. The challenge is to save energy while not affecting performance. In this paper we present SiFi: Silence prediction based WiFi energy adaptation. SiFi examines audio streams from phone calls and tracks when silence periods start and stop. This data is stored in a prediction model. Using this historical data, we predict the length of future silence periods and place the WiFi radio to sleep during these periods. We implement the design on an Android Smart phone and acheive 40% energy savings while maintaining high voice fidelity.},

Vision-based 3D modeling has only seen limited success in applications, as it faces many technical challenges that only a few experts understand, let alone solve. In this work we utilize (Kinect style) consumer depth cameras to enable non-expert users to scan their personal spaces into 3D models. We build a prototype mobile system for 3D modeling that runs in real-time on a laptop, assisting and interacting with the user on-the-fly. Color and depth are jointly used to achieve robust 3D registration. The system offers online feedback and hints, tolerates human errors and alignment failures, and helps to obtain complete scene coverage. We show that our prototype system can both scan large environments (50 meters across) and at the same time preserve fine details (centimeter accuracy). The capability of detailed 3D modeling leads to many promising applications such as accurate 3D localization, measuring dimensions, and interactive visualization.},

In two public installations (city street and public park) and a deployment with six everyday citizens, we invited stakeholders to playfully explore and actively participate in visualizing surrounding air quality. We also created a do-it-yourself (DIY) kit that includes a printed circuit board, electronic parts and instructions for building the air quality balloons. In a workshop, six non-expert users successfully assembled functional balloons, validating our technology as a DIY tool for public air quality visualization. Our deployments and workshop highlight play and spectacle as essential elements for public participation and activism. We outline design guidelines for future spectacle computing projects that engage stakeholders with environmental data and empower them to transform urban landscapes.},

To answer these questions we analyse the privacy policies of users of a real-time location sharing application, in which users actively shared their location with their contacts. The results show that users who are central to their network are more likely to reveal most about their whereabouts. Furthermore, we show that the friend most likely to know the whereabouts of a specific individual is the one with most common contacts and/or greatest number of contacts.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we describe LightWave, a sensing approach that turns ordinary compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs into sensors of human proximity. Unmodified CFL bulbs are shown to be sensitive proximity transducers when they are illuminated. This approach utilizes predictable variations in electromagnetic noise resulting from the change in impedance due to the proximity of a human body to the bulb. The electromagnetic noise can be sensed from any point along a home's electrical wiring. This allows users to perform gestures near any CFL lighting fixture, even when multiple lamps are operational. Gestures can be sensed using a single interface device plugged into any electrical outlet. We experimentally show that we can reliably detect hover gestures (waving a hand close to a lamp), touches on lampshades, and touches on the glass part of the bulb itself. Additionally, we show that touches anywhere along the body of a metal lamp can be detected. These basic detectable signals can then be combined to form complex gesture sequences for a variety of applications. We also show that CFLs can function as more general-purpose sensors for distributed human motion detection and ambient temperature sensing.},

To design tools that effectively assist self-reflection, we need to comprehensively understand what kinds of questions people have about their data, why they ask these questions, how they answer them with current tools, and what kinds of problems they encounter. To explore this, we conducted interviews with people who use various kinds of tools for personal informatics. We found six kinds of questions that people asked about their data. We also found that certain kinds of questions are more important at certain times, which we call phases. We identified two phases of reflection: Discovery and Maintenance.

Our system has been in continuous use for approximately 3 years. We reflect and draw lessons from how our user community has adopted and used the resulting public display network.

People are going to want everyday applications to have location-awareness that goes beyond simple numerical latitude and longitude. Loci is a new semantic location service layer that employs user feedback to bridge the gap between machine-learned and human-defined places. Advances in place learning techniques have provided us the tools to detect nearly 95% of the visits we make to places and the distances we travel. The difficulty of recovering the remaining 5% comes from designing parameters that work for every user in every place. Based on a user study with 29 participants over three weeks, we show that the level of user feedback required by the service is acceptable and most of the users are willing to provide help to improve their experiences with the service. Our results suggest that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve semantic location services, but requires well-timed prompting mechanisms to improve the quality of the feedback.},

This work introduces the "Social fMRI" --- a ubiquitous computing approach that enhances existing methodologies by combining extremely rich data collection in terms of signals, dimensionality, and throughput, together with the ability to conduct targeted experimental interventions with study populations. The proposed research aims to demonstrate the value of the Social fMRI approach via its first instantiation: The Friends and Family living laboratory study, in which a young-family residential community was transformed into a living laboratory for over a year. Using the highly fine-grained and unprecedented longitudinal dataset collected in the study, I aim to show how this approach allows us to gain insights on intricate social mechanisms and interpersonal relationships within the community in ways not possible with traditional approaches. In addition, the mobile-phone based sensing and intervention delivery system developed for this study --- a Social fMRI reference implementation --- is field-proven and robust enough to be reused by other researchers and developers as an open and extensible sensing platform.},

Providing intelligibility has been proposed to help explain to users how context-aware applications work in order to improve user impressions of them.

We conducted a large controlled study of a location-aware and a sound-aware application, investigating the impact of intelligibility on understanding, and user impression of applications with varying certainty. We found that intelligibility impacts user impressions, depending on the application's certainty and behavior appropriateness. Intelligibility is helpful for applications with high certainty, but it is harmful if applications behave appropriately, yet display low certainty.},

 abstract = {William James, the noted psychologist and philosopher, believed that smiling has a positive effect on our mind. James' view, which was confirmed by several psychological studies, was that we become happier when we laugh. In this paper, we propose a new digital appliance that encourages the act of smiling in our daily lives. This system is designed for people who may not always realize when they are in low spirits and/or have difficulty with smiling. In addition, we believe that this system will foster casual conversation and prompt communications with other people. Our appliance, called the HappinessCounter, combines visual smile recognition, user feedback, and network communication. We conducted two trials of the HappinessCounter system, the first with a single occupant and the second with a couple living together. The system had positive effects on user's mood and prompted communication among family members, thereby increasing their positive mood as well.},

A multimodal experience was created, comprising ambient sounds and narratives -- heard through headphones -- and an assortment of themed tactile objects, intended to be felt. In addition, audience members were each provided with a novel haptic device that was designed to enhance their discovery of a pitch-black space. An in the wild study of the cultural experience showed how blind and sighted audience members had different 'felt' experiences, but that neither was a lesser one. Furthermore, the haptic device was found to encourage enactive exploration and provide reassurance of the environment for both sighted and blind people, rather than acting simply as a navigation guide. We discuss the potential of using haptic feedback to create cultural experiences for both blind and sighted people; rethinking current utilitarian framing of it as assistive technology.},

@proceedings{Bardram:2010:1864349,
 abstract = {On behalf of the entire organizing committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 12th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing. After North America (2009) and Asia (2008), the UbiComp conference series returns again to Europe, to the vibrant port city of Copenhagen, Denmark. 2010 marks the 12th installment of a conference that truly captures the wide variety of research activities in the diverse field of ubiquitous computing, encompassing research from, e.g., Human Computer Interaction, Mobile Computing, Location and Sensing Technology, Middleware and Systems, and Programming Models and Tools. Each UbiComp conference represents a snapshot of our field, capturing the state-of-the-art in technology, the research challenges we are addressing, as well as the people that form the UbiComp community. Each year's proceedings represent an opportunity to learn about new areas and identify upcoming research opportunities, and this year is no exception. UbiComp 2010 continues the tradition of a single-track technical program that allows participants to experience the entire program in a variety of sessions, ranging from context awareness to location sharing, from home infrastructures to novel interactions, and from persuasive computing to physiological sensing. This year our international Program Committee, composed of 26 of the leading researchers in the field of ubiquitous computing, evaluated 202 submissions - 152 full papers and 50 notes. Using a multi-phase review process, initially each submission was reviewed by at least one member of the program committee and two or more external reviewers. Of the 202 submissions, 131 were evaluated by 1-3 additional PC members. After an online discussion, 9 submissions were auto-accepted and 79 submissions were chosen for further review and discussion at a 2-day PC meeting. In total, the Program Committee and 301 external reviewers spent countless hours to provided feedback to the authors through 848 reviews. After this rigorous process, a total of 39 submissions - 32 full papers and 7 notes - were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 19.3%. We are pleased to note this acceptance rate is the highest in the twelve-year history of the Ubicomp conference thus far. We feel our selective review process has resulted in a high-quality set of published papers. A sub-committee discussed and selected five of the 39 accepted papers to be recognized in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. Of these five, one stood out as the best paper of Ubicomp 2010. This year also sees a significantly expanded adjunct program, accepting 18 demos (1 also as video), 26 posters (3 also as videos), and 10 videos (including the shared ones), making a total of 50 accepted adjunct papers out of 79 submissions. For the first time, we have actively encouraged authors of accepted full papers and notes to also submit a poster, video, or demo of their work, in order to better engage the audience and stimulate face to face discussions. To properly reflect the significance of the work represented in the adjunct program, these submissions also see a much tighter integration in the main program, with video presentations interspersed with the technical presentations of the main track, and posters and demos presented during breaks and the first day's welcome reception. The workshop program has more than doubled the number of workshops, featuring a record-breaking 14 scheduled workshops that cover both traditional UbiComp topics (e.g., context awareness, health, and design) and novel developments (e.g., crowdsourcing, e-energy, and urban computing). Last but not least, Morten Kyng's keynote on "Making dreams come true -- or how to avoid a living nightmare" will offer a critical look at the promises of ubiquitous computing and present design ideas for helping people make sense of this ever increasing technological environment.},

We deployed PreHeat in five homes, three in the US and two in the UK. In UK homes, we controlled heating on a per-room basis to enable further energy savings. We compared PreHeat's prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In UK homes PreHeat both saved gas and reduced MissTime (the time that the house was occupied but not warm). In US homes, PreHeat decreased MissTime by a factor of 6-12, while consuming a similar amount of gas. In summary, PreHeat enables more efficient heating while removing the need for users to program thermostat schedules.},

In this paper, we propose a Low Energy Assisted Positioning (LEAP) solution that carefully partitions the GPS signal processing pipeline and shifts delay tolerant position calculations to the cloud. The GPS receiver only needs to be on for less than a second to collect the sub-millisecond level propagation delay for each satellites signal. With a reference to a nearby object, such as a cell tower, the LEAP server can infer the rest of the information necessary to perform GPS position calculation. We analyze the accuracy and energy benefit of LEAP and use real user traces to show that LEAP can save up to 80% GPS energy consumption in typical trajectory-based service scenarios.},

 abstract = {A promising approach to location privacy is query obfuscation, which involves reporting k -- 1 false locations along with the real location. In this paper, we examine the level of privacy protection provided by the current query obfuscation techniques against adversarial location service providers. As a representative and realistic implementation of query obfuscation, we focus on SybilQuery. We present two types of attacks depending upon whether or not a short-term query history is available. When history is available, using machine learning, we were able to identify 93.67% of user trips, with only 2.02% of fake trips misclassified, for the security parameter k = 5. In the absence of history, we used trip correlations to form a smaller set of trips effectively increasing the user query identification probability from 20% to about 40%. Our work demonstrates that the use of aggregate statistical information alone is not sufficient to generate simulated trips. We identify areas for improvement in the existing query obfuscation techniques.},

 abstract = {The widespread adoption of automated fare collection (AFC) systems by public transport authorities around the world means that, increasingly, people carry and use passive sensors (embedded inside of public transit tickets) to record their daily movements. Unlike mobile phones, the records held by AFC systems provide a rich and detailed source of data about peoples' transport habits: times of travel, modalities, destinations, trip durations, and fares paid. In this work, we explore the extent that this data offers the possibility to both build and measure future of travel-based ubiquitous computing applications. We focus on two potential end-users: first, how travellers may be aided by feedback mechanisms in order to re-align misperceptions of their travel behaviour and leverage this data to change their habits. In particular, we analyse differences between 85 travellers' surveyed perceptions of their public transport habits and their actual usage of the system. Second, how transport authorities can use this data to measure and implement incentive mechanisms that produce the expected impact. We use anonymised AFC data to measure the extent that financial incentives implemented by London's transport authority (such as peak-hour fares and student discounts) correlate with measurable changes in millions of travellers' behaviours.},

To achieve the objective, firstly we group all the taxi trajectories crossing the same source destination cell-pair and represent each taxi trajectory as a sequence of symbols. Secondly, we propose an Isolation-Based Anomalous Trajectory (iBAT) detection method and verify with large scale taxi data that iBAT achieves remarkable performance (AUC>0.99, over 90% detection rate at false alarm rate of less than 2%). Finally, we demonstrate the potential of iBAT in enabling innovative applications by using it for taxi driving fraud detection and road network change detection.},

We present a field study of ten individuals who routinely work with living organisms such as plants, fish, reptiles and bees, and rely on these organisms as well as analog instruments and digital sensors to infer environmental conditions and inform future actions. Our findings offer a new perspective on everyday biomarkers, and we use the lens of organic and non-digital sensing to reflect on current sensing paradigms in ubiquitous computing. We conclude with three opportunity areas to help frame future work in ubiquitous sensing: (1) incorporating traditional technologies and living systems into ubiquitous sensing applications, (2) developing information technologies that teach new ways of 'seeing', and (3) supporting richer forms of metadata to unite stakeholders through their actions, interests and concerns.},

Communicating detailed tactile characteristics of virtual elements, however, requires complex electromechanical or electrostatic actuator setups. This increase in complexity makes tactile interfaces intricate, costly or poorly scalable. In order to provide sophisticated tactile sensations with simple actuator technology, we exploit a haptic psychophysical phenomenon called Phantom Sensation. We present a comparison of three standard tactile actuator technologies to see which one can recreate the Phantom Sensation with maximum effect. Our results show the way to a simple and scalable implementation of illusion-based tactile feedback for interactive surfaces.

An important yet missing contextual dimension is the cognitive context that comprises all aspects related to mental information processing, such as perception, memory, knowledge, or learning. In this work we investigate the feasibility of recognising visual memory recall. We use a recognition methodology that combines minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection (mRMR) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We validate the methodology in a dual user study with a total of fourteen participants looking at familiar and unfamiliar pictures from four picture categories: abstract, landscapes, faces, and buildings. Using person-independent training, we are able to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar abstract pictures with a top recognition rate of 84.3% (89.3% recall, 21.0% false positive rate) over all participants. We show that eye movement analysis is a promising approach to infer the cognitive context of a person and discuss the key challenges for the real-world implementation of eye-based cognition-aware systems.},

The system is based on a new conductive inkjet technology, which allows capacitive sensor electrodes and different types of RF antennas to be cheaply printed onto a roll of flexible substrate that may be many meters long. By deploying this surface on (or under) a floor it is possible to detect the presence and whereabouts of users through both passive and active capacitive coupling schemes. We have also incorporated GSM and NFC electromagnetic radiation sensing and piezoelectric pressure and vibration detection. We report on a number of experiments which evaluate sensing performance based on a 2.5m x 0.3m hardware test-bed. We describe some potential applications for this technology and highlight a number of improvements we have in mind.},

However, limited battery power is a big hindrance to the deployment of continuous sensing on mobile devices and without any intelligent sensor management, the battery lasts only few hours.

Previous works that use GPS/WiFi sampling are accurate but energy efficiency is low and does not improve over time. Learning from the human decision making process, we propose an energy-efficient trip detection framework that consists of two modes: The deliberation mode learns cell-id patterns using GPS/WiFi based localization methods; the intuition mode only uses cell-ids and learned patterns for trip detection; transition between the two modes is controlled by parameters that are also learned. We evaluated our framework using real-life traces of six people over five months. Our experiments demonstrate that its energy consumption decreases rapidly as users' activities manifest regularity over time.},

However, tracking becomes more complex when dealing with multiple small objects of similar form. We propose to use tangible mediators for integrating such objects to tabletops. This paper reports on our initial explorations of mediated tabletop interaction consisting of a mediator prototype and a design space definition. We built a mediator, the Rabbit, a device that translates thevalue of an RFID tag into a visual 2D code. The Rabbit rests on the interactive surface, holds the object, reads its passive RFID tag, and converts the read value into a 2D code that can be read by the DIT's built-in camera. When handling multiple objects, the Rabbit iterates through the generated 2D codes. Through a series of participatory activities with end users (molecular biologists), we collected initial feedback from participants and defined a design space for mediated tabletop interaction.},

 abstract = {With the rising popularity of social networks, people's locations are being used for providing rich mobile social services. We present a mobile social service in our office environment called Find & Connect. We use WiFi to record a user's position and allow users to efficiently find, reserve and manage office resources, like meeting rooms and desks, and easily connect to other colleagues through scheduled interactions like having a meeting and/or unscheduled yet implicit interactions like ephemeral encounters. We then describe how we manage office resources and connect with people, followed by a user study that we conducted in our office.},

 abstract = {Sensor-enabled smartphones are opening a new frontier in the development of mobile sensing applications. The recognition of human activities and context from sensor-data using classification models underpins these emerging applications. However, conventional approaches to training classifiers struggle to cope with the diverse user populations routinely found in large-scale popular mobile applications. Differences between users (e.g., age, sex, behavioral patterns, lifestyle) confuse classifiers, which assume everyone is the same. To address this, we propose Community Similarity Networks (CSN), which incorporates inter-person similarity measurements into the classifier training process. Under CSN every user has a unique classifier that is tuned to their own characteristics. CSN exploits crowd-sourced sensor-data to personalize classifiers with data contributed from other similar users. This process is guided by similarity networks that measure different dimensions of inter-person similarity. Our experiments show CSN outperforms existing approaches to classifier training under the presence of population diversity.},

 abstract = {As ubiquitous computing becomes increasingly mobile and social, personal information sharing will likely increase in frequency, the variety of friends to share with, and range of information that can be shared. Past work has identified that whom you share with is important for choosing whether or not to share, but little work has explored which features of interpersonal relationships influence sharing. We present the results of a study of 42 participants, who self-report aspects of their relationships with 70 of their friends, including frequency of collocation and communication, closeness, and social group. Participants rated their willingness to share in 21 different scenarios based on information a UbiComp system could provide. Our findings show that (a) self-reported closeness is the strongest indicator of willingness to share, (b) individuals are more likely to share in scenarios with common information (e.g. we are within one mile of each other) than other kinds of scenarios (e.g. my location wherever I am), and (c) frequency of communication predicts both closeness and willingness to share better than frequency of collocation.},

 abstract = {A key challenge of data-driven social science is the gathering of high quality multi-dimensional datasets. A second challenge relates to design and execution of structured experimental interventions in-situ, in a way comparable to the reliability and intentionality of ex-situ laboratory experiments. In this paper we introduce the Friends and Family study, in which a young-family residential community is transformed into a living laboratory. We employ a ubiquitous computing approach that combines extremely rich data collection in terms of signals, dimensionality, and throughput, together with the ability to conduct targeted experimental interventions with study populations. We present our mobile-phone-based social and behavioral sensing system, which has been deployed for over a year now. Finally, we describe a novel tailored intervention aimed at increasing physical activity in the subject population. Results demonstrate the value of social factors for motivation and adherence, and allow us to quantify the contribution of different incentive mechanisms.},
