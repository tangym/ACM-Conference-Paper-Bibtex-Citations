At times when emotions are running high, some people may benefit from the help of their friends. If people are aware of emotional states of their friends, they can start a conversation to understand why they feel like that and how to support them. I study on a new interaction method for the awareness of emotions and to manage the emotional states. This paper presents one part of my study that aims to help mobile users to interact offline with their friends when they need emotional support. Emotions of mobile users will be detected with the new emotion detection method in development.},

In addition to the risk of being stolen, mobile devices are increasingly susceptible to different types of software attacks.

One of these is geographical range query. This research realizes it using Z-order in the same way with related works [1][2][3][4]. The other requirement is distributed sensor data management. Current systems adapt the way that stores the data in a (or some) centralized server(s), or that stores the data in many servers, having one centralized server to store indexes of the address of the data. This research proposes a method not relating real space geographical information and relative position of peer in ID space. By using this method, in the place where density of people and smart phones with many sensors increase suddenly such as Super Bowl and new year countdown in NY, by using DHT, sensor data don't concentrate on a specified peer on managing the data.

Despite the great potential in physiological stress recognition, there are some critical issues that need to be addressed such as the sensitivity and variability of physiology to many factors other than stress (e.g., physical activity). To resolve these issues, in this paper, we focus on the understanding of physiological responses to both stressor and physical activity and perform stress recognition, particularly in situations having multiple stimuli: physical activity and stressors. We construct stress models that correspond to individual situations, and we validate our stress modeling in the presence of physical activity. Analysis of our experiments provides an understanding on how physiological responses change with different stressors and how physical activity confounds stress recognition with physiological responses. In both objective and subjective settings, the accuracy of stress recognition drops by more than 14% when physical activity is performed. However, by modularizing stress models with respect to physical activity, we can recognize stress with accuracies of 82% (objective stress) and 87% (subjective stress), achieving more than a 5-10% improvement from approaches that do not take physical activity into account.},

The gestures were detected from the eye-tracking data by a range-based algorithm, which was found accurate enough in recognizing nodding and left-directed gestures. The gaze estimation accuracy did not noticeably suffer from the quick head motions. Participants pointed to nodding as the best gesture for occasional selections tasks and rated the other gestures as promising methods for navigation (turning) and functional mode switching (tilting). In general, dwell time works well for repeated tasks such as eye typing.

To validate our design, we deployed FigureEnergy "in the wild" -- 12 participants installed meters in their homes and used the system for a period of two weeks. The results suggest that the annotation approach is successful overall: by engaging with the data users started to relate energy consumption to activities rather than just to appliances. Moreover, they were able to discover that some appliances consume more than they expected, despite having had prior experience of using other electricity displays.},

 abstract = {Understanding and facilitating real-life social interaction is a high-impact goal for Ubicomp research. Microphone arrays offer the unique capability to provide continuous, calm capture of verbal interaction in large physical spaces, such as homes and (especially open-plan) offices. Most microphone array work has focused on arrays of custom sensors in small spaces, and a few recent works have tested small arrays of commodity sensors in single rooms. This paper describes the first working scalable and cost-effective array that offers high-precision localization of conversational speech, and hence enables ongoing studies of verbal interactions in large semi-structured spaces. This work represents significant improvements over prior work in three dimensions -- cost, scale and accuracy. It also achieves high throughput for real-time updates of tens of active sources using off-the-shelf components. We describe the system design, key localization algorithms, and a systematic performance evaluation. We then show how source location data can be usefully aggregated to reveal interesting patterns in group conversations, such as dominance and engagement.},

 abstract = {The adjunct program has always been a very important part of the UbiComp and Pervasive conference series, and this year is no exception. The conference is preceded by no less than two full days of workshops, featuring 18 one-day workshops, one two-day workshop, and a two-day Doctoral School. Posters, demos, and videos are scheduled at key moments within the main conference schedule: demos form the highlight of the Welcome Reception on the first day, posters are shown in two 2-hour "munch-and-mingle" lunch sessions, and videos are woven into the regular session program. Long-time attendees of the respective conference series have come to appreciate the many opportunities that the adjunct program offers for creating interactions among community members. This year we received a total number of 202 submissions to the adjunct program: 30 workshop proposals, 27 video submissions, 47 demo submissions, and 98 poster submissions. The 2013 workshop program is the largest of any previous UbiComp or Pervasive conference. Out of the 21 workshops that were selected, 18 eventually decided to include their papers in this volume and in the ACM Digital Library. The video, demo, and poster program is equally impressive. As in previous years, it was possible to submit one piece of work simultaneously as a video, demo, and poster, giving authors the opportunity to present their work in different presentation formats and ultimately receiving significantly more face-time with conference attendees. Approximately 20% of the video, demo, and poster submissions took advantage of this opportunity, with the combination "poster and demo" being the most popular combination (13 submissions). All submissions were peer-reviewed by at least one reviewer, with two or more reviews being assigned when necessary. We were able to accept 105 submissions (27 demos, 11 videos, and 67 posters), which results in an acceptance rate of 63% for the adjunct track. All associated extended abstracts (4 pages in the SICGHI landscape format) are available through the ACM digital library as part of the Adjunct Proceedings of UbiComp 2013. As in the past, authors of accepted papers for the main program were able to present their work also in the adjunct track, without submitting a separate extended abstract. Authors of 23 of the 92 accepted full papers and notes took advantage of this option and presented their work also a poster, demo, or video (or a combination of these) at the conference. Our thanks go to all authors who submitted their work to the UbiComp 2013 adjunct track -- your active participation in this conference series is a key ingredient to its vibrancy and scientific mrelevance. We sincerely hope that you will enjoy the adjunct program as much as we did when organizing it!},

LiDSN leverages light-based communication between an LED and a light sensor in order to add a new sensor node securely into existing WSN. Through touching interaction, a new sensor node ID and secret key can be transmitted to the WSN, and then the WSN is able to identify which node should be added while maintaining the security of the WSN.},

Tasks such as the prediction of human movement can be addressed through the usage of these data, in turn offering support for more advanced applications, such as adaptive mobile services with proactive context-based functions. This paper presents an hybrid method for predicting human mobility on the basis of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The proposed approach clusters location histories according to their characteristics, and latter trains an HMM for each cluster. The usage of HMMs allows us to account with location characteristics as unobservable parameters, and also to account with the effects of each individual's previous actions. We report on a series of experiments with a real-world location history dataset from the GeoLife project, showing that a prediction accuracy of 13.85% can be achieved when considering regions of roughly 1280 squared meters.},

Therefore, a dataset containing thermal imaging has been recorded during a No Limit Texas Hold'Em Poker tournament-session with six players in total and two players being observed with a high-resolution thermal imaging camera and manual provision of their dealt private cards as ground-truth. Preliminary results show that the facial skin temperature varies massively (±1.2°C), which constitutes the research hypothesis that a significant change in the surface face skin temperature can be linked to the quality of the dealt cards in terms of winning chance for an actually played hand.},

 abstract = {Effective WiFi power management can strongly impact the energy consumption on Smartphones. Through controlled experiments, we find that WiFi power management on a wide variety of Smartphones is a largely autonomous process that is processed completely at the driver level. Driver level implementations suffer from the limitation that important power management decisions can be made only by observing packets at the MAC layer. This approach has the unfortunate side effect that each application has equal opportunity to impact WiFi power management to consume more energy, since distinguishing between applications is not feasible at the MAC layer. The power cost difference between WiFi power modes is high (a factor of 20 times when idle), therefore determining which applications are permitted to impact WiFi power management is an important and relevant problem. In this paper we propose SAPSM: Smart Adaptive Power Save Mode. SAPSM labels each application with a priority with the assistance of a machine learning classifier. Only high priority applications affect the client's behavior to switch to CAM or Active mode, while low priority traffic is optimized for energy efficiency. Our implementation on an Android Smartphone improves energy savings by up to 56% under typical usage patterns.},

This paper addresses the joint identification of the indoor movement of multiple persons forming a cohesive whole - specifically a flock - with clustering approaches operating on features derived from multiple sensor modalities of modern smartphones. Automatic detection of flocks has several important applications, including evacuation management and socially aware computing. The novelty of this paper is, firstly, to use data fusion techniques to combine several sensor modalities (WiFi, accelerometer and compass) to improve recognition accuracy over previous unimodal approaches. Secondly, improve the recognition of flocks using hierarchical clustering. We use a dataset comprising 16 subjects forming one to four flocks walking in a building on single and multiple floors.

The aggregated data was displayed in real time in various intuitive and interactive formats on a public website. We found privacy to be one of the main design constraints, and transparency to be the best strategy to gain participants' acceptance. In a survey (with 300 responses), participants reported that the system made them smile more than they expected, and it made them and others around them feel momentarily better. Quantitative analysis of the interactions revealed periodic patterns (e.g., more smiles during the weekends) and strong correlation with campus events (e.g., fewer smiles during exams, most smiles the day after graduation), reflecting the emotional responses of a large community.},

The context is of consumer experience and choice of an artifact where the generation of subliminal perception through an intelligent 3D interface controls the spatio-temporal aspects of the information displayed and of the emergent narrative.

These specialists rely on direct observation of the behavior, usually in a controlled clinical environment. In this paper, we present a technique for using on-body accelerometers to assist in automated classification of problem behavior during such direct observation. Using simulated data of episodes of severe behavior acted out by trained specialists, we demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to segment relevant behavioral episodes from a continuous sensor stream and to classify them into distinct categories of severe behavior (aggression, disruption, and self-injury). We further validate our approach by demonstrating it produces no false positives when applied to a publicly accessible dataset of activities of daily living. Finally, we show promising classification results when our sensing and analysis system is applied to data from a real assessment session conducted with a child exhibiting problem behaviors.},

 abstract = {The primacy hypothesis about affection (Zajonc, 1980) holds that positive and negative affective reactions can be elicited with minimal stimulus input and virtually no cognitive processing. This hypothesis challenges the cognitive appraisal viewpoint (Lazarus, 1982), which maintains that affection cannot emerge without prior cognitive mediation. There have been many studies shown that human emotion could be affected by subliminal visual stimulus, so how about subliminal auditory stimulus (SAS)? In this study two pieces of traditional Chinese music were used as SAS, and the unheard music was played in a continuous loop, which was different from the commonly used priming paradigm. 56 undergraduates were randomly divided into two groups, participants in one group were exposed to the subliminal happy music, and in the other group were exposed to the subliminal sad music. A before-and-after self-paired design was used to assess the emotion of all the subjects. During the experiment their galvanic skin response (GSR) and subjective ratings were recorded. The results showed that SAS caused the obviously change on human's GSR, but there was no change found in their subjective ratings of emotional valence (happy-unhappy). A lot of evidence showed that GSR was more sensitive than subjective ratings for the evaluation to current emotion status. The overall results of our study confirmed this perspective. So, we believed that SAS affected people's emotion, and this kind of affective priming wasn't perceived consciously by people themselves.},

If users keep such unhealthy postures for a long time, they are susceptible to musculoskeletal disorders and eye problems such as cervical disc and myopia, respectively. To prevent users from having these diseases, we propose a new methodology to monitor the posture of smartphone users with built-in sensors. The proposed mechanism estimates various values representing user postures like the tilt angle of the neck, viewing distance, and gaze condition of the user, by analyzing sensor data from a front-faced camera, 3-axis accelerometer, orientation sensor, or any combination thereof, and warns the user if estimated values are maintained within the abnormal range over the allowed time. Via the proposed mechanism, users are able to be aware of their unhealthy postures, and then try to correct their postures.},

Many media façades cover most of the outer shell of a building and come with a 3D form factor. They offer great potential for remote interaction in which the interactive area goes beyond the parts of the façade that are visible from the user's current perspective. Common interaction techniques often focus on a fixed part of the media façade. This restricts exploiting the full capabilities and the potential of such gigantic screens. In this paper we describe how to apply cartographic map projections to create 2D map representations of media façades to address this problem. We describe how a continuous interaction with the media façade is possible, independent of the form factor. We analyze existing media façades and provide a set of guidelines for how to create façade maps for different form factors.},

 abstract = {On behalf of the organizing committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing. This is the third time the UbiComp conference series has come to Asia. This year's conference in Beijing, China, follows Seoul, Korea (2008) and Tokyo, Japan (2005). UbiComp is a conference that truly captures the wide variety of research activities in the diverse field of ubiquitous computing, encompassing research from, e.g., Human-Computer Interaction, Mobile Computing, Location and Sensing Technology, Machine Learning, Middleware and Systems, and Programming Models and Tools. September 2011 also marks a historic date in the history of Ubicomp. It is exactly 20 years from when Dr. Mark Weiser's historic article, "The Computer for the Twenty-First Century," appeared in Scientific American. This article is acclaimed for widely publicizing the idea of Ubicomp in the research community and setting the goals for the early years of the field. We will mark this historic occasion with a special panel in tribute to the late Dr. Weiser. Our panel of luminaries, including those who worked with Dr. Weiser at Xerox PARC, as well as his contemporaries who were influenced by his work at the time, will reminisce on Mark's predictions as well as present their view of where the field should move going forward. Each UbiComp conference represents a snapshot of our field, capturing the state-of-the-art in technology, the research challenges we are addressing, as well as the people that form the UbiComp community. Each year's proceedings represent an opportunity to learn about new areas and identify upcoming research opportunities, and this year is no exception. UbiComp 2011 continues the tradition of a single-track program that allows participants to experience the entire program in a variety of sessions, ranging from context awareness to location sharing, from home infrastructures to novel interactions, and from persuasive computing to sensing. This year our international Program Committee, composed of 28 of the leading researchers in the field, evaluated a record number of 302 submissions --- 234 full papers and 68 notes. Using a multi-phase review process, initially each submission was reviewed by at least one member of the PC and three or more external reviewers. Of the 302 submissions, 118 were evaluated by 1-2 additional PC members and discussed at a 2- day PC meeting held on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. In total, the Program Committee and 531 external reviewers spent countless hours to provide feedback to the authors through 1343 reviews. After this rigorous process, a total of 50 submissions --- 44 full papers and 6 notes --- were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 16.6%. We feel our selective review process has resulted in a high-quality set of published papers. A sub-committee discussed and selected five of the 50 accepted papers to be recognized in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. Of these five, one stood out as the best paper of UbiComp 2011. This year also sees a high quality adjunct program, accepting 23 demos, 7 videos, and 34 posters, for a total of 56 accepted adjunct papers out of 85 submissions (note that several accepted adjunct submissions appear in multiple categories, but are only counted once in the acceptance numbers). Continued from UbiComp 2010, we encouraged authors of accepted full papers and notes to also submit a poster, video, or demo of their work, to better engage the audience and stimulate discussion. To properly reflect the significance of the work represented in the adjunct program, these submissions also see a tighter integration in the main program, with video presentations interspersed with the technical presentations of the main track, and posters and demos presented during lunch breaks. The workshop program has 13 workshops that cover both traditional Ubicomp topics (e.g., context awareness, location-based services, mobile sensing, health, and design) and newer topics (e.g., crowdsourcing and urban computing). This year, we launched the first tutorial program in UbiComp conference history. We offered five tutorials by leading experts on the topics of activity recognition, Android development, evaluation, ubicomp research in the wild, and urban sensing. We also experimented with a new Visions of Ubicomp Film Contest. Last but not least, Jan Chipchase's keynote will offer a provocative look at the future of ubiquitous computing in new settings. We hope you find this year's program interesting, useful and enjoyable. Several organizations and people contributed to the success of UbiComp 2011 and we are grateful for their support. First, we would like to thank Tsinghua University for hosting and helping to organize UbiComp. We also appreciate the sponsorship of ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGMOBILE and ACM SIGSPATIAL. Finally, the conference could not occur without the kind financial support of our benefactors Microsoft Research, Shanda, NSFC, NSF, Qualcomm, Google, IGRS, HTC, Nokia, Intel, AutoDesk, Opzoon, and Telezoon.},

This year our international Program Committee, composed of 45 of the leading researchers in the field of ubiquitous computing, evaluated 301 submissions - 223 full papers and 78 notes. Using a multi-phase review process, after quick-rejecting a small number of incomplete or off-topic submissions, each submission was initially reviewed by at least two members of the program committee and two or more external reviewers. Of the 301 submissions, 67 were evaluated by 1-3 additional PC members. After an online discussion, 11 submissions were auto-accepted and 93 submissions were chosen for further review and discussion at a 2-day PC meeting. In total, the Program Committee and 415 external reviewers spent countless hours to provide feedback to the authors through 1245 reviews. After this rigorous process, a record total of 58 submissions - 50 full papers and 8 notes - were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 19.3%. We are pleased to note this acceptance rate equals the highest in the fourteen-year history of the UbiComp conference thus far. We feel our selective review process has resulted in a high-quality set of published papers. A sub-committee discussed and selected 12 of the 58 accepted papers (equivalent to 4% of the submitted papers) to be recognized in these proceedings for their particular level of quality.

Although the advantage of the Internet is live communication between a performer and listeners, the current mode of communication is writing comments using Twitter or Facebook, or some similar messaging network. In one type of live broadcast, musical performances, it is difficult for a musician, when playing an instrument, to communicate with listeners by writing comments. We propose a new communication mode between performers who play musical instruments, and their listeners by enabling listeners to control the performer's camera or illumination remotely. The results of four weeks of experiment confirm the emergence of nonverbal communication between a performer and listeners, and among listeners, which increases camaraderie amongst listeners and performers. Additionally, the dramatic impact of a performance is increased by enabling listeners to control various camera actions such as zoom-in or pan in real time. The results also provide implications for design of future interactive live broadcasting services.},

Current context-aware systems mainly model limited user situations, which constrains their coverage and effect in real world usage. This paper proposes an encyclopedic knowledge network to enable practical context inference in our daily life by: 1) expressing essential semantics of contextual concepts and relations into a well-informed relational network, and 2) exploiting relational semantics to infer various contexts simultaneously. The performance of the approach is validated in real challenging problems and compared with inference of human being.},

In pursuit of this goal, this paper proposes a context model, Rover Context Model (RoCoM), structured around four primitives that can be used to represent and model any situation and activity: entities, events, relationships, and activities. It introduces the notion of templates of context for each primitive and describes, albeit briefly, the RoCoM Ontology (RoCoMO). It also describes the design and architecture of an abstract, generic and intelligent context-aware middleware called Rover II. We propose this framework as a solution to address the context problem as a whole, and be usable in many domains. We also illustrate its application with the aid of a context-aware public safety application that is deployed in the UMD campus.},

The F-measure of the Support Vector Machine classification of 12 activities using only our BodyScope sensor was 79.5%. We also conducted a small-scale in-the-wild study, and found that BodyScope was able to identify four activities (eating, drinking, speaking, and laughing) at 71.5% accuracy.},

We show how vehicle travel times and road congestion can be inferred from anonymized signaling data collected from a cellular mobile network. While other previous studies have considered data only from active devices, e.g., engaged in voice calls, our approach exploits also data from idle users resulting in an enormous gain in coverage and estimation accuracy.

We explored a variety of contextual information, such as last used App, time, location, and the user profile, to predict the user's App usage using the MDC dataset. We present three findings from our studies. First, the contextual information can be used to learn the pattern of user's App usage and to predict App usage effectively. Second, for the MDC dataset, the correlation between sequentially used Apps has a strong contribution to the prediction accuracy. Lastly, the linear model is more effective than the Bayesian model to combine all contextual information and for such predictions.},

However, it is unclear how laypersons perceive the increasingly active artifacts. These perceptions are likely to foreground their future responses to IoT objects as they become relevant actors in the physical world and begin to influence everyday user experience. We conducted an in-depth interview study to investigate individuals' knowledge, attitudes, expectations and concerns relating to IoT technologies. Findings show that affordances such as interactivity and modality can be reconceptualized in order to enhance user perceptions of relatedness with the objects. Different from technology-centric and user-centric approaches, the paper suggests a balance between human agency and object agency by adopting a need-oriented design paradigm when building an integral, self-adjusting, user-relevant archetype of IoT.},

Considerable custom engineering is required to ensure hardware and software prototypes work robustly, and recruiting and managing more than a handful of households can be difficult and cost-prohibitive. To lower the barrier to developing and evaluating new technologies for the home environment, we call for the development of a shared infrastructure, called HomeLab. HomeLab consists of a large number of geographically distributed households, each running a common, flexible framework (e.g., HomeOS [4]) in which experiments are implemented. The use of a common framework enables engineering effort, along with experience and expertise, to be shared among many research groups. Recruitment of households to HomeLab can be organic: as a research group recruits (a few) households to participate in its field study, these households can be invited to join HomeLab and participate in future studies conducted by other groups. As the pool of households participating in HomeLab grows, we hope that researchers will find it easier to recruit a large number of households to participate in field studies.},

 abstract = {Most of the systems for recognition of activities aim to identify a set of normal human activities. Data is either recorded by computer vision or sensor based networks. These systems may not work properly if an unusual event or abnormal activity occurs, especially ones that have not been encountered in the past. By definition, unusual events are mostly rare and unexpected, and therefore very little or no data may be available for training. In this paper, we focus on the challenging problem of detecting unusual temporal events in a sensor network and present three Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based approaches to tackle this problem. The first approach models each normal activity separately as an HMM and the second approach models all the normal activities together as one common HMM. If the likelihood is lower than a threshold, an unusual event is identified. The third approach models all normal activities together in one HMM and approximates an HMM for the the unusual events. All the methods train HMM models on data of the usual events and do not require training data from the unusual events. We perform our experiments on a Locomotion Analysis dataset that contains gyroscope, force sensor, and accelerometer readings. To test the performance of our approaches, we generate five types of unusual events that represent random activity, extremely unusual events, unusual events similar to specific normal activities, no or little motion and normal activity followed by no or little motion. Our experiments suggest that for a moderately sized time frame window, these approaches can identify all the five types of unusual events with high confidence.},

Different applications aim to aid tourists and provide better experience in their travels by matching co-located users based on what they have in common. However, users with little in common but with potential to help each other given the context and place could not be matched. In this paper we introduce traMSNet, a LBSN that implements a matching algorithm considering homophily, as well as users complementary skills in a touristic location. Our idea is validated with a survey that asked potential travelers about their needs when looking for a travel partner. Moreover, we present a matching algorithm that is evaluated it with real tourists. The evaluation shows that considering complementarity when matching individuals is preferred by users. Therefore, by only considering similarities, important issues are left aside.},

 abstract = {Smartphone security research has produced many useful tools to analyze the privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps. However, these automated tools cannot assess people's perceptions of whether a given action is legitimate, or how that action makes them feel with respect to privacy. For example, automated tools might detect that a blackjack game and a map app both use one's location information, but people would likely view the map's use of that data as more legitimate than the game. Our work introduces a new model for privacy, namely privacy as expectations. We report on the results of using crowdsourcing to capture users' expectations of what sensitive resources mobile apps use. We also report on a new privacy summary interface that prioritizes and highlights places where mobile apps break people's expectations. We conclude with a discussion of implications for employing crowdsourcing as a privacy evaluation technique.},

We use an ensemble method, in which we extract different mobility patterns with multiple models and then combine these models under a probabilistic framework. The key idea lies in the assumption that human mobility can be explained by several mobility patterns that depend on a sub-set of the contextual variables and these can be learned by a simple model. We showed how this idea can be applied to two specific online prediction tasks: what is the next place a user will visit? and how long will he stay in the current place?. Using smartphone data collected from 153 users during 17 months, we show the potential of our method in predicting human mobility in real life.},

 abstract = {The proliferation of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) has been rapid during the last year due to the number of novel services they can support. The main interaction between users in an LBSN is location sharing, which builds the spatial component of the system. The majority of the LBSNs make use of the notion of check-in, to enable users to volunteeringly share their whereabouts with their peers and the system. The flow of this spatial information is unidirectional and originates from the users' side. Given that currently there is no infrastructure in place for detecting fake checkins, the quality of the spatial information plane of an LBSN is solely based on the honesty of the users. In this paper, we seek to raise the awareness of the community for this problem, by identifying and discussing the effects of the presence of fake location information. We further present a preliminary design of a fake check-in detection scheme, based on location-proofs. Our initial simulation results show that if we do not consider the infrastructural constraints, location-proofs can form a viable technical solution.},

Our findings show that improved interfaces through web and mobile applications changed the interactions between users and their home system. Intelligibility and accuracy of the machine learning and sensing technology influenced the way participants perceive and adapt to the system. The convenient control over the system combined with limitations of the technology may have prevented the desired energy savings.

The number of users regularly accessing services from their phones is rising and, therefore, local information is becoming more and more important, for example in targeted marketing and personalized services. In particular, news, from gossips to security alerts, are daily spread across cities through social networks. Content produced by users is consumed by their friends or followers, whose locations can be known or inferred. The spatial location of users' social connections strongly affects the areas where such information will be disseminated. As a consequence, some users can deliver content to a certain geographic area more easily and efficiently than others, for example because they have a larger number of friends in that area. In this paper we present a set of metrics that quantitatively capture the effects of social links on the spreading of information in a given area. We discuss possible application scenarios and we present an initial critical evaluation by means of two datasets from Twitter and Foursquare by discussing a series of case studies.},

 abstract = {We present a first study of using RGB-D (Kinect-style) cameras for fine-grained recognition of kitchen activities. Our prototype system combines depth (shape) and color (appearance) to solve a number of perception problems crucial for smart space applications: locating hands, identifying objects and their functionalities, recognizing actions and tracking object state changes through actions. Our proof-of-concept results demonstrate great potentials of RGB-D perception: without need for instrumentation, our system can robustly track and accurately recognize detailed steps through cooking activities, for instance how many spoons of sugar are in a cake mix, or how long it has been mixing. A robust RGB-D based solution to fine-grained activity recognition in real-world conditions will bring the intelligence of pervasive and interactive systems to the next level.},

 abstract = {Researches on recommending followees in social networks have attracted a lot of attentions in recent years. Existing studies on this topic mostly treat this kind of recommendation as just a type of friend recommendation. However, apart from making friends, the reason of a user to follow someone in social networks is inherently to satisfy his/her information needs in asymmetrical manner. In this paper, we propose a novel mining-based recommendation approach named Geographic-Textual-Social Based Followee Recommendation (GTS-FR), which takes into account the user movements, online texting and social properties to discover the relationship between users' information needs and provided information for followee recommendation. The core idea of our proposal is to discover users' similarity in terms of all the three properties of information which are provided by the users in a Location-Based Social Network (LBSN). To achieve this goal, we define three kinds of features to capture the key properties of users' interestingness from their provided information. In GTS-FR approach, we propose a series of novel similarity measurements to calculate similarity of each pair of users based on various properties. Based on the similarity, we make on-line recommendation for the followee a user might be interested in following. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on followee recommendation in LBSNs by exploring the geographic, textual and social properties simultaneously. Through a comprehensive evaluation using a real LBSN dataset, we show that the proposed GTS-FR approach delivers excellent performance and outperforms existing stat-of-the-art friend recommendation methods significantly.},

The challenge of bright uncontrolled daylight illumination complicates the process of locating the subject's pupil. To make mobile eye tracking more ubiquitous, we are developing more sophisticated algorithms to find the subject's pupil. We use a semi-supervised process to initiate the pupil tracking, automatically generate an ensemble of models of the pupil for each video, and use multi-frame techniques to help locate the pupil across frames. A mixture of experts (consensus) is used to indicate a good estimate of pupil location. The algorithm presented here details developing work in automatically finding the pupil in situations where there is a significant amount of light reflecting off the eye, when the subject is squinting, and when the pupil is partially occluded. The output of this algorithm will be cascaded into a subsequent stage for exact pupil fitting.},

 abstract = {In todays product management life-cycle data play a growing role. Fixed product data, sensor readings and external events form continuously growing data collections, the digital object memory. To create a surplus value, this data is exploited in applications, e.g. by asking queries to such memories (e.g. "get unexpected observations"). The necessary logic to answer such questions may vary with time as different entities come in contact with different types of objects. This raises the challenge how to decouple questions from the corresponding logic, how to modify the logic, how to deploy such logic to the memory and how to execute the logic on the memory itself. This article describes work in progress concerning extending an existing memory framework to support analysis, processing and communication behavior of so called Active Digital Object Memories.},

Recently, many related works address to detect real world events from social media such as Twitter. However, geotagged tweets often contain noise, which means tweets which are not content-wise related to users' location. This noise is problem for detecting real world events. To address and solve the problem, we define the Place-Triggered Geotagged Tweet, meaning tweets which have both geotag and content-based relation to users' location. We designed and implemented a keyword-based matching technique to detect and classify place-triggered geotagged tweets. We evaluated the performance of our method against a ground truth provided by 18 human classifiers, and achieved 82% accuracy. Additionally, we also present two example applications for visualizing place-triggered geotagged tweets.},

 abstract = {Is subliminal priming able to affect people's choices and decision-making? The prisoners' dilemma is a canonical example of a game analyzed that shows why two individuals might not cooperate each other, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so. In the regular version of the prisoner's dilemma game, collaboration is dominated by betrayal, and as a result, the only possible outcome of the game is for both prisoners to betray the other. Regardless of what the other prisoner chooses one will always gain a greater payoff by betraying the other. Because betrayal is always more beneficial than cooperation, all objective prisoners would seemingly betray the other. This study examined whether subliminal emotional faces influence human's decision-making in the repeated prisoners' dilemma. In this study, subliminal emotional face was the independent variable. According to different emotional valence (happy, neutral or angry) and different present way of emotional faces (a transparent figure, or a backward masking face), the independent variable has 7 levels. So, 84 undergraduates were randomly divided into seven groups, participants in each group were subliminally primed with one kind of unseen face, after which they completed pre-designed negotiations task. The results showed that whatever the way to show subliminal emotional faces: by a transparent figure, or backward masking, both affected human's decision-making. Under the influence of different ways to present subliminal faces, participants choose their own behavior more cooperative or more uncooperative. These findings contribute to subliminal perception research on decision-making and the implications for this study are discussed.},

To alleviate the cognitive load associated with the interaction with the variety of emerging information and assistance systems in the car, subliminal stimulation is assumed to be a promising technique. To assess the potential of subliminal cues that could be used as their interaction means in future vehicles, we have organized a workshop within the frame of the automotive user interfaces conference (AutoUI 2011) to discuss this topic in a group of experts. This paper summarizes the findings from that workshop and should give researchers a starting point for their own activities in the field by indicating sort of grand research challenges and most critical issues. In particular, the goal of this summary article is to make this challenging research field more 'tangible' for researchers working in a range of disciplines, such as engineering, neuroscience, computer science, and psychophysiology. While currently discussed in the automotive domain only, the principles, research questions, and findings could immediately (and easily) be transferred to and adopted in other research fields. Interaction based on subliminal techniques can have an impact on society at large, making significant contributions toward a more natural, convenient, and even relaxing future style of interaction with any complex systems.},

Foursquare, one of the most popular LBSNs, gives incentives to users who visit (check in) specific places (venues) by means of, for instance, mayorships to frequent visitors. Moreover, users may leave tips at specific venues as well as mark previous tips as done in sign of agreement. Unlike check ins, which are shared only with friends, the lists of mayorships, tips and dones of a user are publicly available to everyone, thus raising concerns about disclosure of the user's movement patterns and interests. We analyze how users explore these publicly available features, and their potential as sources of information leakage. Specifically, we characterize the use of mayorships, tips and dones in Foursquare based on a dataset with around 13 million users. We also analyze whether it is possible to easily infer the home city (state and country) of a user from these publicly available information. Our results indicate that one can easily infer the home city of around 78% of the analyzed users within 50 kilometers.},

This paper considers how such technologies might be harnessed to support language learning, and specifically Task-Based Learning (TBL). Task-Based Learning (TBL) involves doing meaningful tasks in a foreign language, emphasising the language's use in practice. TBL is seen as a highly engaging and motivating approach to learning a language, but is difficult to do in the classroom. Here, learners typically engage in activities that only simulate 'real-world' tasks, and as such only rehearse language use, rather than applying the language in practice. In this paper, we explore how an instrumented, context-aware environment whose design is grounded in pedagogical principles can support TBL. We present the French Kitchen, an instrumented kitchen for English speakers who are learning French, and describe a 46-participant evaluation of the kitchen. Based on the evaluation, we provide a set of design recommendations for those building instrumented systems for TBL.},

These relations are useful for users in both location and friend recommendations. In this paper, we focus on exploring the local geographic topics through check-ins in Pittsburgh area in Foursquare.

It aims to automatically uncover and quantify characteristic behavior patterns in users' daily lives as well as disclose behavior clustering structure among multiple users. The key challenge is how to define a naturally interpreted representation for users' daily behavior patterns, which can be easily exploited to not only uncover the behavior similarity among multiple users but also predict users' future activities. In this paper, we define such a representation, and propose a probabilistic framework which can automatically learn it from mass amount of mobile data in unsupervised setting and exploit it to predict user activities. By an appropriate information sharing among multiple users, this framework overcomes single-user data sparsity problem and effectively identifies behavior clustering structures in a set of users.

In particular, the unprecedented sensitivity of contextual data, and the potential harms associated with inferences made on the basis of that data, highlights the need to revisit our design principles in respect of consent.

A number of previous studies have compared the performance of various classifiers for TM detection. However, the current study is the first work aiming to understand how TM detection performance is impacted by how the recorded location traces are segmented into data segments for training a classifier. In our preliminary experiments we examine three trace segmentation (TS) methods---Uniform Duration (UniDur), Uniform Number of Location Points (UniNP), and Uniform Distance (UniDis)---and compare their performance on detecting different transportation modes. The results indicate that while driving can be more accurately detected by using UniDis method, walking and bus can be more accurately detected by using UniDur method. This suggests that choosing a right TS method for training a TM classifier is an important step to accurately detect particular transportation modes.},

We consider general principles of opportunistic routing and present the results of several studies with a corpus of real-world trips.

Room localization, which identifies the room a person or mobile phone is in, provides a powerful tool for characterizing human indoor activities and helping address challenges in public health, productivity, building management, etc. Existing room localization methods, however, require labor-intensive manual annotation of individual rooms. We present ARIEL, a room localization system that automatically learns room fingerprints based on occupants' indoor movements. ARIEL consists of (1) a zone-based clustering algorithm that accurately identifies in-room occupancy "hotspot(s)" using Wi-Fi signatures; (2) a motion-based clustering algorithm to identify inter-zone correlation, thereby distinguishing different rooms; and (3) an energy-efficient motion detection algorithm to minimize the noise of Wi-Fi signatures. ARIEL has been implemented and deployed for real-world testing with 21 users over a 10-month period. Our studies show that it supports room localization with higher than 95% accuracy without requiring labor-intensive manual annotation.},

It can also control the amount of sunlight and create shadows, called programmable shadows, in order to afford indoor comfort without completely blocking the outer view.

We propose to (re-)explore this notion of the locality of networks in the age of the ubiquitous Wifi hotspot in cafes, bars, community centers, and other (semi-)public places in order to facilitate co-located activities for such varied purposes as fostering local community, civic participation, sociality in general, and entertainment. We propose a network locality that builds on local infrastructure (WLAN) and combines personal devices (mobile phones) with stationary interactive surface technology (wall displays and tables) to facilitate social on-and off-line interactions in local settings.

The field test, which took place with 50 corporate car drivers, demonstrates an improvement in the overall fuel efficiency by 3.23%.

 abstract = {Home and automation are not natural partners--one homey and the other cold. Most current automation in the home is packaged in the form of appliances. To better understand the current reality and possible future of living with other types of domestic technology, we went out into the field to conduct need finding interviews among people who have already introduced automation into their homes and kept it there--home automators. We present the lessons learned from these home automators as frameworks and implications for the values that domestic technology should support. In particular, we focus on the satisfaction and meaning that the home automators derived from their projects, especially in connecting to their homes (rather than simply controlling their homes). These results point the way toward other technologies designed for our everyday lives at home.},

Following their lead, we propose to use a form of public participation in scientific research known as participatory sensing to increase engagement in these academic areas. Participatory sensing involves volunteers using mobile phones and the embedded sensing capabilities to collect data, and is well suited for the task as it provides the students with a familiar tool for conducting complex scientific research. To accomplish this goal, we have developed two components: a toolkit for defining, creating, and managing a participatory sensing campaign, including automated generation of mobile applications; and a curriculum designed around the toolkit, where students conduct scientific research with mobile phones as their primary data collection tools. Thus far, the results of this work have shown the potential for participatory sensing as an informal education tool to increase engagement and interest in pursuing careers in science and technology.},

These devices typically contain many sensors, such as vision sensors (cameras), audio sensors (microphones), acceleration sensors (accelerometers) and location sensors (e.g., GPS), and also have some capability to send and receive data wirelessly. Sensor arrays on these mobile devices make innovative applications possible, especially when data mining is applied to the sensor data. But a key design decision is how best to distribute the responsibilities between the client (e.g., smartphone) and any servers. In this paper we investigate alternative architectures, ranging from a "dumb" client, where virtually all processing takes place on the server, to a "smart" client, where no server is needed. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative architectures and describe under what circumstances each is most appropriate. We use our own WISDM (WIreless Sensor Data Mining) architecture to provide concrete examples of the various alternatives.},

While the context-aware self-adaptive system models are under intensive research in individual computing domains, their integration into a collective adaptive system still remains a major challenge. This position paper visions a meet-in-the-middle approach, where horizontal integration is applied to sub-system models extracted from vertical integration. The integration relies on orthogonal behavior and execution models respectively capturing the functional and non-functional features of sub-systems. The construction towards guaranteed services can be achieved with composition of static (worst-case) execution models, while best-effort services can be constructed with statistical models. Given that each computing domain has, to some extent, formulated its own design flow of context-aware systems, the envisaged meet-in-the-middle integration approach maximizes the reuse of existing models and platforms, thus is promising for the highly-complex system design process.},

We argue that context awareness not only enables novel UbiComp applications but can also support dynamic regulation and configuration of privacy mechanisms. We propose a higher level context model that abstracts from low level details and contains only privacy relevant context features. Context changes in our model can trigger reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms or facilitate context-specific privacy recommendations to the user. Based on our model, we analyze potential privacy implications of context changes and discuss how these results could inform actual reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms.},

In this paper, we describe a new technique called SMART that uses application-level semantics to detect, assess, and adapt to sensor failures. SMART detects sensor failures at run-time by analyzing the relative behavior of multiple classifier instances trained to recognize the same set of activities based on different subsets of sensors. Once a failure is detected, SMART assesses its importance and adapts the classifier ensemble in attempt to avoid maintenance dispatch. Evaluation on three homes from two public datasets shows that SMART decreases the number of maintenance dispatches by 55% on average, identifies non-fail-stop failures at run-time with more than 85% accuracy, and improves the activity recognition accuracy under sensor failures by 15% on average.},

We achieve this visual scene understanding by leveraging a camera-phone's inertial sensors to lead to both a faster and more accurate automatic labeling of the regions of an image into semantic classes (e.g. sky, tree, building). We focus on letting a user train our system from scratch while out in the real world by annotating image regions in situ as training images are captured on a mobile device, making it possible to recognize new environments and new semantic classes on the fly. We show that our approach outperforms existing methods, while at the same time performing data collection, annotation, feature extraction, and image segment classification all on the same mobile device.},

Starting from the study of the sharing functionalities and how people use them, I aim at building a platform for efficiently sharing location, supported by a usable interface through which users can easily understand how sharing works and feel in control of their data.

 abstract = {Activity recognition using multiple body-worn sensors can directly monitor the movement of each body part and can recognize various activities accurately. However, using multiple sensors increases the chance of sensor failure or communication failure, and most current activity recognition algorithms do not work when failure occurs due to the difference (reduction) of the dimension of the feature vector from that of complete sensor data expected in system design time. Therefore, we compared three possible techniques to solves this problem on the feature value level: a classifier trained with reduced feature values, feature value compensation with multiple regression, and feature value compensation with kernel regression, in a no failure situation. All of these techniques do not depend on classification algorithms. While creating a regression model, which is in the training phase, requires relatively high computational power, compensation itself can work with low computational power. As overall results, kernel regression had the best performance that was the closest to the no failure situation. Also, the results imply that each sensor position has its own effective method and more accurate coping can be viable with the appropriate choice of the method.},

Obtaining labeled data for new apps is a "chicken-egg" problem. Without a reasonable amount of labeled data, apps cannot provide any service. But until an app provides useful service it is not worth installing and has no opportunity to collect user data. This paper aims to address this problem. Our intuition is that even though users are different, they exhibit similar patterns on certain sensing dimensions. For instance, different users may walk and drive at different speeds, but certain speeds will indicate driving for all users. These common patterns could be used as "seeds" to model new users through semi-supervised learning. We prototype a technique to automatically extract the commonalities to seed personalized inference models for new users. We evaluate the proposed technique through example apps and real world data.},

Therefore, keeping up with the dynamic change of urban space would be necessary, while it usually requires lots of efforts to understand newly visiting and daily changing living spaces. In order to explore and exploit the urban complexity from crowd-sourced lifelogs, we focus on location-based social network sites. In fact, due to the proliferation of location-based social networks, we can easily acquire massive crowd-sourced lifelogs interestingly indicating their experiences in the real space. In particular, we can conduct various novel urban analytics by monitoring crowd's experiences in an unprecedented way. In this paper, we particularly attempt to exploit crowd-sourced location-based lifelogs for generating a socio-cognitive map, whose purpose is to deliver much simplified and intuitive perspective of urban space. For the purpose, we measure socio-cognitive distance among urban clusters based on human mobility to represent accessibility of urban areas based on crowd's movement. Finally, we generate a socio-cognitive map reflecting the proposed socio-cognitive distances which have computed with massive geo-tagged tweets from Twitter.},

Both imperative and declarative languages have been investigated in this context. Declarative approaches require more abstract thinking and higher modeling effort but enable greater flexibility. A survey of related work suggests, however, that the high modeling effort of declarative approaches is prohibitive to their practical application. In contrast, imperative approaches lead to static control-flow and over-specification. Still, they are used, mainly due to their simplicity. Our approach supports a systematic transformation process from imperative models to declarative ones. Our method comprises an imperative, workflow-based language that we extended with novel declarative constructs and an algorithm for converting imperative models into declarative ones. Our approach requires only a modest level of declarative specification literacy for reaching a degree of flexibility that formerly only expert designers could achieve with hand-crafted declarative models.},

However, only few people are actually using smart spaces. One of the reasons for that is the lack of attention paid to user interfaces used to control the space. Both industrial and academic research is often focused on hardware and device interoperability issues. There is not enough studies about end-user mental models, how and why people want to control and program smart spaces. In this position paper, we propose a strategy of how to bring end-user programming in smart spaces into real life. Our idea is three-fold: 1) concentrate on users' mental models, 2) create intuitive ubiquitous user interface, which combines the direct interaction pattern and the magnetic poetry interface metaphor, and 3) install a control system in a public smart space, where a lot of people can use it on daily basis. We aim to conduct a long term user study, from which we are planning to get unique data about evolution of people's expectations and mental models in the context of smart space control.},

The trend of excessive information is, however, still ongoing, calling for further solutions to reduce a persons cognitive load or level of attention. Subliminal interaction techniques are considered a promising approach to deliver information to a person without causing much supplementary workload. This workshop aims at discussing the potential of subliminal perception to improve the information flow for human-computer interaction in the light of the fact that, up to now, the results have been mixed. One group of researchers has provided evidence that subliminal stimulation works, but the other has found that it does not, or even cannot, work. To clarify this issue, experts from various domains attending the workshop will discuss how subliminal effects can be scientifically supported or how a certain claim could be empirically refuted.},

It is envisioned that this trend will continue towards a further higher level of abstraction, allowing situation, activity and goal modeling, representation and inference, thus realizing the vision of ubiquitous computing. The proposed "mini-track" workshop intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from relevant fields to present and disseminate the latest accomplished and/or ongoing research on Situation, Activity and Situation Awareness (SAGAware) and their novel application in ubiquitous computing. It aims to facilitate knowledge transfer and synergy, bridge gaps between different research communities/groups, lay down foundation for common purposes, and help identify opportunities and challenges for interested researchers and technology and system developers.},

 abstract = {Smart environments are improving their performance and services by increasingly using ubiquitous sensing and complex inference mechanisms. However, this comes at a cost of reduced intelligibility, user trust and control. The Intelligibility Toolkit was developed to support the automatic generation and provision of explanations to help users understand context-aware inference. We have extended the toolkit to generate explanations for a wider range of inference models and to provide two styles of explanations --- rule traces and weights of evidence. We describe explanations generated from several inference models for a smart home dataset for activity recognition. This demonstrates the versatility of using the Intelligibility Toolkit to retain explanatory capabilities across different inference models.},

The optimum distribution of the error (magnitude and direction) in the field of view varies for different applications. However, the results can be used for finding the optimum parameters that are needed for designing a head-mounted gaze tracker.

 abstract = {Location prediction systems that attempt to determine the mobility patterns of individuals in their daily lives have become increasingly common in recent years. Approaches to this prediction task include eigenvalue decomposition [5], non-linear time series analysis of arrival times [10], and variable order Markov models [1]. However, these approaches all assume sufficient sets of training data. For new users, by definition, this data is typically not available, leading to poor predictive performance. Given that mobility is a highly personal behaviour, this represents a significant barrier to entry. Against this background, we present a novel framework to enhance prediction using information about the mobility habits of existing users. At the core of the framework is a hierarchical Bayesian model, a type of probabilistic semantic analysis [7], representing the intuition that the temporal features of the new user's location habits are likely to be similar to those of an existing user in the system. We evaluate this framework on the real life location habits of 38 users in the Nokia Lausanne dataset, showing that accuracy is improved by 16%, relative to the state of the art, when predicting the next location of new users.},

 abstract = {The ability to foresee the next moves of a user is crucial to ubiquitous computing. Disregarding major differences in individuals' routines, recent ground-breaking analysis on mobile phone data suggests high predictability in mobility. By nature, however, mobile phone data offer very low spatial and temporal resolutions. It remains largely unknown how the predictability changes with respect to different spatial/temporal scales. Using high-resolution GPS data, this paper investigates the scaling effects on predictability. Given specified spatial-temporal scales, recorded trajectories are encoded into long strings of distinct locations, and several information-theoretic measures of predictability are derived. Somewhat surprisingly, high predictability is still present at very high spatial/temporal resolutions. Moreover, the predictability is independent of the overall mobility area covered. This suggests highly regular mobility behaviors. Moreover, by varying the scales over a wide range, an invariance is observed which suggests that certain trade-offs between the predicting accuracy and spatial-temporal resolution are unavoidable. As many applications in ubiquitous computing concern mobility, these findings should have direct implications.},

Although the power consumption of accelerometers has already been highly optimized, this work introduces a novel sensing approach which lowers the power requirement for motion sensing by orders of magnitude. We present an ultra-low-power method for passively sensing body motion using static electric fields by measuring the voltage at any single location on the body. We present the feasibility of using this sensing approach to infer the amount and type of body motion anywhere on the body and demonstrate an ultra-low-power motion detector used to wake up more power-hungry sensors.

Such an occasion may be considered to represent a form of agency. Located within the technical and cultural context of the Internet of Things, this paper introduces a lineage for our relationship with objects from 1. Read Only, 2. Read and Write and 3. Read, Write and Act. The paper proceeds to establish the conditions for a third generation of Internet of Things by articulating the nature of networks, their structure and their capacity to support the principles of Actor-Network Theory which may lead to a condition in which objects may take on a form of agency. The paper further introduces an iPhone App entitled Take Me I'm Yours that operates as a working but speculative design project mimicking the conditions in which objects may talk to us. The designers speculate a design fiction in which object databases may begin to identify associations and propose 'actions' to a user. The application and demonstration at UbiComp 2012 will offer delegates an opportunity to experience a sense of what it may feel like in the future when objects may begin telling us what to do.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we explore reduction of search space in sensor data analytics using social network graph theory. Human centric social network allow graphical connect of individuals either based on familiarity or common intent. This facilitates people centric applications as they now operate on a much smaller data set. Extending this analogy to sensor networks, if sensors can be associated with meaningful social groups, it will reduce sensor data analytics and processing overhead for an application by a huge order. In this paper we explore how in Internet-of-Things sensors can be assigned to human beings who in turn are connected in social networks. Effectively in this way, sensors become part of a social network that results in a reduced data set for sensor data analytics.},

 abstract = {The bedroom environment can have a significant impact on the quality of a person's sleep. Experts recommend sleeping in a room that is cool, dark, quiet, and free from disruptors to ensure the best quality sleep. However, it is sometimes difficult for a person to assess which factors in the environment may be causing disrupted sleep. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and initial evaluation of a capture and access system, called Lullaby. Lullaby combines temperature, light, and motion sensors, audio and photos, and an off-the-shelf sleep sensor to provide a comprehensive recording of a person's sleep. Lullaby allows users to review graphs and access recordings of factors relating to their sleep quality and environmental conditions to look for trends and potential causes of sleep disruptions. In this paper, we report results of a feasibility study where participants (N=4) used Lullaby in their homes for two weeks. Based on our experiences, we discuss design insights for sleep technologies, capture and access applications, and personal informatics tools.},

In this paper, we present CrowdSense@Place (CSP), a framework that exploits a previously untapped resource -- opportunistically captured images and audio clips from smartphones -- to link place visits with place categories (e.g., store, restaurant). CSP combines signals based on location and user trajectories (using WiFi/GPS) along with various visual and audio place "hints" mined from opportunistic sensor data. Place hints include words spoken by people, text written on signs or objects recognized in the environment. We evaluate CSP with a seven-week, 36-user experiment involving 1,241 places in five locations around the world. Our results show that CSP can classify places into a variety of categories with an overall accuracy of 69%, outperforming currently available alternative solutions.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses reliable and accurate indoor localization using inertial sensors commonly found on commodity smartphones. We believe indoor positioning is an important primitive that can enable many ubiquitous computing applications. To tackle the challenges of drifting in estimation, sensitivity to phone position, as well as variability in user walking profiles, we have developed algorithms for reliable detection of steps and heading directions, and accurate estimation and personalization of step length. We've built an end-to-end localization system integrating these modules and an indoor floor map, without the need for infrastructure assistance. We demonstrated for the first time a meter-level indoor positioning system that is infrastructure free, phone position independent, user adaptive, and easy to deploy. We have conducted extensive experiments on users with smartphone devices, with over 50 subjects walking over an aggregate distance of over 40 kilometers. Evaluation results showed our system can achieve a mean accuracy of 1.5m for the in-hand case and 2m for the in-pocket case in a 31m×15m testing area.},

These machine learning based methods are designed for the general case of a person holding a mobile device in an unknown location and require only a single low-cost, low-power sensor: a triaxial accelerometer. We evaluate our methods in straight-path indoor walking experiments as well as in natural indoor walking settings. Experiments with 14 human participants to test user generalization show that our pose classifier correctly selects among four device poses with 94% accuracy compared to 82% for previous work, and our walking speed estimates are within 12-15% (straight/indoor walk) of ground truth compared to 17-22% for previous work. Implementation on a mobile phone demonstrates that both methods can run efficiently online.},

 abstract = {For bicycle and motorcycle riders, visibility is a constant concern for safe riding. For the designer, minimizing additional demands on the rider's attention is just as crucial when the device will be used while operating a vehicle, especially a bicycle or motorcycle. This riding glove uses common sensors to recognize a small set of hand gestures used by riders and then actuates appropriate LED patterns for enhanced gesture visibility. The configuration of LEDs translates the gesture to an illuminated directional chevron, extending functionality into the night hours. By equipping the device to recognize existing hand gestures, activation of directional LED signals is simplified allowing the rider to focus on riding while the glove responds to and extends the visibility of the rider's hand gestures. This context awareness allows the device to cooperate with the rider, rather than asking the rider to interact with the device.},

The method computes floor maps represented by polylines from a 3D point cloud based on precise frame-to-frame alignment. It aligns a reference frame with the floor and computes the frame-to-frame offsets from the continuous RGB-D input. Line segments at a certain height are extracted from the 3D point cloud, and are merged to form a polyline map, which can be further modified and annotated by users. The explored area is visualized as a sequence of polygons, providing users with the information on coverage.
