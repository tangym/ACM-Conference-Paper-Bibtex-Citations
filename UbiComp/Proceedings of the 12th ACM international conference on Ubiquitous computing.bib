 abstract = {We present a method to identify and localize people by leveraging existing CCTV camera infrastructure along with inertial sensors (accelerometer and magnetometer) within each person's mobile phones. Since a person's motion path, as observed by the camera, must match the local motion measurements from their phone, we are able to uniquely identify people with the phones' IDs by detecting the statistical dependence between the phone and camera measurements. For this, we express the problem as consisting of a two-measurement HMM for each person, with one camera measurement and one phone measurement. Then we use a maximum a posteriori formulation to find the most likely ID assignments. Through sensor fusion, our method largely bypasses the motion correspondence problem from computer vision and is able to track people across large spatial or temporal gaps in sensing. We evaluate the system through simulations and experiments in a real camera network testbed.},

 abstract = {Long-term personal GPS data is useful for many UbiComp services such as traffic monitoring and environmental impact assessment. However, inference attacks on such traces can reveal private information including home addresses and schedules. We asked 32 participants from 12 households to collect 2 months of GPS data, and showed it to them in visualizations. We explored if they understood how their individual privacy concerns mapped onto 5 location obfuscation schemes (which they largely did), which obfuscation schemes they were most comfortable with (Mixing, Deleting data near home, and Randomizing), how they monetarily valued their location data, and if they consented to share their data publicly. 21/32 gave consent to publish their data, though most households' members shared at different levels, which indicates a lack of awareness of privacy interrelationships. Grounded in real decisions about real data, our findings highlight the potential for end-user involvement in obfuscation of their own location data.},

This work explores the use of the home powerline as a large distributed antenna capable of receiving signals from ultra-low-power wireless sensor nodes and thus allowing nodes to be detected at ranges that are otherwise impractical with traditional over-the-air reception. We present the design and implementation of small ultra-low-power 27 MHz sensor nodes that transmit their data by coupling over the powerline to a single receiver attached to the powerline in the home. We demonstrate the ability of our general purpose wireless sensor nodes to provide whole-home coverage while consuming less than 1 mW of power when transmitting (65 Â¼W consumed in our custom CMOS transmitter). This is the lowest power transmitter to date compared to those found in traditional whole-home wireless systems.},

We explore the differences between these two types of sharing by conducting a comparative two-week study with nine participants. We found significant differences in terms of users' decisions about what location information to share, their privacy concerns, and how privacy-preserving their disclosures were.

However, the ambitions for ubiquitous computing typically go further. For example 'ambient intelligence' aims to provide users with a constant serviced cocoon that envelopes them in appropriate information, communication and services, protecting, enabling and empowering them wherever they are. We share some of these visions, but argue that profound difficulties stand in their way: Far from simplifying computing, ubiquity risks making it much more complex and confusing, e.g. by obscuring the relation between action and reaction. In this keynote we will discuss some of the challenges in realizing the promises of pervasive technologies and present ideas for the design of technology that supports learning, exploration and continued development. To this end people need to be able to grasp, both physically and conceptually, what technologies are doing and could do for them. We have termed this 'palpable computing'.},

In our study, 30 participants completed 10 trials each of 11 manual tasks chosen to represent a set of common task-components (e.g., cutting, folding) found in many everyday activities such as crafts, cooking, and hobby electronics. Fifteen participants received only on-screen instructions, and 15 received both on-screen and micro-projected instructions. In contrast to prior work, which focused only on whole tasks, our study examines the benefit of augmenting common task instructions. The augmented instructions improved participants' performance overall; however, we show that in certain cases when projected guides and physical objects visually interfered, projected elements caused increased errors. Our results demonstrate that examining effectiveness at an instruction level is both useful and necessary, and provide insight into the design of systems that help users perform everyday tasks.},

 abstract = {On behalf of the entire organizing committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 12th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing. After North America (2009) and Asia (2008), the UbiComp conference series returns again to Europe, to the vibrant port city of Copenhagen, Denmark. 2010 marks the 12th installment of a conference that truly captures the wide variety of research activities in the diverse field of ubiquitous computing, encompassing research from, e.g., Human Computer Interaction, Mobile Computing, Location and Sensing Technology, Middleware and Systems, and Programming Models and Tools. Each UbiComp conference represents a snapshot of our field, capturing the state-of-the-art in technology, the research challenges we are addressing, as well as the people that form the UbiComp community. Each year's proceedings represent an opportunity to learn about new areas and identify upcoming research opportunities, and this year is no exception. UbiComp 2010 continues the tradition of a single-track technical program that allows participants to experience the entire program in a variety of sessions, ranging from context awareness to location sharing, from home infrastructures to novel interactions, and from persuasive computing to physiological sensing. This year our international Program Committee, composed of 26 of the leading researchers in the field of ubiquitous computing, evaluated 202 submissions - 152 full papers and 50 notes. Using a multi-phase review process, initially each submission was reviewed by at least one member of the program committee and two or more external reviewers. Of the 202 submissions, 131 were evaluated by 1-3 additional PC members. After an online discussion, 9 submissions were auto-accepted and 79 submissions were chosen for further review and discussion at a 2-day PC meeting. In total, the Program Committee and 301 external reviewers spent countless hours to provided feedback to the authors through 848 reviews. After this rigorous process, a total of 39 submissions - 32 full papers and 7 notes - were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 19.3%. We are pleased to note this acceptance rate is the highest in the twelve-year history of the Ubicomp conference thus far. We feel our selective review process has resulted in a high-quality set of published papers. A sub-committee discussed and selected five of the 39 accepted papers to be recognized in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. Of these five, one stood out as the best paper of Ubicomp 2010. This year also sees a significantly expanded adjunct program, accepting 18 demos (1 also as video), 26 posters (3 also as videos), and 10 videos (including the shared ones), making a total of 50 accepted adjunct papers out of 79 submissions. For the first time, we have actively encouraged authors of accepted full papers and notes to also submit a poster, video, or demo of their work, in order to better engage the audience and stimulate face to face discussions. To properly reflect the significance of the work represented in the adjunct program, these submissions also see a much tighter integration in the main program, with video presentations interspersed with the technical presentations of the main track, and posters and demos presented during breaks and the first day's welcome reception. The workshop program has more than doubled the number of workshops, featuring a record-breaking 14 scheduled workshops that cover both traditional UbiComp topics (e.g., context awareness, health, and design) and novel developments (e.g., crowdsourcing, e-energy, and urban computing). Last but not least, Morten Kyng's keynote on "Making dreams come true -- or how to avoid a living nightmare" will offer a critical look at the promises of ubiquitous computing and present design ideas for helping people make sense of this ever increasing technological environment.},

 abstract = {A fairly common modern setting entails users, each in possession of a personal wireless device, wanting to communicate securely, via their devices. If these users (and their devices) have no prior association, a new security context must be established. In order to prevent potential attacks, the initial context (association) establishment process must involve only the intended devices and their users. A number of methods for initial secure association of two devices have been proposed; their usability factors have been explored and compared extensively. However, a more challenging problem of initial secure association of a group of devices (and users) has not received much attention. Although a few secure group association methods have been proposed, their usability aspects have not been studied, especially, in a comparative manner. This paper discusses desirable features and evaluation criteria for secure group association, identifies suitable methods and presents a comparative usability study. Results show that some simple methods (e.g., peer- or leader-based number comparisons) are quite attractive for small groups, being fast, reasonably secure and well-received by users.},

 abstract = {Battery interfaces provide important feedback about how much time users can continue using their mobile devices. Based on this information, they may develop mental models of the types of activities, tasks, and applications they can use before needing to recharge. Many of today's battery interfaces tend to report energy in coarse granularities or are highly inaccurate. As a result, users may find it difficult to depend on the estimates given. We conducted a survey with 104 participants to understand how users interact with various mobile battery interfaces. Based on the survey results, we designed and prototyped a task-centered battery interface on a mobile device that shows more accurate information about how long individual and combinations of tasks with several applications can be performed. Our pilot study of eight users demonstrated that fine-grained information separated by tasks can help users be more effective with and increase their understanding of their device's battery usage.},

 abstract = {An important question in behavioral epidemiology and public health is to understand how individual behavior is affected by illness and stress. Although changes in individual behavior are intertwined with contagion, epidemiologists today do not have sensing or modeling tools to quantitatively measure its effects in real-world conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel application of ubiquitous computing. We use mobile phone based co-location and communication sensing to measure characteristic behavior changes in symptomatic individuals, reflected in their total communication, interactions with respect to time of day (e.g., late night, early morning), diversity and entropy of face-to-face interactions and movement. Using these extracted mobile features, it is possible to predict the health status of an individual, without having actual health measurements from the subject. Finally, we estimate the temporal information flux and implied causality between physical symptoms, behavior and mental health.},

ElectriSense relies on the fact that most modern consumer electronics and fluorescent lighting employ switch mode power supplies (SMPS) to achieve high efficiency. These power supplies continuously generate high frequency electromagnetic interference (EMI) during operation that propagates throughout a home's power wiring. We show both analytically and by in-home experimentation that EMI signals are stable and predictable based on the device's switching frequency characteristics. Unlike past transient noise-based solutions, this new approach provides the ability for EMI signatures to be applicable across homes while still being able to differentiate between similar devices in a home. We have evaluated our solution in seven homes, including one six-month deployment. Our results show that ElectriSense can identify and classify the usage of individual devices with a mean accuracy of 93.82%.},

However, cell tower triangulation methods require the knowledge of the actual locations of cell towers. Because the locations of cell towers are not publicly available, these methods often need to use estimated tower locations obtained through wardriving. This paper provides the first large scale study of the accuracy of two existing methods for cell tower localization using wardriving data. The results show that naively applying these methods results in very large localization errors. We analyze the causes for these errors and conclude that one can localize a cell accurately only if it falls within the area covered by the wardriving trace. We further propose a bounding technique to select the cells that fall within the area covered by the wardriving trace and identify a cell combining optimization that can further reduce the localization error by half.},

We derive a taxonomy of different place naming methods, and show that factors such as a person's perceived familiarity with a place and the entropy of that place (i.e. the variety of people who visit it) strongly influence the way people refer to it when interacting with others. We also present a machine learning model for predicting how people name places.

We logged users interaction with the interfaces and analysed content posted by them on our own and other web sites to observe and evaluate how they relate to such novel systems, taking measures to protect their privacy.

Moreover, the improvement in the latter increased from 43% to 56% when we considered only participants that had any interest in games, which reveals the importance of applying persuasive techniques in a personalized manner.

However, existing work typically focuses on moderately affluent homeowners who have relative autonomy with respect to their home, or does not address socio-economic status, class, and other related issues. For the 30% of the U.S. population who rent their homes, many key decisions regarding energy use must be negotiated with a landlord. Because energy use impacts the bottom line of both landlords and tenants, this can be a source of conflict in the landlord/tenant relationship. Ubicomp technologies for reducing energy use in rental units must engage with landlord/tenant conflicts to be successful. Unfortunately, little detailed knowledge is available about the impact of landlord/tenant conflicts on energy use. We present an analysis of a series of qualitative studies with landlords and tenants. We argue that a consideration of multiple stakeholders, and the power imbalances among them, will drive important new research questions and lead to more widely applicable solutions.

 abstract = {Local search engines are very popular but limited. We present Hapori, a next-generation local search technology for mobile phones that not only takes into account location in the search query but richer context such as the time, weather and the activity of the user. Hapori also builds behavioral models of users and exploits the similarity between users to tailor search results to personal tastes rather than provide static geo-driven points of interest. We discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of the Hapori framework which combines data mining, information preserving embedding and distance metric learning to address the challenge of creating efficient multidimensional models from context-rich local search logs. Our experimental results using 80,000 queries extracted from search logs show that contextual and behavioral similarity information can improve the relevance of local search results by up to ten times when compared to the results currently provided by commercially available search engine technology.},

Over a six week period, VoiceYourView was deployed in a public space and 2000 design critiques were collected from 600 people. The paper shows that people are capable of providing creative input on their environment using unstructured speech or text and that a good proportion of these comments are actionable. The paper also investigates the use of public displays to auto-summarize comments left by the public so far. Although there is anecdotal evidence that this encourages participation, an experiment found that filtering comments (e.g., to display only positive responses) had no effect on what people had to say.},

@proceedings{Landay:2011:2030112,
 abstract = {On behalf of the organizing committee, it is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 13th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing. This is the third time the UbiComp conference series has come to Asia. This year's conference in Beijing, China, follows Seoul, Korea (2008) and Tokyo, Japan (2005). UbiComp is a conference that truly captures the wide variety of research activities in the diverse field of ubiquitous computing, encompassing research from, e.g., Human-Computer Interaction, Mobile Computing, Location and Sensing Technology, Machine Learning, Middleware and Systems, and Programming Models and Tools. September 2011 also marks a historic date in the history of Ubicomp. It is exactly 20 years from when Dr. Mark Weiser's historic article, "The Computer for the Twenty-First Century," appeared in Scientific American. This article is acclaimed for widely publicizing the idea of Ubicomp in the research community and setting the goals for the early years of the field. We will mark this historic occasion with a special panel in tribute to the late Dr. Weiser. Our panel of luminaries, including those who worked with Dr. Weiser at Xerox PARC, as well as his contemporaries who were influenced by his work at the time, will reminisce on Mark's predictions as well as present their view of where the field should move going forward. Each UbiComp conference represents a snapshot of our field, capturing the state-of-the-art in technology, the research challenges we are addressing, as well as the people that form the UbiComp community. Each year's proceedings represent an opportunity to learn about new areas and identify upcoming research opportunities, and this year is no exception. UbiComp 2011 continues the tradition of a single-track program that allows participants to experience the entire program in a variety of sessions, ranging from context awareness to location sharing, from home infrastructures to novel interactions, and from persuasive computing to sensing. This year our international Program Committee, composed of 28 of the leading researchers in the field, evaluated a record number of 302 submissions --- 234 full papers and 68 notes. Using a multi-phase review process, initially each submission was reviewed by at least one member of the PC and three or more external reviewers. Of the 302 submissions, 118 were evaluated by 1-2 additional PC members and discussed at a 2- day PC meeting held on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. In total, the Program Committee and 531 external reviewers spent countless hours to provide feedback to the authors through 1343 reviews. After this rigorous process, a total of 50 submissions --- 44 full papers and 6 notes --- were accepted for publication in these proceedings, representing an overall acceptance rate of 16.6%. We feel our selective review process has resulted in a high-quality set of published papers. A sub-committee discussed and selected five of the 50 accepted papers to be recognized in these proceedings for their particular level of quality. Of these five, one stood out as the best paper of UbiComp 2011. This year also sees a high quality adjunct program, accepting 23 demos, 7 videos, and 34 posters, for a total of 56 accepted adjunct papers out of 85 submissions (note that several accepted adjunct submissions appear in multiple categories, but are only counted once in the acceptance numbers). Continued from UbiComp 2010, we encouraged authors of accepted full papers and notes to also submit a poster, video, or demo of their work, to better engage the audience and stimulate discussion. To properly reflect the significance of the work represented in the adjunct program, these submissions also see a tighter integration in the main program, with video presentations interspersed with the technical presentations of the main track, and posters and demos presented during lunch breaks. The workshop program has 13 workshops that cover both traditional Ubicomp topics (e.g., context awareness, location-based services, mobile sensing, health, and design) and newer topics (e.g., crowdsourcing and urban computing). This year, we launched the first tutorial program in UbiComp conference history. We offered five tutorials by leading experts on the topics of activity recognition, Android development, evaluation, ubicomp research in the wild, and urban sensing. We also experimented with a new Visions of Ubicomp Film Contest. Last but not least, Jan Chipchase's keynote will offer a provocative look at the future of ubiquitous computing in new settings. We hope you find this year's program interesting, useful and enjoyable. Several organizations and people contributed to the success of UbiComp 2011 and we are grateful for their support. First, we would like to thank Tsinghua University for hosting and helping to organize UbiComp. We also appreciate the sponsorship of ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGMOBILE and ACM SIGSPATIAL. Finally, the conference could not occur without the kind financial support of our benefactors Microsoft Research, Shanda, NSFC, NSF, Qualcomm, Google, IGRS, HTC, Nokia, Intel, AutoDesk, Opzoon, and Telezoon.},

@inproceedings{Campbell:2010:WMS:1864349.1864378,
 abstract = {We present WATTR, a novel self-powered water activity sensor that utilizes residential water pressure impulses as both a powering and sensing source. Consisting of a power harvesting circuit, piezoelectric sensor, ultra-low-power 16-bit microcontroller, 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and a 433 MHz wireless transmitter, WATTR is capable of sampling home water pressure at 33 Hz and transmitting over 3 m when any water fixture in the home is opened or closed. WATTR provides an alternative sensing solution to the power intensive Bluetooth-based sensor used in the HydroSense project by Froehlich et al. [2] for single-point whole-home water usage. We demonstrate WATTR as a viable self-powered sensor capable of monitoring and transmitting water usage data without the use of a battery. Unlike other water-based power harvesters, WATTR does not waste water to power itself. We discuss the design, implementation, and experimental verification of the WATTR device.},

Participatory sensing initiatives organize individuals to gather sensed information using mobile devices through cooperative data collection. A major factor in the success of these data collection projects is sustained, high quality participation. However, since data capture requires a time and energy commitment from individuals, incentives are often introduced to motivate participants. In this work, we investigate the use of micro-payments as an incentive model. We define a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of incentives and report on findings from a pilot study using various micro-payment schemes in a university campus sustainability initiative.},

@proceedings{Bardram:2010:1864431,
 abstract = {UbiComp has always included a variety of tracks, including posters, videos, demos, doctoral colloquium and workshops, as well as the main papers and notes track, adding to the richness of the conference and allowing people to present cutting edge work. This year, we are innovating in a number of ways in the posters/demos/videos tracks. First, instead of asking authors to submit separately for each sub-track, we combined them into a single multimodal track using PCS. Reviewers were assigned by the chairs of each track that was chosen by the authors, and were asked to rate work by its value in each of the formats. Out of 79 multimodal submissions, we accepted 18 demos (1 also as video), 26 posters (3 also as videos), and 10 videos (including the shared ones), making a total of 50 accepted adjunct papers out of 79 submissions. Second, we invited all accepted paper and note authors to additionally participate in the adjunct tracks, allowing their work to be shown in more than just the presentation format. At the time of writing we do not yet have the final numbers in, but we hope this allows the audience to see work showcased in the most appropriate format. Third, we are inviting additional demos both from local participants and international labs in order to build a large and exciting interactive programme. Fourth, following Pervasive 2010's successful lead, we are integrating videos into the main sessions to maximize their audience and impact. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, we are extending the adjunct presentations from being confined to a single reception to multiple sessions throughout the conference. This means presenters have a chance to present on one day and then see other demos and posters on another day - something we've been asked for at town halls in the past. In order to achieve this we are cutting out the one minute madness; while a fun event, the time spent on this will instead be used to have more demo/poster sessions which are fun and informative. In addition to the posters/demos/videos tracks, UbiComp 2010 continues its tradition of inviting excellent doctoral candidates to present and discuss their doctoral research in a one-day Doctoral Colloquium preceding the main technical program. During the Colloquium, students receive valuable feedback and suggestions from their peers and a panel of invited industry and academic researchers. This year's DC accepted exciting research abstracts from 10 senior-level PhD students representing institutions in 6 different countries.},

 abstract = {Context-aware applications should be intelligible so users can better understand how they work and improve their trust in them. However, providing intelligibility is non-trivial and requires the developer to understand how to generate explanations from application decision models. Furthermore, users need different types of explanations and this complicates the implementation of intelligibility. We have developed the Intelligibility Toolkit that makes it easy for application developers to obtain eight types of explanations from the most popular decision models of context-aware applications. We describe its extensible architecture, and the explanation generation algorithms we developed. We validate the usefulness of the toolkit with three canonical applications that use the toolkit to generate explanations for end-users.},

In this paper, we present the results of a study conducted in three public schools that use an educational and behavioral intervention for the instruction of social skills in changing situational contexts. The results of this study led to the concept of interaction immediacy to help children maintain appropriate spatial boundaries, reply to conversation initiators, disengage appropriately at the end of an interaction, and identify potential communication partners. We describe design principles for Ubicomp technologies to support interaction immediacy and present an example design. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we present an understanding of social skills in mobile and dynamic contexts. Second, we introduce the concept of interaction immediacy and show its effectiveness as a guiding principle for the design of Ubicomp applications.},

Today our understanding of people's location sharing privacy preferences remains very limited, including how these preferences are impacted by the type of location tracking device or the nature of the locations visited. To address this gap, we deployed Locaccino, a mobile location sharing system, in a four week long field study, where we examined the behavior of study participants (n=28) who shared their location with their acquaintances (n=373.) Our results show that users appear more comfortable sharing their presence at locations visited by a large and diverse set of people. Our study also indicates that people who visit a wider number of places tend to also be the subject of a greater number of requests for their locations. Over time these same people tend to also evolve more sophisticated privacy preferences, reflected by an increase in time- and location-based restrictions. We conclude by discussing the implications our findings.},
