 abstract = {Despite the active research into, and the development of, human activity recognition over the decades, existing techniques still have several limitations, in particular, poor performance due to insufficient ground-truth data and little support of intra-class variability of activities (i.e., the same activity may be performed in different ways by different individuals, or even by the same individuals with different time frames). Aiming to tackle these two issues, in this paper, we present a robust activity recognition approach by extracting the intrinsic shared structures from activities to handle intra-class variability, and the approach is embedded into a semi-supervised learning framework by utilizing the learned correlations from both labeled and easily-obtained unlabeled data simultaneously. We use l2,1 minimization on both loss function and regularizations to effectively resist outliers in noisy sensor data and improve recognition accuracy by discerning underlying commonalities from activities. Extensive experimental evaluations on four community-contributed public datasets indicate that with little training samples, our proposed approach outperforms a set of classical supervised learning methods as well as those recently proposed semi-supervised approaches.},

Sharing of mobile sensor data, especially physiological data, raise different privacy challenges, that of protecting private behaviors that can be revealed from time series of sensor data. Existing privacy mechanisms rely on noise addition and data perturbation. But the accuracy requirement on inferences drawn from physiological data, together with well-established limits within which these data values occur, render traditional privacy mechanisms inapplicable. In this work, we define a new behavioral privacy metric based on differential privacy and propose a novel data substitution mechanism to protect behavioral privacy. We evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using 660 hours of ECG, respiration, and activity data collected from 43 participants and demonstrate that it is possible to retain meaningful utility, in terms of inference accuracy (90%), while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive behaviors.},

Unfortunately, indoor air quality (IAQ) may be two to five times worse than the air outdoors, and is often overlooked. Existing IAQ monitoring technologies focus on IAQ measurements and visualization. However, the lack of information about the pollution sources as well as the seriousness of the pollution makes people feel powerless and frustrated, resulting in the ignorance of the polluted air at their homes. In this work, we fill this critical gap by presenting AirSense, an intelligent home-based IAQ sensing system that is able to automatically detect pollution events, identify pollution sources, estimate personal exposure to indoor air pollution, and provide actionable suggestions to help people improve IAQ. We have deployed AirSense at five homes to evaluate its performance and investigate how users interact with it. We demonstrate that AirSense can accurately detect pollution events, identify pollution sources, and forecast IAQ information within five minutes in both controlled and real-world settings. We further show the great potential of AirSense in increasing users' awareness of IAQ and helping them better manage IAQ at their homes.},

With the help of advanced AR technology (e.g. object recognition), users can effectively distinguish multiple objects of different types. However, these techniques can only offer limited degrees of distinctions among different objects and cannot provide more inherent information about these objects. In this paper, we leverage RFID technology to further label different objects with RFID tags. We deploy additional RFID antennas to the COTS depth camera and propose a continuous scanning-based scheme to scan the objects, i.e., the system continuously rotates and samples the depth of field and RF-signals from these tagged objects. In this way, by pairing the tags with the objects according to the correlations between the depth of field and RF-signals, we can accurately identify and distinguish multiple tagged objects to realize the vision of "tell me what I see" from the augmented reality system. For example, in front of multiple unknown people wearing RFID tagged badges in public events, our system can identify these people and further show their inherent information from the RFID tags, such as their names, jobs, titles, etc. We have implemented a prototype system to evaluate the actual performance. The experiment results show that our solution achieves an average match ratio of 91% in distinguishing up to dozens of tagged objects with a high deployment density.},

However, smartphone manufacturers and most of the mobile computing research community make a simplifying assumption that all smartphone users are similar or, at best, constitute a small number of user types, based on their behaviors. Manufacturers design phones for the broadest audience and hope they work for all users. Researchers mostly analyze data from smartphone-based user studies and report results without accounting for the many different groups of people that make up the user base of smartphones. In this work, we challenge these elementary characterizations of smartphone users and show evidence of the existence of a much more diverse set of users. We analyzed one month of application usage from 106,762 Android users and discovered 382 distinct types of users based on their application usage behaviors, using our own two-step clustering and feature ranking selection approach. Our results have profound implications on the reproducibility and reliability of mobile computing studies, design and development of applications, determination of which apps should be pre-installed on a smartphone and, in general, on the smartphone usage experience for different types of users.},

 abstract = {There are two broad categories of citywide human mobility, routine, composed of daily or periodic travel, and rare, which occurs during events such as the Olympic Games or natural disasters. State-of-the-art studies have shown that routine mobility patterns can be modeled stochastically, while rare human mobility modeling, essential to a variety of urban computing scenarios, such as emergency management and traffic regulation, is a much more challenging and understudied problem. Instead of training a rare-event-specific human mobility model, which suffers from the particularity of the rare events, in this paper we provide a new insight into rare events and propose a novel algorithm, CityCoupling, which establishes an intercity spatial mapping that uses human mobility in one city as input and reproduces human mobility in another city. More intuitively, we attempt to answer the question "What if this rare event happened in another city?". To find the optimal intercity spatial mapping, we utilize an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a probabilistic geographical correspondence matrix by regarding intercity trajectory matching as latent variables. Thereafter, a Gibbs sampling-based multiple hidden Markov model generates simulated trajectories. We apply our approach to a large mobile phone GPS dataset in Japan and determine the spatial mapping between Tokyo and Osaka to transfer the human mobility at the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake in Tokyo, which was heavily affected, to simulate what might have occurred if Osaka had been struck by the earthquake. We conduct the evaluation by assuming that New Year's Countdown is a rare event that occurs simultaneously in both Tokyo and Osaka, and thus we quantitatively compare our simulation with the ground truth in Osaka.},

A common class of algorithms, which has seen uptake in ubiquitous computing, is supervised machine learning algorithms. Such algorithms are trained to make predictions based on a set of features (selected at training time). However, features needed at prediction time (such as mobile information that impacts battery life, or information collected from users via experience sampling) may be costly to collect. In addition, both cost and value of a feature may change dynamically based on real-world context (such as battery life or user location) and prediction context (what features are already known, and what their values are). We contribute a framework for dynamically trading off feature cost against prediction quality at prediction time. We demonstrate this work in the context of three prediction tasks: providing prospective tenants estimates for energy costs in potential homes, estimating momentary stress levels from both sensed and user-provided mobile data, and classifying images to facilitate opportunistic device interactions. Our results show that while our approach to cost-sensitive feature selection is up to 45% less costly than competing approaches, error rates are equivalent or better.},

Based on these findings, we develop novel methods for unobtrusively and continuously assessing alertness. In estimating response time, our model achieves a root-mean-square error of 80.64 milliseconds, which is significantly lower than the 500ms threshold used as a standard indicator of impaired cognitive ability.

While prior work used abstract objects or dots as targets, we explore the use of Pursuits with text (read-and-pursue). Thereby we address the challenge that eye movements performed while reading interfere with the pursuit movements. Results from two user studies (N=37) show that Pursuits with text is feasible and can achieve similar accuracy as non text-based pursuit approaches. While calibration is less accurate, it integrates smoothly with reading and allows areas of the display the user is looking at to be identified.},

 abstract = {Toothbrushing plays an important role in daily dental plaque removal for preventive dentistry. Prior work has investigated improvements on toothbrushing with sensing technologies. But existing toothbrushing support focuses mostly on estimating brushing coverage. Users thus only have indirect information about how well their toothbrushing removes dental plaque. We present LumiO, a toothbrush that offers users continuous feedback on the amount of plaque on teeth. Lumio uses a well-known method for plaque detection, called Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence (QLF). QLF exploits a red fluorescence property that bacterium in the plaque demonstrates when a blue-violet ray is cast. Blue-violet light excites this fluorescence property, and a camera with an optical filter can capture plaque in pink. We incorporate this technology into an electric toothbrush to achieve improvements in performance on plaque removal in daily dental care. This paper first discusses related work in sensing for oral activities and interaction as well as dental care with technologies. We then describe the principles of QLF, the hardware design of LumiO, and our vision-based plaque detection method. Our evaluations show that the vision-based plaque detection method with three machine learning techniques can achieve F-measures of 0.68 -- 0.92 under user-dependent training. Qualitative evidence also suggests that study participants were able to have improved awareness of plaque and build confidence on their toothbrushing.},

We explore how designs can support people when they lapse in tracking, considering how to design data representations for a person who lapses in Fitbit use. Through a survey of 141 people who had lapsed in using Fitbit, we identified three use patterns and four perspectives on tracking. Participants then viewed seven visual representations of their Fitbit data and seven approaches to framing this data. Participant Fitbit use and perspective on tracking influenced their preference, which we surface in a series of contrasts. Specifically, our findings guide selecting appropriate aggregations from Fitbit use (e.g., aggregate more when someone has less data), choosing an appropriate framing technique from tracking perspective (e.g., ensure framing aligns with how the person feels about tracking), and creating appropriate social comparisons (e.g., portray the person positively compared to peers). We conclude by discussing how these contrasts suggest new designs and opportunities in other tracking domains.},

Grounded on this result, we model a set of application level features derived from smartphone usage of 10 users to detect engagement of a usage session using a Random Forest classifier. Finally, we apply this model to train a variety of contextual factors acquired from smartphone usage logs of 130 users to predict user engagement using an SVM classifier with a F1-Score of 0.82.

By presenting a proof-of-concept system, WritingHacker, we show the usage of mobile devices to collect the sound of victims' handwriting, and to extract handwriting-specific features for machine learning based analysis. WritingHacker focuses on the situation where the victim's handwriting follows certain print style. An attacker can keep a mobile device, such as a common smart-phone, touching the desk used by the victim to record the audio signals of handwriting. Then the system can provide a word-level estimate for the content of the handwriting. To reduce the impacts of various writing habits and writing locations, the system utilizes the methods of letter clustering and dictionary filtering. Our prototype system's experimental results show that the accuracy of word recognition reaches around 50% - 60% under certain conditions, which reveals the danger of privacy leakage through the sound of handwriting.},

Advances in methods where regular population patterns with respect to factors such as holidays or weekdays are extracted have provided successful results in irregularity detection. With large-scale crowded events such as fireworks, it is crucial that there be enough time to take countermeasures against the irregular congestion, i.e., irregularity prediction. It remains a tough challenge to predict population from GPS trace logs with existing methods. To tackle this problem, we focus here on route search logs, since aggregation of the location-oriented queries of individual plans serves as a mirror of short-term city-scale events, in contrast to GPS mobility logs. This paper presents a brand new framework for city-scale event prediction: CityProphet. By our observation of data where the route search logs related to a future event are in most cases repeatable and accumulated in proportion as the event draws near, we are able to leverage the divergence between the above two properties to predict city-scale irregular events. We demonstrate through experiments using the transit app logs of over 370 million queries that our approach can successfully predict city-scale crowded events one week in advance.},

MaTrack does not require any offline training compared to existing signature-based systems and is insensitive to changes in environment.

In this paper, we present initial results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive smartphone sensor data is collected from 21 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-8.5 months. Our results indicate that there are statistically significant associations between automatically tracked behavioral features related to sleep, mobility, conversations, smart-phone usage and self-reported indicators of mental health in schizophrenia. Using these features we build inference models capable of accurately predicting aggregated scores of mental health indicators in schizophrenia with a mean error of 7.6% of the score range. Finally, we discuss results on the level of personalization that is needed to account for the known variations within people. We show that by leveraging knowledge from a population with schizophrenia, it is possible to train accurate personalized models that require fewer individual-specific data to quickly adapt to new users.},

In this paper, we investigate notifications in multi-device environments by analyzing the results of a week-long in-situ study with 16 participants. We used the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and recorded the participants' interaction with smartphones, smartwatches, tablets and PCs. Disregarding the type or content of notifications, we found that the smartphone is the preferred device on which to be notified. Further, we found that the proximity to the device, whether it is currently being used and the user's current location can be used to predict if the user wants to receive notifications on a device. The findings can be used to design future multi-device aware smart notification systems.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have introduced co-location attacks as a powerful way to extract social information from location traces. However, these attacks all rely by some means on the position of targeted users. This requires the attacker to be able to locate either the user or the sensors detecting the user. Implicitly, it also forbids the use of these attacks on devices whose location is unknown. In this paper, we consider attack scenarios where the attacker has no position information on users and devices sensing users. Such attack scenarios typically fit Internet of Things use-cases, where low-end devices are scattered in an environment that is unknown to the attacker: the sole source of information is a set of timestamped user/sensor proximity logs. To exploit proximity logs, we describe Loca, a location-oblivious co-location attack. Our approach exploits location-oblivious logs in two steps: i) we exploit users' flows between sensors to construct a virtual map of the sensors, and ii) we conduct a co-location attack based on that virtual map. Our tests on both synthetic and real datasets match up to 90% of the targeted social network with a surprisingly low number of sensors. These results greatly extend the scope of such co-location attacks, and hopefully awareness about their threat.},

Inspired by the excellent work of relevant scholars, we turn to explore the field of human-computer interaction using finger-grained gestures under WiFi environment. In this paper, we present Wi-Finger - the first solution using ubiquitous wireless signals to achieve number text input in WiFi devices. We implement a prototype of WiFinger on a commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure. Our scheme is based on the key intuition that while performing a certain gesture, the fingers of a user move in a unique formation and direction and thus generate a unique pattern in the time series of Channel State Information (CSI) values. WiFinger is deigned to recognize a set of finger-grained gestures, which are further used to realize continuous text input in off-the-shelf WiFi devices. As the results show, WiFinger achieves up to 90.4% average classification accuracy for recognizing 9 digits finger-grained gestures from American Sign Language (ASL), and its average accuracy for single individual number text input in desktop reaches 82.67% within 90 digits.},

 abstract = {When a person seeks another person's attention, it is of prime importance to assess how interruptible the other person is. Since smartphones are ubiquitously used as communication media these days, interruptibility prediction on smartphones has started to attract great interest from both academia and industry. Previous studies, in general, attempted to model interruptibility using the behaviors at the current moment and in the immediate past (e.g., 5 minutes before). However, a person's interruptibility at a certain moment is indeed affected by his/her preceding behaviors for several reasons. Motivated by this long-term effect, in this paper we propose a novel methodology of extracting features based on past behaviors from smartphone sensor data. The primary difference from previous studies is that we systematically consider a longer history of up to a day in addition to the current point and the immediate past. To represent behaviors in a day accurately and compactly, our methodology divides a day into multiple timeslots and then, for each timeslot, derives relevant features such as the temporal shapes of the time series of the sensor data. In order to verify the advantage of our methodology, we collected a data set of smartphone usage from 25 participants for four weeks and obtained a license to a large-scale public data set constructed from 907 users over approximately nine months. The experimental results on the two data sets show that looking back to the beginning of the current day improves prediction accuracy by up to 16% and 7%, respectively, compared with the baseline and state-of-the-art methods.},

To the best of our knowledge, no existing work studies this problem directly and the work to reduce GPS signal errors by considering hardware aspect is the most relevant. Consequently, this work is the first attempt to solve the problem of locating one GPS position to a road segment. We study the problem in a data-driven view to make this process ubiquitous by proposing a tractable, efficient and robust generative model. In addition, we extend our solution to the real application scenario, i.e., taxi-hailing service, and propose an approach to further improve the result accuracy by considering destination information. We use the real taxi GPS data to evaluate our approach. The results show that our approach outperforms all the existing approaches significantly while maintaining robustness, and it can achieve an accuracy as high as 90% in some situations.},

While a large body of research has been focused on identifying and recommending POIs, there are few studies on characterizing the life cycle of POIs. Indeed, a comprehensive understanding of POI life cycle can be helpful for various tasks, such as urban planning, business site selection, and real estate evaluation. In this paper, we develop a framework, named POLIP, for characterizing the POI life cycle with multiple data sources. Specifically, to investigate the POI evolution process over time, we first formulate a serial classification problem to predict the life status of POIs. The prediction approach is designed to integrate two important perspectives: 1) the spatial-temporal dependencies associated with the prosperity of POIs, and 2) the human mobility dynamics hidden in the citywide taxicab data related to the POIs at multiple granularity levels. In addition, based on the predicted life statuses in successive time windows for a given POI, we design an algorithm to characterize its life cycle. Finally, we performed extensive experiments using large-scale and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the feasibility in automatic characterizing POI life cycle and shed important light on future research directions.},

With core techniques rooted in semantic information extraction and optimization-based sensor data fusion, ClickLoc is able to bootstrap with few images. Leveraging sensor-enriched photos, ClickLoc also enables user localization with a single photo of the surrounding place of interest (POI) with high accuracy and short delay. Incorporating multi-modal localization with Manifold Alignment and Trapezoid Representation, ClickLoc not only localizes efficiently, but also provides image-assisted navigation.

As a case study, we focus on active workstations that incorporate under desk elliptical trainers, and conduct controlled experiments regarding work performance and a four week long field deployment to explore user experience with 13 participants. We investigate how such workouts influence work performance, when and why workers work out during working hours, and the general feelings of workers regarding usage. Our experimental results indicate that while work performance is not influenced, the cognitive load of tasks critically influences workout decisions. Active workstations were alternatively used as mood enhancers, footrests, and for fidgeting, and there exist unique social and technical aspects to be addressed, such as noise issues and space constraints.

This phone sensing-based method can potentially complement surveys, thus providing a cheaper, faster, automated method for generating insights into cooperation levels of users. Based on a 10-week field study involving 54 participants, we report that: (1) multiple phone-based signals were significantly associated with participant's cooperation attitudes; and (2) combining phone-based signals yielded a predictive model with AUCROC of 0.945 that performed significantly better than a comparable demography-based model at predicting individual cooperation propensities.

During this expedition, on the 25th and 26th April 2015, two devastating earthquakes struck the region. We believe we can learn from such extreme experiences and therefore reflect on this epic adventure through a set of themes to articulate two dimensions (expected-unexpected and instrumental-experiential) in order to identify four roles for adventure-technology: as coach, rescuer, documentarian and mentor. Our work aims to provide HCI designers with an initial conceptual lens to embrace adventure, and more generally, to expand our knowledge of supporting people's physically active lifestyle.},

Such systems aim to reduce users' cognitive and physical workload, and improve well-being. While the benefits of these systems are clear, recent studies suggest that users may misconstrue their performance of tasks. We see an opportunity in designing interaction techniques that improve how users perceive the performance of such systems. We report two lab studies (N=16 each) designed to investigate whether showing physical motion, which is showing the process of a system through movement (that is intrinsic to the system's task), of an autonomous system as it completes its task, affects how users perceive its performance. To ensure our studies are ecologically valid and to motivate participants to provide thoughtful responses we adopted consensus-oriented financial incentives. Our results suggest that physical presence does yield higher performance ratings.},

 abstract = {Tracking users across websites and apps is as desirable to the marketing industry as it is unalluring to users. The central challenge lies in identifying users from the perspective of different apps/sites. While there are methods to identify users via technical settings of their phones, these are prone to countermeasures. Yet, in this paper, we show that it is possible to differentiate users via their set of used apps, their app signature. To this end, we investigate the app usage of 46726 participants from the Menthal project. Even limiting our observation to the 500 globally most frequent apps results in unique signatures for 99.67% of users. Furthermore, even under this restriction, the average minimum Hamming distance to the closest other user is 25.93. Avoiding identification would thus require a massive change in the behavior of a user. Indeed, 99.4% of all users have unique usage patterns among the top 60 globally used apps. In contrast to previous work, this paper differentiates between users based on behavior instead of technical parameters. It thus opens an entirely new discussion regarding privacy.},

Different instruction systems for the workplace provide instructions on phones, tablets, and head-mounted displays (HMDs). Recently, many systems using in-situ projection for providing assembly instructions at the workplace have been proposed and became commercially available. Although comprehensive studies comparing HMD and tablet-based systems have been presented, in-situ projection has not been scientifically compared against state-of-the-art approaches yet. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by comparing HMD instructions, tablet instructions, and baseline paper instructions to in-situ projected instructions using an abstract Lego Duplo assembly task. Our results show that assembling parts is significantly faster using in-situ projection and locating positions is significantly slower using HMDs. Further, participants make less errors and have less perceived cognitive load using in-situ instructions compared to HMD instructions.},

 abstract = {Determining when an individual is eating can be useful for tracking behavior and identifying patterns, but to create nutrition logs automatically or provide real-time feedback to people with chronic disease, we need to identify both what they are consuming and in what quantity. However, food type and amount have mainly been estimated using image data (requiring user involvement) or acoustic sensors (tested with a restricted set of foods rather than representative meals). As a result, there is not yet a highly accurate automated nutrition monitoring method that can be used with a variety of foods. We propose that multi-modal sensing (in-ear audio plus head and wrist motion) can be used to more accurately classify food type, as audio and motion features provide complementary information. Further, we propose that knowing food type is critical for estimating amount consumed in combination with sensor data. To test this we use data from people wearing audio and motion sensors, with ground truth annotated from video and continuous scale data. With data from 40 unique foods we achieve a classification accuracy of 82.7% with a combination of sensors (versus 67.8% for audio alone and 76.2% for head and wrist motion). Weight estimation error was reduced from a baseline of 127.3% to 35.4% absolute relative error. Ultimately, our estimates of food type and amount can be linked to food databases to provide automated calorie estimates from continuously-collected data.},

While previous participant selection approaches mainly focus on selecting a proper subset of users for a single MCS task, multi-task-oriented participant selection is essential and useful for the efficiency of large-scale MCS platforms. This paper proposes TaskMe, a participant selection framework for multi-task MCS environments. In particular, two typical multi-task allocation situations with bi-objective optimization goals are studied: (1) For FPMT (few participants, more tasks), each participant is required to complete multiple tasks and the optimization goal is to maximize the total number of accomplished tasks while minimizing the total movement distance. (2) For MPFT (more participants, few tasks), each participant is selected to perform one task based on pre-registered working areas in view of privacy, and the optimization objective is to minimize total incentive payments while minimizing the total traveling distance. Two optimal algorithms based on the Minimum Cost Maximum Flow theory are proposed for FPMT, and two algorithms based on the multi-objective optimization theory are proposed for MPFT. Experiments verify that the proposed algorithms outperform baselines based on a large-scale real-word dataset under different experiment settings (the number of tasks, various task distributions, etc.).},

 abstract = {Hand gesture is becoming an increasingly popular means of interacting with consumer electronic devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and laptops. In this paper, we present AudioGest, a device-free gesture recognition system that can accurately sense the hand in-air movement around user's devices. Compared to the state-of-the-art, AudioGest is superior in using only one pair of built-in speaker and microphone, without any extra hardware or infrastructure support and with no training, to achieve fine-grained hand detection. Our system is able to accurately recognize various hand gestures, estimate the hand in-air time, as well as average moving speed and waving range. We achieve this by transforming the device into an active sonar system that transmits inaudible audio signal and decodes the echoes of hand at its microphone. We address various challenges including cleaning the noisy reflected sound signal, interpreting the echo spectrogram into hand gestures, decoding the Doppler frequency shifts into the hand waving speed and range, as well as being robust to the environmental motion and signal drifting. We implement the proof-of-concept prototype in three different electronic devices and extensively evaluate the system in four real-world scenarios using 3,900 hand gestures that collected by five users for more than two weeks. Our results show that AudioGest can detect six hand gestures with an accuracy up to 96%, and by distinguishing the gesture attributions, it can provide up to 162 control commands for various applications.},

Previous solutions look at data generated by human activities, such as night time lights and phone calls, for population estimation. However, these mechanisms cannot achieve both real-time and fine-grained population estimation because the data sampling rate is low and spatial granularity chosen is improper. We address these two problems by leveraging a key insight --- people frequently use data plan on cellphones and leave mobility signatures on cellular networks. Therefore, we are able to exploit these cellular signatures for real-time population estimation. Extracting population information from cellular data records is not easy because the number of users recorded by a cellular tower is not equal to the population covered by the tower, and mobile users' behavior is spatially and temporally different, where static estimating model does not work. We exploit context-aware city segmentation and dynamic population estimation model to address these challenges. We show that the population estimation error is reduced by 22.5% on a cellular dataset that includes 1 million users.},

While technologies, especially television and personal devices are often criticized for disrupting the social aspects of mealtimes, they are widely available and commonly used nevertheless. In this paper, we explore this tension and present a novel system TableTalk, which transforms personal devices into a communal shared display on the table to enrich mealtime interactions and experience. Our field study shows that TableTalk does not undermine togetherness, but supports familial expectations and experiences by stimulating conversation, reminiscing, bonding, education, and socializing. We discuss how technology that is sensitive to the needs of family interactions can augment the commensal experience and reflect on design choices and opportunities that contribute, rather than disrupt, family mealtimes.},

 abstract = {Most location based services require semantic place names such as Staples, rather than physical coordinates. Past work has mostly focussed on achieving localization accuracy, while assuming that the translation of physical coordinates to semantic names will be done manually. This paper makes an effort to automate this step, by leveraging the presence of a website corresponding to each store and the availability of a repository of WiFi-tagged pictures from different stores. By correlating the text inside the pictures, against the text extracted from store websites, our proposed system, called AutoLabel, can automatically label clusters of pictures, and the corresponding WiFi APs, with store names. Later, when a user enters a store, her mobile device scans the WiFi APs and consults a lookup table to recognize the store she is in. Experiment results from 40 different stores show recognition accuracy upwards of 87%, even with as few as 10 pictures from a store, offering hope that automatic large-scale semantic labeling may indeed be possible from pictures and websites of stores.},

This framework provides participants with unobstructed tasks that do not break their original commuting plans, while ensuring a sensing program balanced coverage of data that better supports upper-level applications. The framework consists of three components: 1) an objective function to measure data coverage based on the entropy of data with different spatio-temporal granularities; 2) a graph-based task design algorithm to compute a near-optimal task for each participant, using a dynamic programming strategy; 3) a participant recruitment mechanism to find a portion of participants from candidates for a given budget. We evaluate our framework based on a field study and simulations, finding its advantages beyond baselines.},

Modern thermostat designs do overcome some of these limitations, but retrofitting them to existing buildings is prohibitively expensive. Software thermostats based on web or smartphone apps provide an alternate interaction mechanism with minimal deployment cost. However, their usage and effectiveness have not been studied extensively in real settings. We present Genie, a novel software thermostat that we designed and deployed in our university for over 21 months. We compare the use of Genie to traditional thermostats. Our data and user study show that due to the clarity of information and wider thermal control provided by Genie, users feel more comfortable in their offices. Furthermore, the improved comfort did not affect the overall energy consumption or lead to misuse of HVAC controls.},

These agents often exhibit human-like personality traits, such as responding in a humorous way or showing caring behavior in reminders. We are exploring this approach in the context of smart homes and home automation. Should a smart home have a proactive or passive personality? Should it try to socialize with inhabitants? What personality traits do people consider desirable or undesirable? To learn more about this design space, we created two variants of a usage scenario of a domestic routine in a smart home to demonstrate different personality trait combinations. Forty-one participants experienced the scenario and provided feedback about the designs. In this paper, we report findings about participants' preferences, how they responded to the proactive and social behavior our prototype demonstrated and implications for the design of agent-based interfaces in the home.},

The key rational of WalkieLokie is that a user can perceive a series of spatial-related acoustic signals emitted from a presenter, which depicts the relation position between the user and the presenter. The proliferation of smart devices, together with the cheap accessory (e.g., dummy speaker) embedded in daily used items (e.g., smart clothes), paves the way for WalkieLokie applications. We design a novel algorithm to estimate the position and signal processing methods to support accurate positioning. The experiment results show that the mean error of ranging and direction estimation is 0.63m and 2.46 degrees respectively. Extensive experiments conducted in noisy environments validate the robustness of WalkieLokie.},

Being readmitted is associated with significantly shorter survival, and is often preventable. Predictors of readmission are still not well understood, particularly those under the patient's control: behavioral risk factors. Our work evaluates the ability of behavioral risk factors, specifically Fitbit-assessed behavior, to predict readmission for 25 postsurgical cancer inpatients. Our results show that sum of steps, maximum sedentary bouts, frequency, and low breaks in sedentary times during waking hours are strong predictors of readmission. We built two models for predicting readmissions: Steps-only and Behavioral model that adds information about sedentary behaviors. The Behavioral model (88.3%) outperforms the Steps-only model (67.1%), illustrating the value of passively collected information about sedentary behaviors. Indeed, passive monitoring of behavior data, i.e., mobility, after major surgery creates an opportunity for early risk assessment and timely interventions.},

To profile human movement using CSI, we use signal processing techniques to generate spectrograms from CSI measurements so that the resulting spectrograms are similar to those generated by specifically designed Doppler radars. To extract features from spectrograms that best characterize the walking pattern, we perform autocorrelation on the torso reflection to remove imperfection in spectrograms. We evaluated WifiU on a dataset with 2,800 gait instances collected from 50 human subjects walking in a room with an area of 50 square meters.

Furthermore, 3) the association process itself should not cause portrait information leakage and should be accomplished in a privacy-preserving way. In this work, we design, develop, and evaluate a system, called COIN (Cloak Of INvisibility), that enables a user to flexibly express her privacy requirement and empowers the photo service provider (or image taker) to exert the privacy protection policy. Leveraging the visual distinguishability of people in the field-of-view and the dimension-order-independent property of vector similarity measurement, COIN achieves high accuracy and low overhead.

For these applications, there often exists certain homogeneity in terms of similar users and items (e.g., apps), which also correlates with various contexts like users' spatial movements and physical environments. Most existing works only focus on predicting the upcoming situation such as the next used app or next online purchase, without considering the long-term temporal co-evolution of items and contexts and the homogeneity among all dimensions. In this paper, we propose a contextual collaborative forecasting (CCF) model to address the above issues. The model integrates contextual collaborative filtering with time series analysis, and simultaneously captures various components of temporal patterns, including trend, seasonality, and stationarity. The approach models the temporal homogeneity of similar users, items, and contexts. We evaluate the model on a large real-world app usage dataset, which validates that CCF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency for long-term app usage forecasting.},

 abstract = {Spirometry is the gold standard for managing and diagnosing obstructive lung diseases. Clinical spirometers, however, are expensive and have limited portability. Vortex whistles have shown promise as a potential substitute for clinical spirometers. While vortex whistles are low-cost and are highly portable, only a subset of common spirometry measurements can be measured reliably. Moreover, no research studies have evaluated characteristics of human interaction with vortex whistles, such as maneuver learnability and mental effort. We present a modified 3D-printed vortex whistle design that enables estimation of spirometry measures not previously attainable with traditional vortex whistles. We evaluate the whistle using a pulmonary waveform generator (a commercial standard) and map parameters of the whistle construction to spirometry test endpoints. Through a human subjects trial we evaluate how to personalize whistle parameters for different subjects and assess cognitive workload while using a vortex whistle. We show that, with personalization, vortex whistles are as effective as clinical spirometers for identifying moderate airway obstruction and require similar cognitive load to use.},

We use sensors in commodity smartphones to estimate affect in the wild with no training time based on a link between affect and movement. The first experiment had 55 participants do touch interactions after exposure to positive or neutral emotion-eliciting films; negative affect resulted in faster but less precise interactions, in addition to differences in rotation and acceleration. Using off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms we report 89.1% accuracy in binary affective classification, grouping participants by their self-assessments. A follow up experiment validated findings from the first experiment; the experiment collected naturally occurring affect of 127 participants, who again did touch interactions.

This is done by exploiting not only geographic data but also crowd footprints in Social Network Services (SNS) and Location Based Social Networks (LBSN). Specifically, we detect point, area, and line landmarks by using three indicators to measure landmark's utility: visit popularity, direct visibility, and indirect visibility. We then construct an effective route graph based on the extracted landmarks, which facilitates optimal path search. In the experiments, we show that landmark-based routes out-perform the ones created by baseline from the perspectives of the lap time and the number of references necessary to check self-positions for adjusting route directions.},

In this paper, we present WiDir, the first system that leverages WiFi wireless signals to estimate a human's walking direction, in a device-free manner. Human motion changes the multipath distribution and thus WiFi Channel State Information at the receiver end. WiDir analyzes the phase change dynamics from multiple WiFi subcarriers based on Fresnel zone model and infers the walking direction. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype using commercial WiFi devices and evaluate it in both home and office environments. Experimental results show that WiDir can estimate human walking direction with a median error of less than 10 degrees.},

However, such codes suffer from two common drawbacks: poor viewing experience and inability to be identified through itself. In this work, we propose ART-code-- Adaptive Robust doT matrix barcode, which aims to preserve ART and CODE features in one visual pattern. It works on any surface (paper or electronic displays) and is able to convert any image or any form of human-readable contents (e.g., a picture, a logo, a slogan) into an ARTcode. It looks like an image which retains human-readable and aesthetically pleasant contents, and in the meanwhile, it acts as a QR code which conveys data bits over the visual channel. The core enablers in ARTcode are (1) the design of the colored dot matrix for data embedding with little distortion from the original image and (2) a comprehensive error correction scheme which enhances decoding robustness against noises and interferences from the original image in ARTcode. We implement ARTcode with the receiver on Android phones and the sender from a PC or a phone (it can be printed in paper). We conduct extensive user survey and experiments for evaluation. It validates the effectiveness and wide applicability of ARTcode: It works well with all of 197 images randomly downloaded, covering representative categories of the gray-scale images, logos, colored ones with low/medium/strong contrasts. The image quality is quite acceptable in a subjective user-perception survey with 50 participants and data communication accuracy achieves as high as 99% in almost all the cases (> 96% raw accuracy in ARTcode without error detection and other schemes).},

We identify certain limitations of the previous approaches. Instead, we propose a new data-driven framework, called DestPre, which is not based on a probabilistic model, but directly operates on the trajectories and makes the prediction. We make use of only historic trajectories, without individual identity information. Our design of DestPre, although simple, is a result of several useful observations from the real trajectory data. DestPre involves an index based on Bucket PR Quadtree and Minwise hashing, for efficiently retrieving similar trajectories, and a clustering on destinations for predictions. By incorporating some additional ideas, we show that the prediction accuracy can be further improved. We have conducted extensive experiments on real Beijing Taxi dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DestPre.},

This algorithm can remove the need to collect data of all location labels and select location labels to acquire new data efficiently.

Instrumental uses of technology are goal-directed and purposeful, while ritualistic uses are habitual and diversionary. In this paper, we provide an empirical account of the nature of instrumental vs. ritualistic use of smartphones based on data collected from 43 Android users over 2 weeks through logging application use and collecting ESM survey data about the purpose of use. We describe the phone-use behaviors users exhibit when seeking instrumental and ritualistic gratifications, and we develop a classification scheme for predicting ritualistic vs. instrumental use with an accuracy of 77% for a general model, increasing to more than 97% with a sliding confidence threshold. We discuss how such a model might be used to improve the experience of smartphone users in application areas such as recommender systems and social media.},

The technique relies only on a conventional webcam to enable users to produce matching gestures with any given body parts, even whilst holding objects.

This paper presents Sensus, a new MCS system for human-subject studies that bridges the gap between human-subject researchers and MCS methods. Sensus alleviates technical burdens with on-device, GUI-based design of sensing plans, simple and efficient distribution of sensing plans to study participants, and uniform participant experience across iOS and Android devices. Sensing plans support many hardware and software sensors, automatic deployment of sensor-triggered surveys, and double-blind assignment of participants within randomized controlled trials. Sensus offers these features to study designers without requiring knowledge of markup and programming languages. We demonstrate the feasibility of using Sensus within two human-subject studies, one in psychology and one in engineering. Feedback from non-technical users indicates that Sensus is an effective and low-burden system for MCS-based data collection and analysis.},

Our goal was to reveal gaps in current technologies that can be addressed by the UbiComp community. Using contextual inquiry, we observed 11 low vision people perform a wayfinding and shopping task in an unfamiliar environment. The task involved wayfinding and searching and purchasing a product. We found that, although there are low vision aids on the market, participants mostly used their smartphones, despite interface accessibility challenges. While smartphones helped them outdoors, participants were overwhelmed and frustrated when shopping in a store.

 abstract = {With the widespread adoption of smartphones, we have observed an increasing popularity of Location-Based Services (LBSs) in the past decade. To improve user experience, LBSs often provide personalized recommendations to users by mining their activity (i.e., check-in) data from location-based social networks. However, releasing user check-in data makes users vulnerable to inference attacks, as private data (e.g., gender) can often be inferred from the users' check-in data. In this paper, we propose PrivCheck, a customizable and continuous privacy-preserving check-in data publishing framework providing users with continuous privacy protection against inference attacks. The key idea of PrivCheck is to obfuscate user check-in data such that the privacy leakage of user-specified private data is minimized under a given data distortion budget, which ensures the utility of the obfuscated data to empower personalized LBSs. Since users often give LBS providers access to both their historical check-in data and future check-in streams, we develop two data obfuscation methods for historical and online check-in publishing, respectively. An empirical evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that our framework can efficiently provide effective and continuous protection of user-specified private data, while still preserving the utility of the obfuscated data for personalized LBSs.},

In this field, most activity recognition systems rely on supervised learning methods to extract activity models from labeled datasets. An inherent problem of that approach consists in the acquisition of comprehensive activity datasets, which is expensive and may violate individuals' privacy. The problem is particularly challenging when focusing on complex ADLs, which are characterized by large intra- and inter-personal variability of execution. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to recognize complex ADLs exploiting the semantics of activities, context data, and sensing devices. Through ontological reasoning, we derive semantic correlations among activities and sensor events. By matching observed sensor events with semantic correlations, a statistical reasoner formulates initial hypotheses about the occurred activities. Those hypotheses are refined through probabilistic reasoning, exploiting semantic constraints derived from the ontology. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets show that the accuracy of our unsupervised method is comparable to the one of state of the art supervised approaches.},

However, majority of the time this high bandwidth level is unnecessary, and the bandwidth demand can be easily met by 3G radios at a reduced power level. While 2G radios demand even lower power, they do not offer adequate bandwidth to meet the demand of interactive applications; however, the 2G radio may be utilized to provide connectivity when the phone is in the standby mode. To address different demands for bandwidth, we propose GreenTouch, a system that dynamically adapts to the bandwidth demand and system state by switching between 4G LTE, 3G, and 2G with the goal of minimizing delays and maximizing energy efficiency. GreenTouch associates users' behavior to network activity through capturing and correlating user interactions with the touch display. We have used top applications on the Google play store to show the potential of GreenTouch to reduce energy consumption of the radios by 10%, on average, compared to running the applications in the standard Android.

 abstract = {Despite prejudice cannot be directly observed, nonverbal behaviours provide profound hints on people inclinations. In this paper, we use recent sensing technologies and machine learning techniques to automatically infer the results of psychological questionnaires frequently used to assess implicit prejudice. In particular, we recorded 32 students discussing with both white and black collaborators. Then, we identified a set of features allowing automatic extraction and measured their degree of correlation with psychological scores. Results confirmed that automated analysis of nonverbal behaviour is actually possible thus paving the way for innovative clinical tools and eventually more secure societies.},

 abstract = {Bike sharing is booming globally as a green transportation mode, but the occurrence of over-demand stations that have no bikes or docks available greatly affects user experiences. Directly predicting individual over-demand stations to carry out preventive measures is difficult, since the bike usage pattern of a station is highly dynamic and context dependent. In addition, the fact that bike usage pattern is affected not only by common contextual factors (e.g., time and weather) but also by opportunistic contextual factors (e.g., social and traffic events) poses a great challenge. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic cluster-based framework for over-demand prediction. Depending on the context, we construct a weighted correlation network to model the relationship among bike stations, and dynamically group neighboring stations with similar bike usage patterns into clusters. We then adopt Monte Carlo simulation to predict the over-demand probability of each cluster. Evaluation results using real-world data from New York City and Washington, D.C. show that our framework accurately predicts over-demand clusters and outperforms the baseline methods significantly.},

 abstract = {Effectively utilizing multimodal information (e.g., heart rate and acceleration) is a promising way to achieve wearable sensor based human activity recognition (HAR). In this paper, an activity recognition approach MARCEL (<u>M</u>ultimodal <u>A</u>ctivity <u>R</u>ecognition with <u>C</u>lassifier <u>E</u>nsemble) is proposed, which exploits the diversity of base classifiers to construct a good ensemble for multimodal HAR, and the diversity measure is obtained from both labeled and unlabeled data. MARCEL uses neural network (NN) as base classifiers to construct the HAR model, and the diversity of classifier ensemble is embedded in the error function of the model. In each iteration, the error of the model is decomposed and back-propagated to base classifiers. To ensure the overall accuracy of the model, the weights of base classifiers are learnt in the classifier fusion process with sparse group lasso. Extensive experiments show that MARCEL is able to yield a competitive HAR performance, and has its superiority on exploiting multimodal signals.},

Previous studies demonstrate that the awareness of our bodily signals, such as our heart rate, directly influences the way we feel. By leveraging these findings we designed a wearable device to regulate user's anxiety by providing a false feedback of a slow heart rate. The results of an experiment with 67 participants show that the device kept the anxiety of the individuals in low levels when compared to the control group and the other conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings and present some promising directions for designing and developing this type of intervention for emotion regulation.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is a promising complementary technique to balance the requirements on both accuracy and costs in outdoor and indoor positioning systems. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively tackle the three sub problems involved in PDR, including step detection and counting, heading estimation and step length estimation, based on sequentially rotating the device (reference) frame to the Earth (reference) frame through sensor fusion. To be specific, a robust step detection and counting algorithm is devised according to vertical angular velocities and turns out to be tolerant of various smartphone placements; then, a zero velocity update (ZUPT) based algorithm is leveraged to calibrate the measurements in the Earth frame; on these grounds, the heading and step length are further estimated by exploiting the cyclic features of walking. A thorough and extensive experimental analysis is conducted and confirms the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed PDR framework as well as the corresponding algorithms.},

 abstract = {Air pollution has adverse effects on humans and ecosystem, and spatially fine-grained air quality information (i.e., the air quality information of every fine-grained area) can help people to avoid unhealthy outdoor activities. However, the number of air quality monitoring stations is usually limited, and thus spatially fine-grained air quality estimation is a challenging task. This paper proposes a method for inferring spatially fine-grained air quality information throughout a city. On one hand, since air quality is affected by multiple factors (e.g., factory waste gases and automobile exhaust fumes), this method employs various data sources, including traffic, road network, point of interests (POIs), and check-ins from social network services, which are related to air quality, to conduct the estimation. On the other hand, since the labeled data are highly limited due to the sparseness of monitoring stations, this method uses an improved ensemble semi-supervised learning (Semi-EP) to establish the relationship between the various data sources and urban air quality. Semi-EP firstly generates multiple classifiers from the original labeled data set and these classifiers are retrained in the iterative co-training process. Then, ensemble pruning technique is used to select the most-diverse subset from these multiple classifiers. This method is evaluated on the real-world dataset of Hangzhou city, China, and the experimental results have demonstrated its advantages over state-of-the-art methods.},

First, we developed a smartphone application to capture data on places, social context and nightlife activities, and to record mobile videos capturing the ambiance of places. Second, we conducted an "in-the-wild" study with more than 200 participants over a period of three months in two Swiss cities, resulting in a total of 1,394 unique place visits and 843 videos that spread across place categories (including personal homes and public parks), social and ambiance variables. Finally, we investigated the use of automatic ambiance features to estimate the loudness and brightness of places at scale, and found that while features are reliable with respect to video content, videos do not always reflect the place ambiance reported by people in-situ. We believe that the developed methodology provides an opportunity to understand the physical mobility, activities, and social context of youth as they experience different aspects of nightlife.},

 abstract = {With the increasing popularity of smartphones, battery life is among the most crucial issues for mobile users. This paper presents a crowdsensing-based use guide to extend the lifetime of smartphones. The system answers a question raised by phone usage: Why is my phone battery draining quickly compared to others phones despite running the same applications? The proposed system pinpoints the major causes of battery drain in terms of both hardware and software aspects. In relation to the hardware aspect, the system quantifies degree of battery aging as a ratio metric; an estimate of 50% indicates that the battery is at half of full capacity, meaning that battery usage time is approximately half that of a new battery. The system automatically profiles battery age based on charging duration data collected by crowdsensing. In its software aspect, the system guides phone configuration to extend application usage times. The system mines large-scale usage data to infer the major energy holes in a user's phone usage. The scheme works autonomously without user intervention and does not require any external equipment. Extensive evaluation with 3,000 users demonstrated that the proposed scheme successfully extends battery life for typical mobile users.},
