The people on the monitoring side wanted the monitoring system to allow them to monitor in detail. Conversely, it was observed for the people being monitored that the more detailed the monitoring, the greater the feelings of being surveilled intrusively. Evaluation experiments were performed using the location data of three people in different living areas. The results of the experiments show that it is possible to control the levels of monitoring and privacy protection without being affected by the shape of a living area by adjusting the quantization level of location information. Furthermore, it became clear that the granularity of location information satisfying the people on the monitored side and the monitoring side is different.},

Combining this with contextual data and subjective data (perceived fatigue for example), could generated a hearing profile for the end user. This could be used for continuous fitting based on user feedback of the hearing instruments at a later point in time. We suggest, that pre-fitting and a continuous process could create a paradigm shift empowering and transforming the user into an essential part of the solution, through increased awareness and inclusion. The end result could be a potentially better fitting, and a better hearing experience for the individual.},

In this paper, we identify a new research question in activity recognition -- discovering and learning unknown activities that have not been pre-defined or observed. As pervasive systems intend to be deployed in a real-world environment for a long period of time, it is infeasible, to expect that users will only perform a set of pre-defined activities. Users might perform the same activities in a different manner, or perform a new type of activity. Failing to detect or update the activity model to incorporate new patterns or activities will outdate the model and result in unsatisfactory service delivery. To address this question, we explore the solution space and propose an estimation-based approach to not only discover and learn new activities over time, but also benefit from no need to store any historic sensor data.},

The effectiveness of each representation was assessed for three levels of student expertise (experts, intermediates and novices) using entropy-based transition analysis of the gaze data. The results show that students of different skill level (a) prefer different representations for problem-solving, (b) switch between representations with different frequencies, and (c) can be distinguished by the density of representation use. The obtained results confirm earlier findings of physics education research quantitatively which were initially obtained by student interviews and observational studies.},

To this end, we propose MetroEye, a fine-grained passenger tracking service underground. MetroEye leverages smartphone sensors to record ambient contextual features, and infers the state of passengers (including stop, running, and interchange) during a metro trip using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model. MetroEye further provides arrival alarm services based on individual passenger state, and aggregates crowdsourced interchange durations to guide passengers for intelligent metro trip planning. Experimental results within 6 months across over 14 subway trains in 3 major cities demonstrate that MetroEye outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

We conducted a natural experiment to collect user smartphone and computer usage, heart rate and survey data in situ. By correlation and principle component analysis, a set of features could then be constructed. The performance was evaluated under leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, where the combined behavioral and physiological features enabled us to achieve 84.85% accuracy for general stress, 71.33% one kind of eustress as an urge for better performance, and 57.34% for eustress as a state of better mood.

These platforms have been tailored for iterative graph computations and can offer an order of magnitude performance gain over generic data-flow frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Spark. Nevertheless, the increasing availability of such platforms and their functionality overlap necessitates a comparative study on various aspects of the platforms, including applications, performance and energy efficiency. In this work, we focus on the energy efficiency aspect of some large scale graph processing platforms. Specifically, we select two representatives, e.g., Apache Giraph and Spark GraphX, for the comparative study. We compare and analyze the energy consumption of these two platforms with PageRank, Strongly Connected Component and Single Source Shortest Path algorithms over five different realistic graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that GraphX outperforms Giraph in terms of energy consumption. Specifically, Giraph consumes 1.71 times more energy than GraphX on average for the mentioned algorithms.},

Top-tier training is only found in few locations around the world, and comes at an exceptional price. In this context, remote education might represent an affordable alternative: it would allow skilled dance teachers to connect with a wider audience. Although prior research has begun to develop technologies for dancers, there is no consensus on the type of feedback that should be provided to allow remote ballet learning. We prototyped four variations of a technologically simulated mirror to evaluate different combinations of feedback commonly used in traditional ballet settings. Our preliminary results suggest that systems for remote ballet learning should provide combinations of visual, verbal, value, and corrective feedback.},

 abstract = {Users of self-tracking (such as tracking steps) tend to abandon the technology after a few months of using it. Previous user research suggests that users have "learned enough" and feel they no longer benefit from the technology. However, what exactly does "learned enough" entail? What, when, and how do users actually learn? This paper reports our initial efforts to investigate these questions. We (a) present a small-scale mixed-method pilot study in which we explored learning with step trackers; (b) suggest four levels of learning that Personal Informatics tools can foster: data level, routine level, correlational level, and problem-screening level; and (c) discuss how future research can use and extend this initial framework to study what and how people learn with self-tracking technology.},

According to WHO, depression is one of the prime causes of disability with 350 million people suffering from it globally. Patients with SMIs require prolonged care and management which in long term adversely affects the caregiver's health. Existing studies leverage the potential of mobile technology to build healthcare systems for mental illnesses. Most of these studies are patient centric with an aim to assist patients in self-management of their illness. The studies focused only on patients have neither exploited the potential of caregiver's role, nor have explored the solutions for managing their burden. We aim to provide a solution that leverage the role of caregivers in providing healthy cooperation between the patients and the doctors in managing SMIs. In this paper we present our work in progress --Harmony - a system designed to encourage the patients in adopting an efficient morning routine. Aim of the current prototype is to reduce the morning efforts of the caregiver by assisting the patient in becoming independent.},

Recent advances in the manufacturing of thin, bendable electronics and a novel architecture for arranging pixels permit the fabrication of a 'display material' that challenges conventional perceptions of this medium. Envisioning digital displays as a material means that their design is no longer limited to rectangular screens, but can be scaled in size; cut, folded or molded; or combined with other materials and devices to create compelling interactions. In this paper, we explore some of this potential in the context of configuring body-worn items such as clothing. As a more concrete use example, we further present and discuss some initial ideas for aesthetic, expressive and functional configurations of body casts as a specific kind of body cover.},

It aims to use lifestyle information to map out the key elements of a regular railway commute, the stressors encountered during the process, and the factors that make it a salient habit. Research will then involve the utilisation of both travel and lifestyle data to identify the points in a person's life at which these habits can be influenced -- namely, the question of whether information provision during times of lifestyle/contextual change can be effective in influencing travel habits. Furthermore, it will involve the analysis of key stressors within the travel context, and how they can be avoided through the provision of appropriate information at the right time. The objectives of this form research involve improving customer experience for the individual through personal optimisation of everyday travel, while also providing train operating companies with a more comprehensive understanding of customer issues. The project will give the academic literature a comprehensive understanding of the psychological motivations, and situational factors that influence the daily commuter; thus providing a more in-depth understanding of how the concept of digital identity can be used to understand the life of a typical railway traveller.},

This paper discusses the motivation for creating the device and how its purpose and design was influenced by focus groups and field trial feedback. The paper goes on to chart the device's development through execution of the concept and ends with conclusions and next steps.},

 abstract = {The goal of ubiquitous computing, as first envisioned by Mark Weiser and afterwards pursued and developed by Gregory D. Abowd and Elizabeth D. Mynatt among many others, is to provide the computing service the user needs in the situation, place and configuration she needs it [23, 1]. Human-Computer Interaction in ubiquitous systems should therefore be as natural as possible. This can be achieved by using interaction modes that are perceived as more natural than others, by supporting multimodal interaction and also by implementing context-awareness. One main characteristic of ubiquitous environments is the presence and usage of many different interactive devices. In Weiser's vision, those are for example tabs, pads and boards [23]. Today, smart watches, smartphones, laptops, personal computers and tablets are ubiquitous in our lives. Multi-touch displays and tables, big display walls or screens and many other interactive devices, such as smart glasses, are becoming more common, too. A challenge in ubiquitous computing is to realize the interconnection between these devices, as this is the "key to his vision", described by Ebling & Baker in their assessment of Weiser's vision 20 years after it's first publication [7]. Most of the interactive technologies used today are not out of the box compatible with each other and plug and play usage is not supported.},

In the experiment described a physically demanding construction task is completed by a team of 4 volunteers. The task, to build a large video wall, requires communication, coordination, and physical collaboration between group members. Minimal outside assistance is provided to better reflect the ad-hoc and loosely structured nature of real-world construction tasks. On-body inertial measurement units (IMU) record each subject's head and arm movements; a wearable eye-tracker records gaze and ego-centric video; and audio is recorded from each person's head and dominant arm. A first look at the data reveals promising correlations between, for example, the movement patterns of two people carrying a heavy object. Also revealed are clues on how complementary information from different sensor types, such as sound and vision, might further aid collaboration recognition.},

SkinMotion reconstructs human motions from skin-stretching movements. In this workshop, we discuss the potential applications of SkinMotion. In addition, we explore one specific instance -- finger motion detection using the skin movement on the dorsum of the hand. Results show that SkinMotion can achieve 5.84° estimate error for proximal phalanx flexion on average.

However, the possibility of ubiquitous presence of lifelogging devices especially in private spheres has raised serious concerns with respect to personal privacy. Different practitioners and active researchers in the field of lifelogging have analysed the issue of privacy in lifelogging and proposed different mitigation strategies. However, none of the existing works has considered a well-defined privacy threat model in the domain of lifelogging. Without a proper threat model, any analysis and discussion of privacy threats in lifelogging remains incomplete. In this paper we aim to fill in this gap by introducing a first-ever privacy threat model identifying several threats with respect to lifelogging. We believe that the introduced threat model will be an essential tool and will act as the basis for any further research within this domain.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the study of location prediction has received heightened attention due to its applications in LBS and other areas. However, most of the techniques and subsequent conclusions drawn from previous research works are specific to the data used in the study. For instance, resolution of location data and inclusion of external data (e.g., from social networks) may limit application of previous techniques to new situations. Therefore, we explore ways of enhancing location prediction techniques which leverage big data without the need for external data sources. To this end, we study a large CDR dataset with more than 3.5 billion calls from a leading cellular network provider in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The research question we tackle is how we can leverage big data to enhance performance of location predictors? Based on spatio-temporal analysis of call activity, we devise a scheme to compute prior probabilities from cell call activity. With this reasoning, we develop an enhanced Bayes predictor which uses a distance threshold and the users' regular location to improve generation of prior probabilities. Experimental results show that overall the enhanced Bayes predictor improves accuracy by 17 percentage points.},

Although eye-tracking technology is still in its infancy, it offers the greatest potential for novel communication solutions and applications. Whereas head-mounted eye-trackers are widely used in research, several applications require most unintrusive eye tracking, ideally realized by means of a single, low-cost camera placed away from the subject. However, such remote devices usually provide low resolution images and pose several challenges to gaze position estimation. The key challenge in such a scenario is the robust detection of the pupil center in the recorded image. We evaluated eight state-of-the-art algorithms for pupil detection on three manually labeled data sets recorded in remote tracking scenarios. Among the evaluated algorithms, ElSe [6] proved to be the best performing approach on overall 3202 images from remote eye tracking, which include changing illumination, occlusion, head movements, and off-axial camera position. In addition, we contribute a new data set with 445 annotated images, recorded in a fixed setup with a low cost camera capable of using natural and infrared light.},

A comprehensive site survey is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjects to environmental changes. In this work, we develop a mobile participatory game, MobiBee, to collect fingerprints with the help of quick response (QR) codes (posted on walls or pillars as location tags). Various incentive strategies, including monetary, entertainment and competition, are utilized. The location marker is deliberately designed to ensure that fingerprints are collected at the targeted locations in a stationary manner. Interestingly, a few instances of QR code forgery have been identified during the game play, which exposes the vulnerability of using QR code in indoor localization. A fraud detection mechanism is hence proposed. Experiments show that the proposed approach can accurately detect the QR code forgery and improve indoor localization accuracy.},

However, designing a system based on energy harvesting is much more difficult than designing battery-powered systems. The system has to weigh the balance between harvested energy and consumed energy, while taking into account various uncertainties in the actual environment. In order to achieve this requirement, it is necessary to precisely refine and integrate hardware modules and software structures; however, it is still difficult for non-experts to design such a system from scratch. In this paper, we propose PLEH, a PLanning simulation tool for Energy Harvesting applications, which will facilitate in determining the most relevant hardware modules and the software structure. PLEH estimates energy consumption varying over time based on our abstract EH application model. We show three usage scenarios that are common to novice developers of EH applications.},

 abstract = {The problem domain of my PhD thesis is divided into two parts. First, we introduce position aware systems including the well-known Location-based Services (LBS) and Proximity-based Services (PBS) as subclass of LBS. The study [33] reports that 19% of the world's mobile users already using LBS and the most popular application is the navigation via maps and GPS signal. Furthermore, one in five (22%) of LBS users enrich their social lives by finding friends in the nearby environment. For example, MobiClique [26] alerts users when other users are in physical proximity and share a relationship with them based on profile and friend list. The LBS are based upon the absolute position of an user to answer the question "where we are?". In contrast, PBS are based upon context information to find co-location with other points of interest to answer the question "who are we with?". The goal of LBS and PBS is to improve the users' daily lives by providing a personalized service to enable sharing of location information and location-aware information retrieval. Therefore, the LBS focus on a centralized architecture, the location server acts as Trusted Party (TP) which receives coordinates from the users to provide location-specific information, e.g. nearby friends. Figure 1(a) shows the common LBS architecture consisting of four major entities: mobile devices, global positioning systems, communication networks and service providers [29]. However, the assumption of a TP is questionable [36]. Besides that, most of the LBS use global positioning systems, which limits their functionality to outdoor environments, although people spend the majority of their time indoors [2].},

As participants in this workshop, we will present our initial work to create a portable and self-administered version of the Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) test. We focus on hepatic encephalopathy, but the test has potential for long-term self-monitoring in a variety of conditions impacting mental health, including cerebro-organic syndromes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, chronic fatigue, and testing of psychoactive drugs. CFF can detect transient effects on the brain and retina which serve as indicators for the above conditions. However, commercial devices for performing the CFF test are expensive and unwieldy. This limits clinical availability of CFF testing, prevents frequent self-administered testing, and reduces access. We explore the possibility of an affordable and portable device for self-administered CFF testing, implemented using commodity components paired with a mobile phone app. Such a device surfaces many future research challenges analogous to those in other areas of mental health. As background for discussions in this workshop, we discuss our initial exploratory design efforts and potential future steps for the project.},

Its potential meets the lack in resources and capacity of health care systems to provide DHI for the treatment of noncommunicable diseases. In the current work, we introduce the first personalization approach for MobileCoach with the purpose of identifying the needs of participants, tailoring the treatment and, as a consequence, enhancing the capability of MobileCoach-based DHIs. The personalization approach is then exemplified by a very first prototype of a DHI for people with asthma that is able to detect coughing by just using a smartphone's microphone. First empirical results with five healthy subjects and 80 coughs indicate its technical feasibility as the detection accuracy yielded 83.3%. Future work will focus on the integration of personalized sensing and supporting applications for MobileCoach.},

With the rise of personal GPS devices, numerous navigation apps now exist that are tailored to the specific needs of outdoor enthusiasts. Nevertheless, they all have the common problem, that they require the users to "store" the mobile device in their pockets to have the "hands free" for interaction. While wearable devices such as smartwatches overcome this problem, they have the disadvantage that they often offer very small screen space.

However, what currently is not known is how regular the movements leading from one location to another are, i.e., how regular is the route mobility of individuals. The present paper contributes by conducting the first ever empirical study on regularity of route regularity. We demonstrate that routes indeed contain a high degree of regularity and that the uncertainty associated with a route is concentrated along a small set of so-called fork points. Accordingly, our results suggest that routes can be encoded using a combination of sub-segments with high regularity, and a set of fork points that serve as transition points for the sub-segments. We carry out our analysis using the CabSpotting dataset, which contains mobility traces from 538 cabs in San Francisco metropolitan area collected during one month period.},

The results are weighted (thereby considering the visual acuity in each visual field) to determine the total visibility of the object. As a proof of concept, we exemplify the proposed model in a virtual reality application which incorporates a head-mounted display with integrated eye tracking functionality. In this context, we implement several proactive system behaviors including contextual information presentation with an adaptive level of detail and attention guidance; the latter is implemented by detecting visual acuity limitations or attention drifts.},

A first step in that direction is to identify detectable contexts in which interruptibility is very high or low. In this paper, we present results of a survey taken by 68 persons. Within the survey, we assess how much smartphone notifications interrupt and disturb users at a specific location. The locations were selected based on the places that can be recognized by the Google Places API. This shall serve as a basis for future interruptibility research.

As you know, many things wearing on your body have already become a sensor to understand our activities. Most famous things are watches and glasses. In the future, we suppose that unwearable things, such as cutlery, sport gear and instruments, would be also a sensor for recognizing our activities. Compared with our movements, the movement of unwearable things will have more variation. Also, suitable sensor and proper algorithm would be different according to the things. To enhance the senserization of various things, we have proposed a platform, called SenStick, that consists of ultra tiny all-in-one sensor board and sophisticated mobile app. If using it, every researcher can try embedding various sensor into various things and can focus on data analysis. We explain the possibility of smart experiment platform with introducing various sensorized things on the platform.},

The work described investigates the creation of garments for day-to-day use, which is a use-case probably never considered when developing off-the-shelf electronic components. In developing a new tartan pattern and fabrication technique, the authors respond to the lack of purpose-made electronic components by choosing to evolve tradition into technology. Manufacturing techniques and components for the proposed textile have been carefully considered, researched, and contrasted to previous work by the authors, as well as recent trends in the field of wearable technology. The garment is a component of a tartan pattern generating system which searches the space of all registered tartans in order to find relevant, but yet unregistered tartan color and thread count combinations from a variety of inputs either embedded on the dress, or from a mobile phone.},

In this paper, we present an experiment to investigate the effect of regular reviewing of egocentric lifelogging photos on the formation and retrieval of autobiographic memories.

We propose a method to evaluate the reader's English skill based on a mobile eye tracking system. The eye tracker captures the reader's behavior while reading a document. The front camera of the eye tracker records the scene image that contains the read document. By using a retrieval algorithm we can recognize the read document and project the eye gaze data from the scene image to the document space. Then, some features related to the reading and solving behavior on several documents are computed. As a first result, we show that the TOEIC score can be estimated with an error of 36.3 points.},

Similar to the previous studies, by assuming that body movements are indicative of speech, we show experimentally that transductive transfer learning can better model individual differences in speaking behaviour compared to a traditional person independent setup. Such behaviour is very challenging to model as people's body movements during speech vary greatly. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a transfer learning approach has been considered in the context of speaking status detection using a single body worn accelerometer. We show that by transferring knowledge across subjects, competitive performance scores compared to a person dependent training can be obtained.},

However, the significant heterogeneity in the emerging IoT devices has led to fragmented smart-home systems in which each single appliance vendor provides proprietary solution for appliance specific connectivity and user experience. One of the desired solutions in smart-home systems is to have a unified smartphone app that can control any arbitrary IoT appliances.

In particular, we present SPOT app, a smartphone-based platform for multi-vendor smart-home appliances, that features an adaptive and device-agnostic user interface enabled by a novel device driver mechanism. To validate the flexibility and feasibility of our design, we have built a SPOT prototype based on 8 real IoT devices and present the quality of generating such adaptive graphical user interface by the measure of screen smoothness in the prototyped android app.},

Our study shows that participants' interpretations of feedback about their stress level were biased by their expectations of what the graph 'should' show. Nevertheless, participants were susceptible to value interpretations of their data suggested by the visualization. This latter finding may be problematic if the standardized interpretation suggested by such a system is not accurate for the individual user in question.

We are interested in medical conditions that can be monitored using the sensors on wearable devices like the Apple Watch. We are interested in the insights that can be provided by the monitoring of a person's heart rate. We have conducted interviews with doctors to understand what can be learned about the health of an individual via their heart rate and how we can use that information to design applications that aid in monitoring these conditions. In this paper, we explore this design space and identify the applications we will develop to help users track these conditions in considerably less invasive ways than current methods.},

 abstract = {In today's fast paced environment, society is confronted with information overload, stress, and health issues. These are generally caused by accelerating technological evolution, increasing time pressure, and physical inactivity. So-called anticipatory systems, which guide users or intervene in their daily life, are seen as a very promising solution to overcome these issues. This workshop aims to share experiences of current researches on anticipatory systems in order to understand the extent of how such systems could be a solution and how they could provide personal guidance given the discovered traits of human behavior. We invite the submission of papers in the emerging research field of anticipatory mobile computing that focus on understanding, design, and development of such systems. We also welcome contributions that investigate underlying prediction models or give an insight into human behavior. The expected workshop outcome is a summary of recent challenges of anticipatory applications and interventions.},

We developed a scanner system to sense BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tag for 2.4 GHz RSSI compensation. We deployed 40 BLE scanners and over 100 BLE tags, and collected data for 100 participants at an actual event over a period of four days. Using the collected data, we estimated crowd density level that can be applied to the proposed compensation scheme based on theoretical methods on propagation loss.

We animate the upper body of the 3D model with the data from 5 inertial measurement sensors obtained from the OPPORTUNITY dataset. The animated model is shown to 6 people in a suite of experiments in order to understand to which extent it can be used for labelling. We present 3 experiments where we investigate the use of a 3D model for i) activity segmentation, ii) for "open-ended" annotation where users freely describe the activity they see on screen, and iii) traditional annotation, where users pick one activity among a pre-defined list of activities.

 abstract = {The commercial introduction of connected lighting that can be integrated with sensors and other devices is opening up new possibilities for creating responsive and intelligent environments. However, the current approach for controlling such systems is to simply replace the light switch with a somewhat more sophisticated smartphone-based remote control. In this position paper we present a study of a new connected lighting control interface -- tap sensors. The tap sensor is a wireless device equipped with an accelerometer sensor that can detect a tap interaction and send a signal to the connected lighting system, for controlling light or other outputs. The tap sensors are small enough to be discretely attached to objects, such as a table, a picture frame, or a door, and it will then turn that object into an interactive control device. Therefore, by tapping on the object, the tap sensor that is attached to it will detect the tap input and an output can subsequently be triggered. These sensors were given to participants who lived with them in their own homes for a few weeks. The results of the study showed a great appreciation for this type of interaction from both practical and hedonic perspectives. Participants informed us that the tap sensors were effective, helpful, fun and playful ways of controlling their light.},

 abstract = {Depression is a prevalent and debilitating disorder among college students. Advances in mobile technology afford the opportunity to collect heterogeneous data while people are in their natural settings. The aim of the current paper is to propose an integrated framework, DEMONS (DEpression MONitoring Study), for combining passive and active data sources using a wearable sensor and a smartphone application. The ability to combine passive and active longitudinal data with mobile devices allows for better understanding of the temporal relations between self-reported affect and physiological variables (e.g., heart rate variability) linked to depressive symptoms. Adoption of the proposed framework will provide crucial information regarding the development and maintenance of depression in college students, as well as increased opportunities for early detection and intervention.},

Questions that we addressed include the mapping from the number of detected devices to the number of people, the ability to generalize the calibration from a small number of ground truth points recorded on one day to other days and the ability to localize individuals in different conditions.

 abstract = {This paper describes the hardware acceleration of various feature calculation functions used in activity recognition. In this work we have used a large scale sensing matrix which recognizes and counts gym exercises. Human activity is played on pressure matrix and the sensor data is sent to computer using a wired protocol for further processing. The recorded data from matrix is huge making it impractical to process on a smart phone. We propose a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based processing methodology which not only accelerates sensing data processing but also reduces the size of 2D sensor data matrix to 10 features. The resultant feature set can be transferred using wireless medium to a smart phone or other processing unit where the classification can be done. Our system takes a matrix of arbitrary size and output a 'features' set for each matrix frame. We used HLS (High Level Synthesis), an approach to write algorithm for FPGA using SystemC/C/C++ instead of traditional VHDL/Verilog. Results show promising improvement in processing time as compared to Matlab. Since the size of data is reduced, wireless medium can be use to transmit data. Additionally, the development time for FPGA designs is greatly reduced due to the usage of an abstracted high level synthesis approach. This system is currently developed for pressure sensing system but this strategy can be applied to other sensing application like temperature sensor grid.},

However, these products are often little more than voice interfaces to device control apps. More focus is needed on supporting the high-level applications and goals that end users express in natural language. In this preliminary work, we collect and analyze over 1,600 utterances from nontechnical end users encompassing a variety of smart home interactions. We find that given the right context, end users voluntarily use computational language in response to open-ended prompts. From these commands and queries, we extract the computational structures and the entities, actions, and conditions that end users employ when interacting with the home. Our preliminary results suggest a path forward for end-to-end architectures that automatically map natural language utterances to executable smart home programs. We hope to help bring natural language interfaces for the home into alignment with end users' mental models.},

 abstract = {Current motion sensors in wearable devices are primarily used for simple orientation and motion sensing. They provide however signals related to more complex and subtle human behaviours which will enable next-generation human-oriented computing in scenarios of high societal value. This requires large scale human activity corpuses and improved methods to recognise activities and their context. This workshop deals with the challenges of designing reproducible experimental setups, running large-scale dataset collection campaigns, designing robust activity and context recognition methods and evaluating systems in the real world. As a special topic, we wish to reflect on the challenges and approaches to recognise activities outside of a pre-defined set to achieve an open-ended activity and context awareness. Following the success of previous years, this workshop is the place to share experiences on human activity corpus and their applications and to discuss the future of activity sensing, in particular towards open-ended contextual intelligence.},

However, the relationship between the individual heart rate and the exercise intensity is subject to stronger fluctuations and is influenced by other external and internal factors. Using solely a HRM to control the exercise intensity may lead to dangerous misinterpretations, in which other important physiological conditions are ignored and self-awareness is eliminated. In this work, we propose an interface to asses and track the rated perceived exertion (RPE), that periodically motivates the athlete to listen more carefully to his subjective feeling and creates awareness of the body. Even though results may be vague in the beginning, we think that the proposed method is preferable for hobbyists over HRMs if used over longterm.},

Tojikomori is caused not only by physical factors but also by social and psychological ones. Once an elderly person becomes tojikomori, it takes a lot of time and energy to recover. It is important to take primary preventive measures, especially for currently active older adults because a little help has a great benefit. A previous study identified two key factors of tojikomori in an urban area: no exercise habits and no participation in community activities. Therefore, we developed a walking game to enhance physically healthy behavior and motivate the elderly to explore a city and lead to the discovery of favorite spots they want to visit again. In addition, we designed a group-walking program utilizing the walking game aimed for face-to-face communication with other community-dwelling elderly people. Our results show that our approach was well received, enjoyable, and effective for older adults in a real-world situation.},

When the user is satisfied, implicit feedback is given by not intervening the system. Otherwise explicit feedback such as "too bright" or "too dark" will be given. Each user feedback is modeled as a probabilistic event, which means that it is possible that sometimes the user will give different feedback for the same light level.

However, it is unclear if the available set of tracking parameters (such as an average speed, or calories burnt during a sports activity) is expressive enough when it comes to sharing in different sports. In our ongoing meta-study across three outdoor mountain sports, we have investigated whether those tracking apps meet the actual sharing requirements of amateur skiers, climbers, and trail runners.

 abstract = {As the number of people going to public facilities such as stations and airports visitors increases, the facilities become increasingly congested. To maintain personal safety and comfortableness, we have developed a dynamic guide signs system we call "Projection Sign" to control pedestrian flow. It enables signs and their information to be changed on a situational basis. This paper reports how we tested the system at Haneda Airport to examine its effectiveness. We found that users' age and the language they use affect the signs' visual attractiveness. We also found that the signs' information changes user flow trends. We use these results to discuss ways to make guide signs in public spaces more effective.},

We have devised the "Aesthetic, Expressive, and Functional Tattoos" concept from a design that reflects traditional African cultural backgrounds. The tattoo is designed to integrate with the health service system, providing human-readable child vaccination record information to family and health workers. Tattoos have formed part of tribal culture in Africa for thousands of years. Our design builds on this culture with a new ritual for recording vaccination records in Tattoo form. Our design consists of two artifacts: Firstly, a design for a tattoo which can encode basic child vaccination records. Secondly, a guide book which assists with interpreting the tattoo. Further work could include integrating machine-readable data into the tattoo system.},

Implicit Positioning adapts to its user by automatically finding, learning, and recognizing patterns in data from a smartphone's compass sensor. These patterns model characteristics of the areas the person walked through, such as the direction the person headed, and can be understood as Implicit Positions. Implicit Positioning neither relies on user feedback nor on additional infrastructure, digital maps or war-driving. All the person needs to do is carry a smartphone. To evaluate our approach, we collected data from smartphones carried by a test person in different positions. The test person covered a distance of 17.4 km in two different buildings. When taking a path for the second time, patterns were already being correctly recognized with an accuracy of up to 87.8%.},

In this paper, we propose a F>used fEature Gaussian prOcess Rgression (FEGOR) model, which employs three features from online social networks: mobility influence, content similarity, and social relationship to estimate the distance between user and social event, based on which, we could accomplish the problem of identifying the on-site users.

However, these systems do not consider the situation that gestures are performed continuously from/to other gestures or untrained movements and can not recognize such gestures accurately. This paper proposes a method that recognizes gestures performed continuously without explicit intervals. The proposed method detects segments similar to template data of target gestures and chooses the most likely segment. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experiment is conducted with five subjects. The subjects conducted three types of gestures drawing a graphic symbol in the air; circle, triangle, and cross in five kinds of situations, and ten types of gestures drawing a numeric character in the air; zero to nine. The average F-measure of graphic symbol achieved 0.78 and the average F-measure of numerical character achieved 0.79.},

 abstract = {With the deployment of modern infrastructures for public transit, several studies have analyzed the transition patterns of people by using smart card data and have characterized the areas. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method to obtain a vector representation of a geospatial area using transition patterns of people from the large-scale data of their smart cards. We extend a network embedding by taking into account geographical constraints on people transitioning in the real world. We conducted an experiment using smart card data in a large network of railroads in Kansai areas in Japan. We obtained a vector representation of each railroad station using the proposed embedding method. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing network embedding methods in the task of multi-label classification for purposes of going to a railroad station. Our proposed method can contribute to predicting people flow by discovering underlying representations of geospatial areas from mobility data.},

However, it is not always possible to sense human respiration when a subject is in different locations or faces different orientations. In this demo, we will show how a centimeter-scale position change affects the respiration detection performance. Counter-intuitively, when a subject is moving closer to the LoS, the performance of respiration sensing is not always getting better. In fact, the detectable and undetectable regions are determined by the Fresnel zone model based theory developed in [7].},

 abstract = {Many recent work has focused on graph algorithms via parallelization including PowerGraph [9] and Ligra [14]. The frameworks process large graphs in shared memory, requiring a terabyte of memory and expensive maintenance cost. Reducing graph size to fit in memory thus is crucial in cutting the cost of large-scale graph computation. Compression has been widely used to reduce graph size. However, it could meanwhile compromise graph computation efficiency caused by nontrivial decompression overhead before graph computation. In this paper, we propose a simple and yet efficient coding scheme. It not only leads to smaller size of compressed graphs; meanwhile we can perform graph computation directly on the compressed graphs with no or partial decompression, namely compression-aware computation, leading to faster running time. Our experiments validate that the coding scheme achieves 2.99X compression ratio, and three compression-aware graph algorithms achieve 7.02X, 2.88X and 2.34X faster running time than the graph algorithms on the graphs without compression.},

This is particularly difficult when two or more actors need to perform a dialogue cold. The need to hold a paper script in hand hinders the actor's ability to move freely. It also introduces a visual distraction between actors trying to engage with one another in a scene. This preliminary study uses Google Glass displayed cue cards as an alternative to traditional scripts, and compares the two approaches through a series of two-person, cold-read performances. Each performance was judged by a panel of theatre experts. The study finds that Glass has the potential to aid performance by freeing actors to better engage with one another. However, it also found that by limiting the display to one line of script at a time, the Glass application used here makes it difficult for some actors to grasp the text. In a further study, when asked to later perform the text from memory, actors who had used Glass recalled only slightly fewer lines than when they had learned using paper.},

Recently, many researchers have worked on event summarization from this kind of data. However, those works fail to present the dynamic evolution of the event and characterize the rich correlations among posts. To this end, we propose a multi-layered model for social event characterization. Based on this model, an evolutionary and multi-clue-based approach is adopted for fine-grained event summary, and a progressively multi-layer fusion approach is utilized to generate the storyline to summarize the event. Experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.},

To date mostly electrically or mechanically measurable data like heart or breathing rate are obtained --. The acquisition of biochemical, most likely in vivo, data is as interesting as the prior mentioned data, but far more difficult to obtain due to the fact that most of these data acquire invasive methods. Here we present a wearable, screen printed ion-selective sensor for monitoring and analysis of biomarkers in sweat. We show how the setup based on potentiometric evaluation of ion concentrations can be integrated with wearables and present an use case, where ions like ammonia or complementary electrolytes can provide insight into intra-corporal physiological processes and help to control training intensity in sports.},

The sensor uses 8 photodiodes to measure the reflected light in the active mode (using embedded LEDs) or it measures shadows caused by fingers in the passive mode. Several algorithms were implemented: automatic mode switching, adaptive illumination level compensation, resolution improvements using model to data fitting, etc. The embedded processor delivers recognized static or dynamic gesture codes, location of fingers, etc. Thanks to the sparse construction of the sensor and number of the detectors, it handles a few discrete but also continuous gestures. The most important features of the sensor are: low power and computational requirements in comparison to vision based gesture recognition systems and that it is a septic safe interface. It was embedded into smart glasses platform.},

Our system is comprised of a head-mounted eye-camera (capturing corneal reflections) connected to a wearable computer, to record humans' daily activities. We conducted a live logging experiment, where we collected data in uninstrumented environments.

Because traditional activity recognition utilizes supervised machine learning, unknown activity classes which do not appear in the training dataset is unable to be estimated. For this problem, zero-shot machine learning method is proposed, but it requires the preparation of semantic codes. As semantic codes, we utilize word vectors constructed from semantic word vectors and Twitter timestamps. To evaluate the proposed method, we evaluated whether we could estimate unknown activity classes, with the sensor data set collected from 20 households for 4 months, along with the user-generated labels using the web system which can estimate, modify, and add new activity types. As a result, the proposed method could even estimate unknown activity classes. Moreover, by utilizing Twitter timestamps and semantic word vectors from the Japanese Wikipedia in word vectors, the method could estimate 9 unknown activity classes.},

Unlike conventional RGB and gray scale eye tracking a seven-channel spectral video capture over the wavelength range of 380-1000 nm, in addition with spectral still images in the range of 450-950 nm, provided a detailed acquisition of spectral signatures of the eye and its surroundings.

 abstract = {Traditionally, mood is assessed by either considering physiological data or smartphones-based self-reports. Physiological data is objective and continuous, but difficult to be collected in-field and lacks a subjective component. Smartphones provide subjective feedback and objective data, but lack physiological data. We propose to combine smartphones as a rich sensor system and smartwatches as a wearable heart rate monitor. Both serve as a platform for reporting mood states. Within an explorative user study with six subjects over four weeks, we collected smartphone data and heart rate in addition to subjective ground truth via self-reports. We assessed all three mood dimensions valence, energetic arousal and calmness, but only consider valence in the context of this paper. Analyzing the information gain, we identified the relevance of temporal features (daytime, weekday, type of day) as well as the heart rate. Decision tree classifiers trained on the first three weeks and tested on the fourth achieve recognition accuracies of up to 0.91.},

 abstract = {Recently, smartphones with built-in sensors are exploited to detect human activities. Since sensing human activities may exhaust energy of a smartphone, this work brings up the concept of "activity sense organs" to the uprising smartphone sensing paradigm. As the human sense organs are the most important sensors to perceive real-world information, this work identifies the most important sensors to perceive a particular human activity based on the "quality of the features" contributed by sensors. To optimize the energy usage of activity sensing, we exploit the importance of sensors to profile the duty-cycles of sensors for activity detection. Specifically, a smartphone will operate in a duty-cycled sensing mode, where sensors in the activity sense organs will collect data at the higher sampling rate than those sensors not in the activity sense organs. We design a knowledge lifecycle to find out the activity sense organs, profile the sensing modes of activity detection, and adjust the sensing mode for real-time activity detection. The experimental results indicate that the activity sense organs provide sufficient information for activity detection.},

 abstract = {Stride parameters represent basic and useful information on track and field sprint performance. Contact mats or opto-electronic systems allow precise and unobtrusive measurements of those parameters, but their use is limited in space. Hence, there is a lack of research regarding the changes of temporal parameters throughout the competition distance (especially for long sprint), e.g. as a result of fatigue. Wearables, respectively inertial measurement units (IMUs), are not bound to limitations in space and therefore offer challenging opportunities for in-field diagnosis. This paper presents a wearable device for detecting and monitoring stance durations and step frequencies during sprinting. An application in (repetitive) long sprints is presented that analyzes changes of the temporal structure of performance parameters as a result of fatigue and level of expertise. Results indicate that the device provides reliable and accurate measurements of temporal parameters during sprinting and offers a deeper insight to movement characteristics of long sprint.},

Current research has shown that walking to a rhythm can lead to significant improvements in various aspects of gait. Our primary aim is to provide a suitable, technology based intervention to enhance gait rehabilitation of people with chronic and degenerative neurological health conditions (such as stroke). This intervention will be in the form of small, lightweight, wireless, wearable devices the user can take out of the clinic, extending their rehabilitation to their own home setting. The devices can deliver a series of vibrations at a steady rhythm giving the patient a more stable and symmetric pace of walking. The simplest version of this approach typically comprise of a very small network of just two nodes and a central controller. The existing prototypes (called the Haptic Bracelets) capture and analyse motion data in real time to provide adaptive haptic (through vibrations) cueing. In the future and after more refinement, the system could allow a single therapist to monitor and advise groups of stroke survivors undergoing therapy sessions.},

From this viewpoint, we propose a new method to estimate beautiful gait by utilizing machine learning classifiers with only one accelerometer on the body (chest, waist, or wrist). We conducted an experiment to verify the accuracy of our method with 41 subjects. Each subject wore accelerometers and walked on a straight path whose length was about 10 m 6 times. The accuracy of estimation in total 246 trials was calculated by two kinds of cross validation; leave-one-out cross validation and 41-fold cross validation. The former accuracy is 80.1% (chest), 82.1% (waist), and 82.9% (wrist). The latter accuracy is 73.2% (chest), 78.0% (waist), and 58.1% (wrist).

Here we show how a low cost single chip version of EPS can be integrated into a wearable device such as smart watch to provide relevant information about habitual movements specifically, hair touching and scratching as well as leg movement. This new modality could be used in consumer care product research such as studying the quality of shampoos and to study restless leg syndrome remotely without the need of wearing additional sensors. In both scenarios, a single sensor was worn on the wrist, similar to a smart watch, with the sensing electrode pointing away from the body (i.e. no skin contact).},

Today's most ubiquitous personal sensing devices, such as smartphones, are equipped with an array of sensors that may be used to infer different aspects of human behavior. However, inferring task engagement using smartphone sensors remains unexplored. In this paper we present our initial work on automated task engagement inference using only smartphone sensors. We design, develop and deploy a mobile sensing application TaskyApp, and collect 216 data points of sensor readings and task engagement labels from eight users in an office setting. Using machine learning we demonstrate that with up to 67.6% accuracy, relying mostly on the movement sensors, we can correctly infer a user's task engagement.},

While a lot of work has demonstrated the great potential of D2D communication, it is still unclear whether the benefits of the D2D approach can really be leveraged in practice. In this paper, we develop a software sensor, namely Detector, which senses the infrastructure in proximity of a mobile user. We analyze and evaluate D2D on the wild, i.e., not in simulations. We found that in a realistic environment, a mobile is always co-located in proximity to at least one other mobile device throughout the day. This suggests that a device can schedule tasks processing in coordination with other devices, potentially more powerful, instead of handling the processing of the tasks by itself.},

The aim of the whole experience is twofold: first, inspiring participants in designing novel concepts for multisensory interfaces; second, providing a preliminary study on the effect of these exercises in fostering creativity and supporting the design process of multisensory interfaces.},

The prevalence and severity of these issues among college students also appear to increase over time. However, most of these issues often remain undiagnosed, and as a result, untreated. One of the main reasons of this gap between illness and treatment results from the lack of reliable data over time. While health care services in college campuses have been focusing on detection of illness onset and appropriate interventions, their tools are mostly manual surveys which often fail to capture the granular details of contexts and behaviors which might provide important cues about illness onset. To overcome the limitations of these manual tools, we deployed a smartphone based tool or unobtrusive and continuous data collection from 22 students during an academic semester. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from our study about assessing mental health on college campuses using passively sensed smartphone data.},

It creates multi-sensorial encounters as a result of material affinities between sonic and tangible form. By inviting playful participation through familiar actions, participants learn to 'play the piece' and enjoy discovering and revealing sounds. The design and structure of the embroidered fabric surface encourages interaction with digitally embroidered discs that use colour, pattern and texture to distinguish them. The computational elements are approached as another material, crafted into the design of the piece during the making process. The evocative nature of sound results in a heightened emotional, resonant quality. Combining human voice with the tangible qualities of the fabric contributes to a compelling experience through touch, sound and textile.},

Today's smart home and office environments with their increasingly connected devices provide rich opportunities to deliver notifications in a context-sensitive and multi-modal way into the direct surroundings of a user eliminating the need to fish up the smartphone from the pocket. Due to the missing tool support these opportunities have however neither been sufficiently investigated nor picked up for use in daily lives. With this work we introduce an infrastructure for homes and offices that enables designers and web-developers to design and deploy context sensitive notification strategies using arbitrary connected things and smart home products such as TVs, tablets, projections, lamps, speakers and many more. We introduce the opportunities offered by this platform to go beyond simple Event-Condition-Rules and describe how the system can be used to carry out remotely controlled "in the wild" experiments.},

Rather than using sensors independently, combining their sensing capabilities facilitates more interesting and complex applications to emerge (e.g., user activity recognition). But differences between sensors ranging from sampling rate to data generation model (event triggered or continuous sampling) make integration of sensor streams challenging. Here we investigate the opportunity to use deep learning to perform this integration of sensor data from multiple sensors. The intuition is that neural networks can identify nonintuitive features largely from cross-sensor correlations which can result in a more accurate estimation. Initial results with a variant of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), show better performance with this new approach compared to classic solutions.},

Both exposures to CO (carbon monoxide) and physiological data, such as ECG (electrocardiogram), HR (Heart Rate) and body temperature, were monitored during firefighters' activities in experimental forest fire. From the QRS complex of ECG the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) was estimated and convoluted with pollutants concentration to estimate individual smoke inhalation. The analysis of smoke inhalations allowed to detect extensive exposures and to identify critical situations namely risk of faint due to smoke intoxication. Our results support the usefulness of continuous monitoring of both physiological and environmental information to prevent and detect hazardous situations while firefighters are in operational scenario like forest fires.

As a user moves through a room to locate a target item, our system shows relative distances to the target item and images of items on the way to the target. At the same time, the system scans RFID tags nearby and captures images for scanned RFID-tagged objects. This information is accumulated in a database and is accessible for future item location activities. Since all information was gathered during users' searching activities, the proposed system does not require users' effort for managing and registering tags. We asked 10 users to compare our method with the conventional method, which shows RSSI of the target item, of searching for the target item. The results suggest that our method is effective for location target RFID-tagged items.},

In Virtual Reality, an infrared (IR) camera is used for hand tracking, and direct manipulation can be accomplished by using hands. Additionally, wearable devices have also attracted attention because of their portability. We have developed a method based on the use of a wearable device to estimate the joint angle, which can be determined using the amplitude of vibration. However, the joint angle, which can be estimated, is limited to particular joints. Therefore, our proposed method determines the hand pose based on active bone-conducted sound sensing toward intuitive user interfaces. We employed the power spectral density as a feature, thereby enabling the hand pose to be classified with a support vector machine. We confirmed the recognition accuracy and the feasibility of our proposed method through evaluation experiments.},

Traditional non-intrusive activity recognition approaches are dependent on the use of various machine learning techniques to infer activities given the collected object usage data. Current activity recognition approaches are also based on knowledge driven techniques that require extensive modelling of the activities that needs to be inferred. These models can be seen as too restrictive, prescriptive and static as they are based on a finite set of activities. In this paper, we propose a novel "top down" approach to recognising activities based on object usage data, which detects patterns associated with the activity-object relationship and utilizes web knowledge in order to build dynamic activity models based on the objects used to perform the activity. Experimental results using the Kasteren dataset shows it is comparable to existing approaches.},

 abstract = {Recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs) performed in smart homes proved to be very effective when the interaction of the inhabitant with household items is considered. Analyzing how objects are manipulated can be particularly useful, in combination with other sensor data, to detect anomalies in performing ADLs, and hence to support early diagnosis of cognitive impairments for elderly people. Recent improvements in sensing technologies can overcome several limitations of the existing techniques to detect object manipulations, often based on RFID, wearable sensors and/or computer vision methods. In this work we propose an unobtrusive solution which shifts all the monitoring burden at the objects side. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of using tiny BLE beacons equipped with accelerometer and temperature sensors attached to everyday objects. We adopt statistical methods to analyze in realtime the accelerometer data coming from the objects, with the purpose of detecting specific manipulations performed by seniors in their homes. We describe our technique and we present the preliminary results obtained by evaluating the method on a real dataset. The results indicate the potential utility of the method in enriching ADLs and abnormal behaviors recognition systems, by providing detailed information about object manipulations.},

Crowdsourcing results show that aggregated expert group mode percentage error was +2.60% (SD 3.87) in predicting calories in meals and non-expert group mode percentage error was +29.07% (SD 20.48).

By utilizing Apple's iBeacon™ implementation of Bluetooth Smart, we are able to detect the proximity of users carrying a smartphone in their pocket.

However, from a psychological perspective, not all of these breakpoints represent opportune moments for interruptions. In this paper, we propose a new concept in the field of interruptibility. The concept is based on role theory and psychological interruption research. In particular, we argue that social roles which define sets of norms, expectations, rules and behaviours can provide useful information about the user's current context that can be used to enhance interruption management systems.

Most importantly, by using global positioning system data and time stamps, the system simultaneously displays a variety of log information in a time-synchronous manner. This function empowers users with not only an easy interpretation of other users' experiences but also nonverbal notifications. Shared information on this system includes photographs taken by users, Google street views, shops and restaurants on the map, daily weather, and other items relevant to users' interests. In evaluation experiments, users preferred the proposed system to conventional photograph albums and maps for explaining and sharing their experiences. Moreover, through displayed information, the listeners found out their interest items that had not been mentioned by the speakers.},

In this paper, we present BikeNow, an application that supports cyclists during their ride to minimize the stopping time at red traffic lights. BikeNow predicts the next green light phases of traffic lights along the track of cyclists and provides a suggestion to keep or change the current speed. The purpose of BikeNow is to motivate cyclists to allow the submission of ride related data like current time, position and speed that is of high value for traffic evaluation, prediction and future planing of cycle paths. The evaluation is based on a preliminary survey with 79 participants to study the target user group and a user study with 14 participants to assess the usability of the application. In addition we analyze the value of collectible data for urban traffic analysis and cycle path network planning.},

To overcome the uncertainties and risks associated with a purely best-effort, opportunistic model of such crowd-sourcing, we advocate a more centrally-coordinated approach, that (a) takes into account the predicted movement paths of workers and (b) factors in typical human behavioral responses to various incentives and deadlines. To experimentally tackle these challenges, we design, develop and experiment with a real-world mobile crowd-tasking platform on an urban campus in Singapore.

Objects that provide functional utility to their user, also indicate the type of activity that their user is doing. For example, the use of a hair dryer indicates that its user is grooming their hair. In this paper, we discuss an approach to sense the objects that the person interacts with, using only a single wearable device on the wrist of the person. Wearable devices typically have an IMU sensor, which can sense several aspects of the person's hand gestures, such as acceleration, and orientation. We collect a dataset of 17 different object interaction gestures using 5 participants in a test home. We evaluate the object gestures using supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. Our study reveals that we can recognize object interactions with 83-91% accuracy in the supervised approach, and 58-66% accuracy in the unsupervised approach.},

We present the design and detailed evaluation of a mobile gaze tracking system that can be generally applied in pervasive and ubiquitous applications that rely on free-space interactions. Using automated image processing, we also present a fast method for evaluating the achieved accuracies of the eye tracking device and the marker-based mapping onto a screen placed in the vicinity. Evaluation results not only provide details necessary for later applications in ubiquitous environments, but also reveal that manufacturer's specification of the eye tracker's accuracy is barely met in actual use.},

The system adopts the acoustic signal as the main medium used for the interaction, which can be handled without expensive sensors or additional resources on mobile devices. By leveraging a multi-channel microphone array on the receiving device, we build a fingerprint-based localization model using various cues, such as time difference of arrival, angle of arrival, and spectral power level of the audio signal. The technique integrates the frequency difference of arrival incurred by the Doppler shift to track the sound source in motion. Our experiments show that vTrack achieves millimeter-level granularity: 1.5mm of localization error on average in moving sound source scenario.},

In particular, mobile phone data is available as time-varying data. However, much more detailed movement that is based on network flow instead of aggregated data is needed for appropriate rescue on a real-time basis. Hence, our research aims to estimate real-time human movement during large disasters from several kinds of mobile phone data. In this paper, we simulate the movement of people in the Tokyo metropolitan area in a large disaster situation and obtain several kinds of fragmentary movement observation data from mobile phones. Our approach is to use data assimilation techniques combining with simulation of population movement and observation data. The experimental results confirm that the improvement in accuracy depends on the observation data quality using sensitivity analysis and data processing speed to satisfy each condition for real-time estimation.},

Although this usually metaphorically refers to a person's emotional state, there is literal truth in this statement with reference to a person's biological state. The eyes are dynamic and sensitive organs that are connected to the rest of the body via the circulatory and nervous systems. This means that diseases originating from an organ within the body can indirectly affect the eyes. Although the eyes may not be the origin for many such diseases, they are visible to external observers, making them an accessible point of diagnosis. For instance, broken blood vessels in the sclera could indicate a blood clotting disorder or a vitamin K deficiency. Instead of "windows to the soul", the eyes are "sensors to the body" that can be monitored to screen for certain diseases.},

In this paper we shed the light on the roles of Emojis in phone notification, we conducted an in-situ study to gather phone notification data. We outline the relationship between Emojis and various social network applications including WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. Early results allow us to draw several conclusions in relation to number, position, type and sentimental value of Emojis. It turns out that most popular Emojis in one social app is not as popular in the others. Emojis sentimental polarity in Twitter is high and overall number of Emojis is less than Facebook. The sentimental value of Emojis is more meaningful when there are multiple Emoji in one notification.},

 abstract = {Studies of visual attention during web-browsing belong to long standing applications of eye-tracking. Before researchers can analyze characteristics of visual attention, they often have to manually annotate each Area of Interest (AOI) at the web page. The longer, more complex, and dynamic the web pages are, the more time the researcher spends on creating the bounding box around each AOI. To speed up this process, we designed a browser extension that automatically extracts coordinates of visible web elements at the page as the user interacts with the page, along with the mouse activity. In our case study, the WTP automatically annotated all web elements, mouse clicks and mouse movements, and we linked the annotations with the stream of eye-tracking data. As a demonstration, we report on distribution of fixations over specific web elements during daily browsing activities. To our knowledge, this is a first tool that supports real-time automatic annotations of dynamic web-content, with a particular fit for eye-tracking research.},

Furthermore, it makes testing and updating these preliminary designs easy. By eliminating the need for coding and pattern recognition expertise, Mogeste frees the designer to explore several gesture designs in a matter of minutes. Finally, our mobile solution builds upon previous work in desktop-based authoring tools for sensor-based interactions and, in doing so, enables creative exploration by designers in naturalistic settings.},

The participants fall into three distinct groups: those whose mood correlates positively with their online activity, those who correlate negatively and those who display a weak correlation. We trained two classifiers to identify these groups using features from their online activity, which achieved precision of 95.2% and 84.4% respectively.

Recently, different approaches have been proposed to investigate the use of different sensing and phone interaction features, including location, call, SMS and overall application usage logs, to infer the depressive state of users. In this paper, we propose an approach for monitoring of depressive states using multi-modal sensing via smartphones. Through a brief literature review we show the sensing modalities that have been exploited in the past studies for monitoring depression. We then present the initial results of an ongoing study to demonstrate the association of depressive states with the smartphone interaction features. Finally, we discuss the challenges in predicting depression through multimodal mobile sensing.},

 abstract = {The energy drivers use to charge their Electric Vehicles (EVs) comes from various sources. Of those, some are renewable green energy sources such as solar photovoltaic systems (SolarPV) and home storage battery whilst some are called brown sources such as gas turbine, coal and oil. To analyse the behaviour of EV drivers as to how they use household green and brown energy, separating the mix is a necessity. This paper argues that the Internet of Things (IoT) can be helpful in achieving that goal and demonstrates a pilot study showing the process of separating the green and brown energy from the EV charging.},

 abstract = {Recent technological improvements allow us to capture an increasing share of our everyday experiences, e.g. holidays, shopping routines, or sports activities, and store them in a digital format. An interesting avenue to explore in this context is how reviewing such captured content can improve one's memories of the original events. In this position paper, we describe a planned experiment to investigate the impact of such captured recordings (and their subsequent review) on supporting work meetings. We provide the planned study procedure, explain the envisioned apparatus and metric, and describe the technology used to support the review activity.},

 abstract = {Accidents that are caused by "texting while walking" (TWW) continue to increase. Even though most people realize that this activity is risky and should be avoided, more than a few continue to engage in it. Since eradicating TWW appears difficult, using a safe-walking support system is an alternative to reduce accidents during TWW. In this paper, we first identify a TWW risk based on our preliminary experimental results, and then propose safe-walking support system. For our evaluation, we compared the collision rates among four risk assessment algorithms and three typical walking situations in an experiment and collected subjective impressions from participants by questionnaires. The observed collision rate was 12.5% with no system support, 10.8% with a typical simple system, and 6.7 at best with our proposed systems. From our questionnaire results, the proposed system's notification mechanism is easier to understand than the conventional system's.},

 abstract = {When performing a piece of music, body, senses, and cognition are strictly connected to each other. This connection, however, is not always particularly evident. As a consequence, it is extremely important for musicians to be able to control their performance by relying on other sensorial modalities that complement the auditory cue. Sight, in particular, is paramount for most instrumentalists as it helps learning new techniques, recognising errors, correcting expressiveness, and memorize complex passages. As opposed to other musicians, singers can almost exclusively rely on the auditory feedback coming from their voice to adjust their singing. Starting from this statement, we conduct a user study to find possible solutions to provide singers with further feedback during their performance. This paper is a preliminary study in this direction.},
