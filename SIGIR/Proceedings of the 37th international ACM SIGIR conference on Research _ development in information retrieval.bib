 abstract = {Welcome to SIGIR, the 36th annual international ACM conference on research and development in Information Retrieval. SIGIR is the premier, international venue for research and development in information retrieval. We believe the breadth and diversity of research that comprises the program reflects the health of the organization and major future directions of the field. We are grateful to all those who submitted papers to the conference and gave the Committee an opportunity to evaluate their work for potential inclusion in the program. We are also grateful to the 50 Area Chairs and 204 general program committee members, who represent 30 countries and over 120 institutions, for all the hard work they put into evaluating submissions. The conference received 366 full paper submissions this year. Of these, 73 (20%) were accepted, essentially the same as last year's acceptance rate and the year before. The top five countries in terms of accepted papers (according to contact author affiliation) were the U.S.A. (28), China (9), the Netherlands, Singapore, and U.K. (5 each). The top five technical areas covered by the accepted papers (as indicated by the primary keyword assigned by paper authors) were users and interactive IR (16%), search engine architecture and scalability (15%), queries and query analysis (15%), evaluation (11%), and retrieval models and ranking (11%). This represents only a slight re-ordering of topics from last year. Two hundred fifty papers were submitted to the short papers track, which represents a 20% increase in the number of submissions made to last year's poster track. Eighty-five (34%) short papers were accepted. In addition, 46 demonstrations were proposed, of which 23 (50%) were accepted. The program also consisted of 7 workshops and 10 tutorials. Finally, the Doctoral Consortium hosted 11 students this year from 10 countries and 11 institutions. As has been customary for many years, SIGIR 2013 used a two-tier double-blind review process. In the first stage, at least three reviewers read every paper and provided ratings and comments. Papers were evaluated according to seven main criteria: relevance, originality, soundness, quality of the presentation, impact, coverage of the literature, and, for the first time, reproducibility of the results. In the second stage, the primary and secondary Area Chairs ensured the quality of the reviewing process by studying, validating, and summarizing these reviews, and adding their own feedback and ratings. Area Chairs initiated discussions among reviewers to resolve any controversial issues or significant differences of opinion. Once the discussion stage was completed, the two Area Chairs made a recommendation regarding the paper for nearly all submissions. This year we allowed Area Chairs to indicate that a paper should be accepted if room. At the program committee meeting held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, the Program Chairs and the attending Area Chairs went over the reviews, verified the process, gathered additional input, and discussed and decided on papers that were balloted as accept if room, papers from which the primary Area Chair abstained and papers that had unusual score distributions. For papers that were balloted as accept if room, we especially considered the potential for the paper to provoke interesting and fruitful discussion at the conference. Ultimately 73 papers were selected for inclusion in the program. One important change to this year's program was renaming the poster paper submission type to short papers and increasing the length of the paper from two to four pages. Short papers were presented at the conference in poster format and two separate short paper sessions were included as part of the main conference program, rather than a single event collocated with an evening reception. We believe that increasing the length of the accompanying paper allows researchers to better communicate their experiments and results, which in turn, will allow this submission type to function as a more comprehensive and substantial container for small, but significant findings. We further believe this change better allows research presented in this format to get the attention it deserves. We would like to thank the Short Paper Co-Chairs for all the extra work they did this year managing this new format and the Short Paper reviewers for the great job they did handling both the larger volume of submissions and their increased size. We believe the large increase in number of submissions to this track indicates the community's receptiveness to this change. We hope you find this program interesting, provocative and inspiring, and that the conference provides you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers, practitioners and students from institutions around the world. The deadline for SIGIR 2014 is, after all, only six months away!},

Although widely adopted, we find through user rating analysis that this is not necessarily true. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level and review/document-level sentiment analysis by leveraging the results given by review-level sentiment classification to boost phrase-level sentiment polarity labeling in contextual sentiment lexicon construction tasks, using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our framework improves the precision of sentiment polarity labeling by up to 5.6%, which is a significant improvement from current approaches.},

 abstract = {The query-performance prediction task has been described as estimating retrieval effectiveness in the absence of relevance judgments. The expectations throughout the years were that improved prediction techniques would translate to improved retrieval approaches. However, this has not yet happened. Herein we provide an in-depth analysis of why this is the case. To this end, we formalize the prediction task in the most general probabilistic terms. Using this formalism we draw novel connections between tasks --- and methods used to address these tasks --- in federated search, fusion-based retrieval, and query-performance prediction. Furthermore, using formal arguments we show that the ability to estimate the probability of effective retrieval with no relevance judgments (i.e., to predict performance) implies knowledge of how to perform effective retrieval. We also explain why the expectation that using previously proposed query-performance predictors would help to improve retrieval effectiveness was not realized. This is due to a misalignment with the actual goal for which these predictors were devised: ranking queries based on the presumed effectiveness of using them for retrieval over a corpus with a specific retrieval method. Focusing on this specific prediction task, namely query ranking by presumed effectiveness, we present a novel learning-to-rank-based approach that uses Markov Random Fields. The resultant prediction quality substantially transcends that of state-of-the-art predictors.},

 abstract = {The Elias-Fano representation of monotone sequences has been recently applied to the compression of inverted indexes, showing excellent query performance thanks to its efficient random access and search operations. While its space occupancy is competitive with some state-of-the-art methods such as gamma-delta-Golomb codes and PForDelta, it fails to exploit the local clustering that inverted lists usually exhibit, namely the presence of long subsequences of close identifiers. In this paper we describe a new representation based on partitioning the list into chunks and encoding both the chunks and their endpoints with Elias-Fano, hence forming a two-level data structure. This partitioning enables the encoding to better adapt to the local statistics of the chunk, thus exploiting clustering and improving compression. We present two partition strategies, respectively with fixed and variable-length chunks. For the latter case we introduce a linear-time optimization algorithm which identifies the minimum-space partition up to an arbitrarily small approximation factor. We show that our partitioned Elias-Fano indexes offer significantly better compression than plain Elias-Fano, while preserving their query time efficiency. Furthermore, compared with other state-of-the-art compressed encodings, our indexes exhibit the best compression ratio/query time trade-off.},

Yet, it is not clear what kind of assistance is most useful, and how effective it is both objectively (e.g., in terms of task success) and subjectively (e.g., in terms of searcher percep- tion of the search difficulty). This work describes the results of a controlled user study comparing the effects of provid- ing specific vs. generic search hints on search success and satisfaction. Our results indicate that specific search hints tend to effectively improve searcher success rates and reduce perceived effort, while generic ones can be detrimental in both search effectiveness and user satisfaction. The results of this study are an important step towards the design of future search systems that could effectively assist and guide the user in accomplishing complex search tasks.},

 abstract = {Volunteers are extremely crucial to nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to sustain their continuing operations. On the other hand, many talents are looking for appropriate volunteer opportunities to realize their dreams of making an impact on the world with their expertise. This is a typical supply and demand matching issue. Fortunately, user profiling and the discovery of user volunteering tendency can benefit from users' continuous enthusiasm and active participation in diverse online social networks (OSNs) and the huge amount of publicly available user generated contents (UGCs). In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between the supply of talents with volunteering tendency and the demands of social enterprise and enhance the social welfare. This is done by incorporating volunteering tendency into user profiling across multiple OSNs. Consequently, this interdisciplinary research opens a new window for both computer science and social science. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to tackle the problem of volunteer matching for social enterprise based on publicly available UGCs. First, we explain the definitions of the main concepts with examples. Second, we propose a system architecture for addressing the problem of volunteerism matching that Includes three components: Profile Collection, Profile Enrichment and Profile Matching. Finally, we identify the major challenges encountered in our current research work. This paper discusses our design and progress in this research.},

This century, it is about mining vast data sets of past user behaviors, simple algorithms, and using those to correct mistakes. The large Internet giants are data-driven enterprises that use data to transform and continually improve user experiences. In this talk, Hugh Williams shares stories about data and how it is used to build Internet products, and explains why he believes data will transform businesses as we know them. Every major company is becoming a data-driven company, and Hugh shares examples of transformations occurring in health, aviation, farming, and telecommunications. He recently joined Pivotal, a company that is assembling the toolkit that exists in only a few consumer Internet companies, and making that toolkit open and available to every industry, including big data platforms, development frameworks, and an open, cloud-independent Platform-as-a-Service. He will conclude by sharing details about Pivotal, the Pivotal vision, and roadmap. Hugh E. Williams has been Senior Vice President of Research & Development at Pivotal since January 2014. His teams build big data technologies, and development frameworks and services, including Pivotal's Hadoop, Spring Java framework, and Greenplum database offerings. Most recently, he spent four and a half years as an executive with eBay where he was responsible for the team that conceived, designed, and built eBay's user experiences, search engine, big data technologies and platforms. Prior to joining eBay, he managed an R&D team at Microsoft's Bing for four and a half years, spent over ten years researching and developing search technologies, and ran his own startup and consultancy for several years. He has published over 100 works, mostly in the field of Information Retrieval, including two books for O'Reilly Media Inc. He holds 19 U.S. patents, with many more pending.

 abstract = {Query auto-completion (QAC) facilitates faster user query input by predicting users' intended queries. Most QAC algorithms take a learning-based approach to incorporate various signals for query relevance prediction. However, such models are trained on simulat- ed user inputs from query log data. The lack of real user interaction data in the QAC process prevents them from further improving the QAC performance. In this work, for the first time we collect a high-resolution QAC query log that records every keystroke in a QAC session. Based on this data, we discover two user behaviors, namely the horizontal skipping bias and vertical position bias which are crucial for rele- vance prediction in QAC. In order to better explain them, we pro- pose a novel two-dimensional click model for modeling the QAC process with emphasis on these behaviors. Extensive experiments on our QAC data set from both PC and mobile devices demonstrate that our proposed model can accurate- ly explain the users' behaviors in interacting with a QAC system, and the resulting relevance model significant improves the QAC performance over existing click models. Furthermore, the learned knowledge about the skipping behavior can be effectively incorpo- rated into existing learning-based models to further improve their performance.},

Two main factors that are widely acknowledged to be the most influential ones are neighboring ads and presentation order. The latter is referred to as positional effect. A popular practice to recover the ads quality cleaned from positional bias is to adopt click models based on examination or cascade hypothesis originally developed for organic search. In this paper we show the strong evidence that this practice is far from perfection when considering the top ads block on a search engine result page (SERP). We show that cascade hypothesis is the most questionable one because of important differences between organic and sponsored search results that may encourage users to analyze the whole ads-block before clicking. Additionally, we design a testing setup for an unbiased evaluation of click model prediction accuracy.},

 abstract = {Users often reformulate or modify their queries when they engage in searching information particularly when the search task is complex and exploratory. This paper investigates query reformulation behavior in collaborative tourism information searching on the Web. A user study was conducted with 17 pairs of participants and each pair worked as a team collaboratively on an exploratory travel search task in two scenarios. We analyzed users' collaborative query (CQ) reformulation behavior in two dimensions: firstly, CQ reformulation strategies; and secondly, the effect of individual queries and chat logs on CQ reformulation. The findings show that individual queries and chat logs were two major sources of query terms in CQ reformulation. The statistical results demonstrate the significant effect of individual queries on CQ reformulation. We also found that five operations were performed to reformulate the CQs, namely: addition, modification, reordering, addition and modification, and addition and reordering. These findings have implications for the design of query suggestions that could be offered to users during searches using collaborative search tools.},

 abstract = {This research falls in the area of enhancing the quality of tag-based item recommendation systems. It aims to achieve this by employing a multi-dimensional user profile approach and by analyzing the semantic aspects of tags. Tag-based recommender systems have two characteristics that need to be carefully studied in order to build a reliable system. Firstly, the multi-dimensional correlation, called as tag assignment (user, item, tag), should be appropriately modelled in order to create the user profiles [1]. Secondly, the semantics behind the tags should be considered properly as the flexibility with their design can cause semantic problems such as synonymy and polysemy [2]. This research proposes to address these two challenges for building a tag-based item recommendation system by employing tensor modeling as the multi-dimensional user profile approach, and the topic model as the semantic analysis approach. The first objective is to optimize the tensor model reconstruction and to improve the model performance in generating quality recommendation. A novel Tensor-based Recommendation using Probabilistic Ranking (TRPR) method [3] has been developed. Results show this method to be scalable for large datasets and outperforming the benchmarking methods in terms of accuracy. The memory efficient loop implements the n-mode block-striped (matrix) product for tensor reconstruction as an approximation of the initial tensor. The probabilistic ranking calculates the probability of users to select candidate items using their tag preference list based on the entries generated from the reconstructed tensor. The second objective is to analyse the tag semantics and utilize the outcome in building the tensor model. This research proposes to investigate the problem using topic model approach to keep the tags nature as the "social vocabulary" [4]. For the tag assignment data, topics can be generated from the occurrences of tags given for an item. However there is only limited amount of tags available to represent items as collection of topics, since an item might have only been tagged by using several tags. Consequently, the generated topics might not able to represent the items appropriately. Furthermore, given that each tag can belong to any topics with various probability scores, the occurrence of tags cannot simply be mapped by the topics to build the tensor model. A standard weighting technique will not appropriately calculate the value of tagging activity since it will define the context of an item using a tag instead of a topic.},

 abstract = {The past 20 years have seen a great improvement in the rigor of information retrieval experimentation, due primarily to two factors: high-quality, public, portable test collections such as those produced by TREC (the Text REtrieval Con- ference [2]), and the increased practice of statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether measured improvements can be ascribed to something other than random chance. Together these create a very useful standard for reviewers, program committees, and journal editors; work in information retrieval (IR) increasingly cannot be published unless it has been evaluated using a well-constructed test collection and shown to produce a statistically significant improvement over a good baseline. But, as the saying goes, any tool sharp enough to be useful is also sharp enough to be dangerous. Statistical tests of significance are widely misunderstood. Most researchers treat them as a "black box": evaluation results go in and a p-value comes out. Because significance is such an important factor in determining what research directions to explore and what is published, using p-values obtained without thought can have consequences for everyone doing research in IR. Ioannidis has argued that the main consequence in the biomedical sciences is that most published research findings are false; could that be the case in IR as well?},

Web search is a perfect backdrop for circumlocution where people struggle to name what they seek. In some domains, not knowing the correct term can have a significant impact on the search results that are retrieved. We study the medical domain, where professional medical terms are not commonly known and where the consequence of not knowing the correct term can impact the accuracy of surfaced information, as well as escalation of anxiety, and ultimately the medical care sought. Given a free-form colloquial health search query, our objective is to find the underlying professional medical term. The problem is complicated by the fact that people issue quite varied queries to describe what they have. Machine-learning algorithms can be brought to bear on the problem, but there are two key complexities: creating high-quality training data and identifying predictive features. To our knowledge, no prior work has been able to crack this important problem due to the lack of training data. We give novel solutions and demonstrate their efficacy via extensive experiments, greatly improving over the prior art.},

 abstract = {Trending search suggestion is leading a new paradigm of image search, where user's exploratory search experience is facilitated with the automatic suggestion of trending queries. Existing image search engines, however, only provide general suggestions and hence cannot capture user's personal interest. In this paper, we move one step forward to investigate personalized suggestion of trending image searches according to users' search behaviors. To this end, we propose a learning-based framework including two novel components. The first component, i.e., trending-aware weight-regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF), is able to suggest personalized trending search queries by learning user preference from many users as well as auxiliary common searches. The second component associates the most representative and trending image with each suggested query. The personalized suggestion of image search consists of a trending textual query and its associated trending image. The combined textual-visual queries not only are trending (bursty) and personalized to user's search preference, but also provide the compelling visual aspect of these queries. We evaluate our proposed learning-based framework on a large-scale search logs with 21 million users and 41 million queries in two weeks from a commercial image search engine. The evaluations demonstrate that our system achieve about 50% gain compared with state-of-the-art in terms of query prediction accuracy.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the space-time performance of in-memory conjunctive list intersection algorithms, as used in search engines, where integers represent document identifiers. We demonstrate that the combination of bitvectors, large skips, delta compressed lists and URL ordering produces superior results to using skips or bitvectors alone. We define semi-bitvectors, a new partial bitvector data structure that stores the front of the list using a bitvector and the remainder using skips and delta compression. To make it particularly effective, we propose that documents be ordered so as to skew the postings lists to have dense regions at the front. This can be accomplished by grouping documents by their size in a descending manner and then reordering within each group using URL ordering. In each list, the division point between bitvector and delta compression can occur at any group boundary. We explore the performance of semi-bitvectors using the GOV2 dataset for various numbers of groups, resulting in significant space-time improvements over existing approaches. Semi-bitvectors do not directly support ranking. Indeed, bitvectors are not believed to be useful for ranking based search systems, because frequencies and offsets cannot be included in their structure. To refute this belief, we propose several approaches to improve the performance of ranking-based search systems using bitvectors, and leave their verification for future work. These proposals suggest that bitvectors, and more particularly semi-bitvectors, warrant closer examination by the research community.},

We find that relational syntactic features generated by structural kernels are effective for learning to rank (L2R) and can easily be combined with those of other existing systems to boost their accuracy. In particular, the results show that our L2R approach improves on almost all the participating systems at TREC, only using their raw scores as a single feature.

 abstract = {Recommender system has become an important component in modern eCommerce. Recent research on recommender systems has been mainly concentrating on improving the relevance or profitability of individual recommended items. But in reality, users are usually exposed to a set of items and they may buy multiple items in one single order. Thus, the relevance or profitability of one item may actually depend on the other items in the set. In other words, the set of recommendations is a bundle with items interacting with each other. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem called the Bundle Recommendation Problem (BRP). By solving the BRP, we are able to find the optimal bundle of items to recommend with respect to preferred business objective. However, BRP is a large-scale NP-hard problem. We then show that it may be sufficient to solve a significantly smaller version of BRP depending on properties of input data. This allows us to solve BRP in real-world applications with millions of users and items. Both offline and online experimental results on a Walmart.com demonstrate the incremental value of solving BRP across multiple baseline models.},

Ineffective queries usually fail to incorporate important terms and/or incorrectly include inappropriate keywords. However, in this paper we show another cause of reduced search performance: sometimes users issue reasonable query terms, but systems cannot identify the correct properties of those terms and take advantages of the properties. Specifically, we study two distinct types of terms that exist in all search queries: (1) necessary terms, for which term occurrence alone is indicative of document relevance; and (2) frequent terms, for which the relative term frequency is indicative of document relevance within the set of documents where the term appears. We evaluate these two properties of query terms in a dataset. Results show that only 1/3 of the terms are both necessary and frequent, while another 1/3 only hold one of the properties and the final third do not hold any of the properties. However, existing retrieval models do not clearly distinguish terms with the two properties and consider them differently. We further show the great potential of improving retrieval models by treating terms with distinct properties differently.},

We address a setting wherein the list for which feedback is provided results from fusing several intermediate retrieved lists. Accordingly, we devise methods that utilize the feedback while exploiting the special characteristics of the fusion setting. Specifically, the feedback serves two different, yet complementary, purposes. The first is to directly rank the pool of documents in the intermediate lists. The second is to estimate the effectiveness of the intermediate lists for improved re-fusion. In addition, we present a meta fusion method that uses the feedback for these two purposes simultaneously. Empirical evaluation demonstrates the merits of our approach. As a case in point, the retrieval performance is substantially better than that of using the relevance feedback as in the single list setting. The performance also substantially transcends that of a previously proposed approach to utilizing relevance feedback in fusion-based retrieval.},

This paper presents insights about people search behavior on LinkedIn, based on a log analysis and a user study. In particular, it examines the role that network distance plays in name searches and non-name searches. For name searches, users primarily click on only one of the results, and closer network distance leads to higher click-through rates. In contrast, for non-name searches, users are more likely to click on multiple results that are not in their existing connections, but with whom they have shared connections. The results show that, while network distance contributes significantly to LinkedIn search engagement in general, its role varies dramatically depending on the type of search query.},

 abstract = {Web search engines utilize behavioral signals to develop search experiences tailored to individual users. To be effective, such personalization relies on access to sufficient information about each user's interests and intentions. For new users or new queries, profile information may be sparse or non-existent. To handle these cases, and perhaps also improve personalization for those with profiles, search engines can employ signals from users who are similar along one or more dimensions, i.e., those in the same cohort. In this paper we describe a characterization and evaluation of the use of such cohort modeling to enhance search personalization. We experiment with three pre-defined cohorts-topic, location, and top-level domain preference-independently and in combination, and also evaluate methods to learn cohorts dynamically. We show via extensive experimentation with large-scale logs from a commercial search engine that leveraging cohort behavior can yield significant relevance gains when combined with a production search engine ranking algorithm that uses similar classes of personalization signal but at the individual searcher level. Additional experiments show that our gains can be extended when we dynamically learn cohorts and target easily-identifiable classes of ambiguous or unseen queries.},

 abstract = {For many languages that use non-Roman based indigenous scripts (e.g., Arabic, Greek and Indic languages) one can often find a large amount of user generated transliterated content on the Web in the Roman script. Such content creates a monolingual or multi-lingual space with more than one script which we refer to as the Mixed-Script space. IR in the mixed-script space is challenging because queries written in either the native or the Roman script need to be matched to the documents written in both the scripts. Moreover, transliterated content features extensive spelling variations. In this paper, we formally introduce the concept of Mixed-Script IR, and through analysis of the query logs of Bing search engine, estimate the prevalence and thereby establish the importance of this problem. We also give a principled solution to handle the mixed-script term matching and spelling variation where the terms across the scripts are modelled jointly in a deep-learning architecture and can be compared in a low-dimensional abstract space. We present an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed method along with the evaluation results in an ad-hoc retrieval setting of mixed-script IR where the proposed method achieves significantly better results (12% increase in MRR and 29% increase in MAP) compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.},

For reliability, the key question is the extent to which privilege judgments correctly reflect the opinion of the senior litigator whose judgment is authoritative. For reusability, the key question is the degree to which systems whose results contributed to creation of the test collection can be fairly compared with other systems that use those privilege judgments in the future.

 abstract = {With the rise in popularity of smart phones, taking and sharing photographs has never been more openly accessible. Further, photo sharing websites, such as Flickr, have made the distribution of photographs easy, resulting in an increase of visual content uploaded online. Due to the laborious nature of annotating images, however, a large percentage of these images are unannotated making their organisation and retrieval difficult. Therefore, there has been a recent research focus on the automatic and semi-automatic process of annotating these images. Despite the progress made in this field, however, annotating images automatically based on their visual appearance often results in unsatisfactory suggestions and as a result these models have not been adopted in photo sharing websites. Many methods have therefore looked to exploit new sources of evidence for annotation purposes, such as image context for example. In this demonstration, we instead explore the scenario of annotating images taken at a large scale events where evidences can be extracted from a wealth of online textual resources. Specifically, we present a novel tag recommendation system for images taken at a popular music festival which allows the user to select relevant tags from related Tweets and Wikipedia content, thus reducing the workload involved in the annotation process.},

Advanced technologies based on machine learning have been developed. Let us take Web search as example of the problem that also pervades the other tasks. When comparing the textual content of query and documents, Web search still heavily relies on the term-based approach, where the relevance scores between queries and documents are calculated on the basis of the degree of matching between query terms and document terms. This simple approach works rather well in practice, partly because there are many other signals in web search (hypertext, user logs, etc.) that complement it. However, when considering the long tail of web searches, it can suffer from data sparseness, e.g., Trenton does not match New Jersey Capital. Query document mismatches occur when searcher and author use different terms (representations), and this phenomenon is prevalent due to the nature of human language.},

In the existing approaches, groups of similar users are often statically determined, e.g., based on the common documents that users clicked. However, these static grouping methods are query-independent and neglect the fact that users in a group may have different interests with respect to different topics. In this paper, we argue that common interest groups should be dynamically constructed in response to the user's input query. We propose a personalisation framework in which a user profile is enriched using information from other users dynamically grouped with respect to an input query. The experimental results on query logs from a major commercial web search engine demonstrate that our framework improves the performance of the web search engine and also achieves better performance than the static grouping method.},

As with all online images, they are often poorly annotated, resulting in a difficult retrieval scenario. To overcome this problem, many photo tag recommendation methods have been introduced, however, these methods all rely on historical Flickr data which is often problematic for a number of reasons, including the time lag problem (i.e. in our collection, users upload images on average 50 days after taking them, meaning "training data" is often out of date). In this paper, we develop an image annotation model which exploits textual content from related Twitter and Wikipedia data which aims to overcome the discussed problems. The results of our experiments show and highlight the merits of exploiting social media data for annotating event images, where we are able to achieve recommendation accuracy comparable with a state-of-the-art model.},

 abstract = {Compression of collections, such as text databases, can both reduce space consumption and increase retrieval efficiency, through better caching and better exploitation of the memory hierarchy. A promising technique is relative Lempel-Ziv coding, in which a sample of material from the collection serves as a static dictionary; in previous work, this method demonstrated extremely fast decoding and good compression ratios, while allowing random access to individual items. However, there is a trade-off between dictionary size and compression ratio, motivating the search for a compact, yet similarly effective, dictionary. In previous work it was observed that, since the dictionary is generated by sampling, some of it (selected substrings) may be discarded with little loss in compression. Unfortunately, simple dictionary pruning approaches are ineffective. We develop a formal model of our approach, based on generating an optimal dictionary for a given collection within a memory bound. We generate measures for identification of low-value substrings in the dictionary, and show on a variety of sizes of text collection that halving the dictionary size leads to only marginal loss in compression ratio. This is a dramatic improvement on previous approaches.},

In this tutorial, we shall explain the concept of retrievability along with a number of retrievability measures, how it can be estimated and how it can be used for analysis. Since retrieval precedes relevance, we shall also provide an overview of how retrievability relates to effectiveness - describing some of the insights that researchers have discovered so far. We shall also show how retrievability relates to efficiency, and how the theory of retrievability can be used to improve both effectiveness and efficiency. Then we shall provide an overview of the different applications of retrievability such as Search Engine Bias, Corpus Profiling, etc., before wrapping up with challenges and opportunities. The final session of the day will look at example problems and ways to analyse and apply retrievability to other problems and domains.},

 abstract = {In the current Web 2.0 era, the popularity of Web resources fluctuates ephemerally, based on trends and social interest. As a result, content-based relevance signals are insufficient to meet users' constantly evolving information needs in searching for Web 2.0 items. Incorporating future popularity into ranking is one way to counter this. However, predicting popularity as a third party (as in the case of general search engines) is difficult in practice, due to their limited access to item view histories. To enable popularity prediction externally without excessive crawling, we propose an alternative solution by leveraging user comments, which are more accessible than view counts. Due to the sparsity of comments, traditional solutions that are solely based on view histories do not perform well. To deal with this sparsity, we mine comments to recover additional signal, such as social influence. By modeling comments as a time-aware bipartite graph, we propose a regularization-based ranking algorithm that accounts for temporal, social influence and current popularity factors to predict the future popularity of items. Experimental results on three real-world datasets --- crawled from YouTube, Flickr and Last.fm --- show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines in several evaluation tasks.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems using Collaborative Filtering techniques are capable of make personalized predictions. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to profile injection attacks. Group attacks are attacks that target a group of items instead of one, and there are common attributes among these items. Such profiles will have a good probability of being similar to a large number of user profiles, making them hard to detect. We propose a novel technique for identifying group attack profiles which uses an improved metric based on Degree of Similarity with Top Neighbors (DegSim) and Rating Deviation from Mean Agreement (RDMA). We also extend our work with a detailed analysis of target item rating patterns. Experiments show that the combined methods can improve detection rates in user-based recommender systems.},

The best known matrix-based method [1] for calculating SimRank, however, implies an assumption that the graph is non-singular, its adjacency matrix is invertible. In reality, non-singular graphs are very rare; such an assumption in [1] is too restrictive in practice. In this paper, we provide a treatment of [1], by supporting similarity assessment on non-invertible adjacency matrices. Assume that a singular graph G has n nodes, with r(2},

Using large scale query log analysis, we characterize what people do when they return to a result page after having visited an initial result. We find that the initial click provides insight into the searcher's subsequent behavior, with short initial dwell times suggesting more future interaction and later clicks occurring close in rank to the first. Although users think of a search result list as static, when people return to a result list following a click there is the opportunity for the list to change, potentially providing additional relevant content. Such change, however, can be confusing, leading to increased abandonment and slower subsequent clicks. We explore the risks and opportunities of changing search results during use, observing, for example, that when results change above a user's initial click that user is less likely to find new content, whereas changes below correlate with increased subsequent interaction. Our results can be used to improve people's search experience during the course of a single query by seamlessly providing new, more relevant content as the user interacts with a search result page, helping them find what they are looking for without having to issue a new query.},

Studying evolution of product entities can help analysts understand the change in particular attribute values for these products. However, studying the evolution of a product requires us to be able to link various versions of a product together in a temporal order. While it is easy to temporally link recent versions of products in a few domains manually, solving the problem in general is challenging. The ability to temporally order and link various versions of a single product can also improve product search engines. In this paper, we tackle the problem of finding the previous version (predecessor) of a product entity. Given a repository of product entities, we first parse the product names using a CRF model. After identifying entities corresponding to a single product, we solve the problem of finding the previous version of any given particular version of the product. For the second task, we leverage innovative features with a Naïve Bayes classifier. Our methods achieve a precision of 88% in identifying the product version from product entity names, and a precision of 53% in identifying the predecessor.},

 abstract = {Similarity search methods based on hashing for effective and efficient cross-modal retrieval on large-scale multimedia databases with massive text and images have attracted considerable attention. The core problem of cross-modal hashing is how to effectively construct correlation between multi-modal representations which are heterogeneous intrinsically in the process of hash function learning. Analogous to Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), most existing cross-modal hash methods embed the heterogeneous data into a joint abstraction space by linear projections. However, these methods fail to bridge the semantic gap more effectively, and capture high-level latent semantic information which has been proved that it can lead to better performance for image retrieval. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Latent Semantic Sparse Hashing (LSSH) to perform cross-modal similarity search by employing Sparse Coding and Matrix Factorization. In particular, LSSH uses Sparse Coding to capture the salient structures of images, and Matrix Factorization to learn the latent concepts from text. Then the learned latent semantic features are mapped to a joint abstraction space. Moreover, an iterative strategy is applied to derive optimal solutions efficiently, and it helps LSSH to explore the correlation between multi-modal representations efficiently and automatically. Finally, the unified hashcodes are generated through the high level abstraction space by quantization. Extensive experiments on three different datasets highlight the advantage of our method under cross-modal scenarios and show that LSSH significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.},

 abstract = {There are many existing studies of user behavior in simple tasks (e.g., navigational and informational search) within a short duration of 1--2 queries. However, we know relatively little about user behavior, especially browsing and clicking behavior, for longer search session solving complex search tasks. In this paper, we characterize and compare user behavior in relatively long search sessions (10 minutes; about 5 queries) for search tasks of four different types. The tasks differ in two dimensions: (1) the user is locating facts or is pursuing intellectual understanding of a topic; (2) the user has a specific task goal or has an ill-defined and undeveloped goal. We analyze how search behavior as well as browsing and clicking patterns change during a search session in these different tasks. Our results indicate that user behavior in the four types of tasks differ in various aspects, including search activeness, browsing style, clicking strategy, and query reformulation. As a search session progresses, we note that users shift their interests to focus less on the top results but more on results ranked at lower positions in browsing. We also found that results eventually become less and less attractive for the users. The reasons vary and include downgraded search performance of query, decreased novelty of search results, and decaying persistence of users in browsing. Our study highlights the lack of long session support in existing search engines and suggests different strategies of supporting longer sessions according to different task types.},

As result pages become more complex, click models evolve as well in order to capture additional aspects of user behavior in response to new forms of result presentation. We propose a method for evaluating the intuitiveness of vertical-aware click models, namely the ability of a click model to capture key aspects of aggregated result pages, such as vertical selection, item selection, result presentation and vertical diversity. This method allows us to isolate model components and therefore gives a multi-faceted view on a model's performance. We argue that our method can be used in conjunction with traditional click model evaluation metrics such as log-likelihood or perplexity. In order to demonstrate the power of our method in situations where result pages can contain more than one type of vertical(e.g., Image and News) we extend the previously studied Federated Click Model such that it models user clicks on such pages. Our evaluation method yields non-trivial yet interpretable conclusions about the intuitiveness of click models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.},

Many state of the art methods are based on eigenvalue decomposition. In these approaches, the information caught in different dimensions is unbalanced and generally most of the information is contained in the top eigenvectors. We demonstrate that this leads to an unexpected phenomenon that longer hashing code does not necessarily yield better performance. In this work, we introduce a random subspace strategy to address this limitation. At first, a small fraction of the whole feature space is randomly sampled to train the hashing algorithms each time and only the top eigenvectors are kept to generate one piece of short code. This process will be repeated several times and then the obtained many pieces of short codes are concatenated into one piece of long code. Theoretical analysis and experiments on two benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for hashing.},

 abstract = {Authorship attribution (AA) aims to identify the authors of a set of documents. Traditional studies in this area often assume that there are a large set of labeled documents available for training. However, in the real life, it is hard or expensive to collect a large set of labeled data. For example, in the online review domain, most reviewers (authors) only write a few reviews, which are not enough to serve as the training data for accurate classification. In this paper, we present a novel two-view co-training framework to iteratively identify the authors of a few unlabeled data to augment the training set. The key idea is to first represent each document as several distinct views, and then a co-training technique is adopted to exploit the large amount of unlabeled documents. Starting from 10 training texts per author, we systematically evaluate the effectiveness of co-training for authorship attribution with limited labeled data. Two methods and three views are investigated: logistic regression (LR) and support vector machines (SVM) methods, and character, lexical, and syntactic views. The experimental results show that LR is particularly effective for improving co-training in AA, and the lexical view performs the best among three views when combined with a LR classifier. Furthermore, the co-training framework does not make much difference between one classifier from two views and two classifiers from one view. Instead, it is the learning approach and the view that plays a critical role.},

Furthermore, by using a novel indexing and matching model, the system is aimed at searching for similar mathematical formulae based on both textual and spatial similarities. A hierarchical generalization technique is proposed to generate sub-trees from the semi-operator tree of formulae and support substructure match and fuzzy match.

Algorithms that extract writing style features from texts are used to determine how close in style different documents are. Currently, evaluations of author verification algorithms are restricted to small-scale corpora with usually less than one hundred test cases. In this work, we present a methodology to derive a large-scale author verification corpus based on Wikipedia Talkpages. We create a corpus based on English Wikipedia which is significantly larger than existing corpora. We investigate two dimensions on this corpus which so far have not received sufficient attention: the influence of topic and the influence of time on author verification accuracy.},

 abstract = {Web search queries without hyperlink clicks are often referred to as abandoned queries. Understanding the reasons for abandonment is crucial for search engines in evaluating their performance. Abandonment can be categorized as good or bad depending on whether user information needs are satisfied by result page content. Previous research has sought to understand abandonment rationales via user surveys, or has developed models to predict those rationales using behavioral patterns. However, these models ignore important contextual factors such as the relationship between the abandoned query and prior abandonment instances. We propose more advanced methods for modeling and predicting abandonment rationales using contextual information from user search sessions by analyzing search engine logs, and discover dependencies between abandoned queries and user behaviors. We leverage these dependency signals to build a sequential classifier using a structured learning framework designed to handle such signals. Our experimental results show that our approach is 22% more accurate than the state-of-the-art abandonment-rationale classifier. Going beyond prediction, we leverage the prediction results to significantly improve relevance using instances of predicted good and bad abandonment.},

We thus propose to model session search as a dual-agent stochastic game: the user agent and the search engine agent work together to jointly maximize their long term rewards. The framework, which we term "win-win search", is based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We mathematically model dynamics in session search, including decision states, query changes, clicks, and rewards, as a cooperative game between the user and the search engine.

However, an in-depth analysis on the interplay between the response latency of web search systems and users' search experience has been missing so far. In order to fill this gap, we conduct two separate studies aiming to reveal how response latency affects the user behavior in web search. First, we conduct a controlled user study trying to understand how users perceive the response latency of a search system and how sensitive they are to increasing delays in response. This study reveals that, when artificial delays are introduced into the response, the users of a fast search system are more likely to notice these delays than the users of a slow search system. The introduced delays become noticeable by the users once they exceed a certain threshold value. Second, we perform an analysis using a large-scale query log obtained from Yahoo web search to observe the potential impact of increasing response latency on the click behavior of users. This analysis demonstrates that latency has an impact on the click behavior of users to some extent. In particular, given two content-wise identical search result pages, we show that the users are more likely to perform clicks on the result page that is served with lower latency.},

In this paper, we define a novel task of cross-language context-aware citation recommendation, which aims at recommending English citations for a given context of the place where a citation is made in a Chinese paper. This task is very challenging because the contexts and citations are written in different languages and there exists a language gap when matching them. To tackle this problem, we propose the bilingual context-citation embedding algorithm (i.e. BLSRec-I), which can learn a low-dimensional joint embedding space for both contexts and citations. Moreover, two advanced algorithms named BLSRec-II and BLSRec-III are proposed by enhancing BLSRec-I with translation results and abstract information, respectively. We evaluate the proposed methods based on a real dataset that contains Chinese contexts and English citations. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can outperform a few baselines and the BLSRec-II and BLSRec-III methods can outperform the BLSRec-I method.},

Within the framework, different amounts of assessing effort is placed on different regions of the ranked lists as defined by a sampling strategy. The sampling strategy is critically important to the quality of the resultant collection, but there is little published guidance as to the important factors. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect on collection quality of different sampling strategies within the inferred measures framework. The quality of a collection is measured by how accurately it distinguishes the set of significantly different system pairs. Top-K pooling is competitive, though not the best strategy because it cannot distinguish topics with large relevant set sizes. Incorporating a deep, very sparsely sampled stratum is a poor choice. Strategies that include a top-10 pool create better collections than those that do not, as well as allow Precision(10) scores to be directly computed.},

In this paper, we view the influence maximization problem from the perspective of data reconstruction and propose a novel framework named \textsl{Data Reconstruction for Influence Maximization}(DRIM). In our framework, we first construct an influence matrix, each row of which is the influence of a node to other nodes. Then, we select $k$ most informative rows to reconstruct the matrix and the corresponding nodes are the seed nodes which could maximize the influence spread. Finally, we evaluate our framework on two real-world data sets, and the results show that DRIM is at least as effective as the traditional greedy algorithm.},

It implies that a significant fraction of categories, referred to as rare categories, have very few documents assigned to them. This characteristic of the data makes it harder for learning algorithms to learn effective decision boundaries which can correctly detect such categories in the test set. In this work, we exploit the distribution of documents among categories to (i) derive an upper bound on the accuracy of any classifier, and (ii) propose a ranking-based algorithm which aims to maximize this upper bound.

 abstract = {Existing work on collaborative filtering (CF) is often based on the overall ratings the items have received. However, in many cases, understanding how a user rates each aspect of an item may reveal more detailed information about her preferences and thus may lead to more effective CF. Prior work has studied extracting/quantizing sentiments on different aspects from the reviews, based on which the unknown overall ratings are inferred. However, in that work, all the aspects are treated equally; while in reality, different users tend to place emphases on difference aspects when reaching the overall rating. For example, users may give a high rating to a movie just for its plot despite its mediocre performances. This emphasis on aspects varies for different users and different items. In this paper, we propose a method that uses tensor factorization to automatically infer the weights of different aspects in forming the overall rating. The main idea is to learn, through constrained optimization, a compact representation of a weight tensor indexed by three dimensions for user, item, and aspect, respectively. Overall ratings can then be predicted using the obtained weights. Experiments on a movie dataset show that our method compares favorably with three baseline methods.},

Local experts -- in contrast to general topic experts -- have specialized knowledge focused around a particular location, and are important for many applications including answering local information needs and interacting with community experts. And yet identifying these experts is difficult. Hence in this paper, we propose a geo-spatial-driven approach for identifying local experts that leverages the fine-grained GPS coordinates of millions of Twitter users. We propose a local expertise framework that integrates both users' topical expertise and their local authority. Concretely, we estimate a user's local authority via a novel spatial proximity expertise approach that leverages over 15 million geo-tagged Twitter lists. We estimate a user's topical expertise based on expertise propagation over 600 million geo-tagged social connections on Twitter. We evaluate the proposed approach across 56 queries coupled with over 11,000 individual judgments from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find significant improvement over both general (non-local) expert approaches and comparable local expert finding approaches.},

 abstract = {Text-based social media channels, such as Twitter, produce torrents of opinionated data about the most diverse topics and entities. The analysis of such data (aka. sentiment analysis) is quickly becoming a key feature in recommender systems and search engines. A prominent approach to sentiment analysis is based on the application of classification techniques, that is, content is classified according to the attitude of the writer. A major challenge, however, is that Twitter follows the data stream model, and thus classifiers must operate with limited resources, including labeled data and time for building classification models. Also challenging is the fact that sentiment distribution may change as the stream evolves. In this paper we address these challenges by proposing algorithms that select relevant training instances at each time step, so that training sets are kept small while providing to the classifier the capabilities to suit itself to, and to recover itself from, different types of sentiment drifts. Simultaneously providing capabilities to the classifier, however, is a conflicting-objective problem, and our proposed algorithms employ basic notions of Economics in order to balance both capabilities. We performed the analysis of events that reverberated on Twitter, and the comparison against the state-of-the-art reveals improvements both in terms of error reduction (up to 14%) and reduction of training resources (by orders of magnitude).},

 abstract = {Most of the previous approaches surrounding collaborative information retrieval (CIR) provide either a user-based mediation, in which the system only supports users' collaborative activities, or a system-based mediation, in which the system plays an active part in balancing user roles, re-ranking results, and distributing them to optimize overall retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose to combine both of these approaches by a role mining methodology that learns from users' actions about the retrieval strategy they adapt. This hybrid method aims at showing how users are different and how to use these differences for suggesting roles. The core of the method is expressed as an algorithm that (1) monitors users' actions in a CIR setting; (2) discovers differences among the collaborators along certain dimensions; and (3) suggests appropriate roles to make the most out of individual skills and optimize IR performance. Our approach is empirically evaluated and relies on two different laboratory studies involving 70 pairs of users. Our experiments show promising results that highlight how role mining could optimize the collaboration within a search session. The contributions of this work include a new algorithm for mining user roles in collaborative IR, an evaluation methodology, and a new approach to improve IR performance with the operationalization of user-driven system-mediated collaboration.},

We propose an approach for identifying the orientations in search results at scale, through a novel technique that minimizes the expected number of human judgments required. We apply PAWS to news search on Google and Bing, and find no evidence that the engines emphasize results that express positive orientation toward the engine company's products. We do find that the engines emphasize particular news sites, and that they also favor pages containing their company's advertisements, as opposed to competitor advertisements.},

More specifically, we like to extract each point-of-interest (POI) mention in a tweet and predict whether the user has visited, is currently at, or will soon visit this POI. Our proposed solution, named PETAR, consists of two main components: a POI inventory and a time-aware POI tagger. The POI inventory is built by exploiting the crowd wisdom of Foursquare community. It contains not only the formal names of POIs but also the informal abbreviations. The POI tagger, based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, is designed to simultaneously identify the POIs and resolve their associated temporal awareness. In our experiments, we investigated four types of features (i.e., lexical, grammatical, geographical, and BILOU schema features) for time-aware POI extraction. With the four types of features, PETAR achieves promising extraction accuracy and outperforms all baseline methods.},

Most existing methods on this problem utilize a heuristic predefined ranking function, where limited features can be incorporated and extensive tuning is required for different settings. In this paper, we address search result diversification as a learning problem, and introduce a novel relational learning-to-rank approach to formulate the task. However, the definitions of ranking function and loss function for the diversification problem are challenging. In our work, we firstly show that diverse ranking is in general a sequential selection process from both empirical and theoretical aspects. On this basis, we define ranking function as the combination of relevance score and diversity score between the current document and those previously selected, and loss function as the likelihood loss of ground truth based on Plackett-Luce model, which can naturally model the sequential generation of a diverse ranking list. Stochastic gradient descent is then employed to conduct the unconstrained optimization, and the prediction of a diverse ranking list is provided by a sequential selection process based on the learned ranking function. The experimental results on the public TREC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.},

Along with the quick expansion of social media, reuses of local text are occurring much more frequently than ever before. The task of detecting these local reuses serves as an essential step for many applications. It has attracted extensive attention in recent years. However, semantic level similarities have not received consideration in most previous works. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to efficiently detect local reuses at the semantic level for large scale problems. We propose to use continuous vector representations of words to capture the semantic level similarities between short text segments. In order to handle tens of billions of documents, methods based on information geometry and hashing methods are introduced to aggregate and map text segments presented by word embeddings to binary hash codes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve significantly better performance than state-of-the-art approaches in all six document collections belonging to four different categories. At some recall levels, the precisions of the proposed method are even 10 times higher than previous methods. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed method is comparable to or better than that of some other hashing methods.},

 abstract = {The aim of risk-sensitive evaluation is to measure when a given information retrieval (IR) system does not perform worse than a corresponding baseline system for any topic. This paper argues that risk-sensitive evaluation is akin to the underlying methodology of the Student's t test for matched pairs. Hence, we introduce a risk-reward tradeoff measure TRisk that generalises the existing URisk measure (as used in the TREC 2013 Web track's risk-sensitive task) while being theoretically grounded in statistical hypothesis testing and easily interpretable. In particular, we show that TRisk is a linear transformation of the t statistic, which is the test statistic used in the Student's t test. This inherent relationship between TRisk and the t statistic, turns risk-sensitive evaluation from a descriptive analysis to a fully-fledged inferential analysis. Specifically, we demonstrate using past TREC data, that by using the inferential analysis techniques introduced in this paper, we can (1) decide whether an observed level of risk for an IR system is statistically significant, and thereby infer whether the system exhibits a real risk, and (2) determine the topics that individually lead to a significant level of risk. Indeed, we show that the latter permits a state-of-the-art learning to rank algorithm (LambdaMART) to focus on those topics in order to learn effective yet risk-averse ranking systems.},

 abstract = {Influence maximization, fundamental for word-of-mouth marketing and viral marketing, aims to find a set of seed nodes maximizing influence spread on social network. Early methods mainly fall into two paradigms with certain benefits and drawbacks: (1) Greedy algorithms, selecting seed nodes one by one, give a guaranteed accuracy relying on the accurate approximation of influence spread with high computational cost; (2) Heuristic algorithms, estimating influence spread using efficient heuristics, have low computational cost but unstable accuracy. We first point out that greedy algorithms are essentially finding a self-consistent ranking, where nodes' ranks are consistent with their ranking-based marginal influence spread. This insight motivates us to develop an iterative ranking framework, i.e., IMRank, to efficiently solve influence maximization problem under independent cascade model. Starting from an initial ranking, e.g., one obtained from efficient heuristic algorithm, IMRank finds a self-consistent ranking by reordering nodes iteratively in terms of their ranking-based marginal influence spread computed according to current ranking. We also prove that IMRank definitely converges to a self-consistent ranking starting from any initial ranking. Furthermore, within this framework, a last-to-first allocating strategy and a generalization of this strategy are proposed to improve the efficiency of estimating ranking-based marginal influence spread for a given ranking. In this way, IMRank achieves both remarkable efficiency and high accuracy by leveraging simultaneously the benefits of greedy algorithms and heuristic algorithms. As demonstrated by extensive experiments on large scale real-world social networks, IMRank always achieves high accuracy comparable to greedy algorithms, while the computational cost is reduced dramatically, about 10-100 times faster than other scalable heuristics.},

In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of user interactions with auto-completion based on query logs of Bing, a commercial search engine. Our results confirm that lower-ranked auto-completion suggestions receive substantially lower engagement than those ranked higher. We also observe that users are most likely to engage with auto-completion after typing about half of the query, and in particular at word boundaries. Interestingly, we also noticed that the likelihood of using auto-completion varies with the distance of query characters on the keyboard.  Overall, we believe that the results reported in our study provide valuable insights for understanding user engagement with auto-completion, and are likely to inform the design of more effective QAC systems.},

Evaluation performed with the INEX entity ranking track collections shows that our predictor can often outperform the most effective predictors we experimented with.},

 abstract = {Information retrieval test collections traditionally use a combination of automatic and manual runs to create a pool of documents to be judged. The quality of the final judgments produced for a collection is a product of the variety across each of the runs submitted and the pool depth. In this work, we explore fully automated approaches to generating a pool. By combining a simple voting approach with machine learning from documents retrieved by automatic runs, we are able to identify a large portion of relevant documents that would normally only be found through manual runs. Our initial results are promising and can be extended in future studies to help test collection curators ensure proper judgment coverage is maintained across complete document collections.},

Twenty years ago, there were fewer than 3k web sites and the earliest web search engines indexed approximately 50k pages. Today, search engines index billions of web pages, images, videos, news, music, social media, books, etc., and have become the main entry point for a wide range of information, services, communications and entertainment. Despite these tremendous accomplishments, we still have a long way to go. Many searches are unsuccessful, and even those that succeed are often harder than they should be. To address these challenges we need to extend our evaluation methods to handle the diversity of searchers, tasks, and interactivity that characterize information systems today. I will discuss recent work on user modeling and temporal dynamics of information systems to illustrate the power of utilizing converging lines of evidence from laboratory, panel, and large-scale log techniques to understand and support searchers.},

In a real-world deployment spanning over two months, results show that SearchPanel appears to have been primarily used for complex information needs, in search sessions with long durations and high numbers of queries.

Since posts are short and noisy, it is hard to extract reliable events based on word frequency. Even though an event term appears in a particularly low frequency, as long as at least one reliable user mentions the term, it should be extracted. This paper proposes an event extraction method which combines user reliability and timeline analysis. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is adapted with the weights of event terms on timeline and reliable users to extract social events. The reliable users are detected on Twitter according to their tweeting behaviors: socially well-known users and active users. Reliable and low-frequency events can be detected based on reliable users In order to see the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a Korean tweet collection; the proposed model achieved 72% in precision. This shows that the LDA with timeline and reliable users is effective for extracting events on the Twitter test collection.},

 abstract = {Searching for scenes in team sport videos is a task that recurs very often in game analysis and other related activities performed by coaches. In most cases, queries are formulated on the basis of specific motion characteristics the user remembers from the video. Providing sketching interfaces for graphically specifying query input is thus a very natural user interaction for a retrieval application. However, the quality of the query (the sketch) heavily depends on the memory of the user and her ability to accurately formulate the intended search query by transforming this 3D memory of the known item(s) into a 2D sketch query. In this paper, we present an auto-suggest search feature that harnesses spatiotemporal data of team sport videos to suggest potential directions containing relevant data during the formulation of a sketch-based motion query. Users can intuitively select the direction of the desired motion query on-the-fly using the displayed visual clues, thus relaxing the need for relying heavily on memory to formulate the query. At the same time, this significantly enhances the accuracy of the results and the speed at which they appear. A first evaluation has shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of exploiting the context to learn user reformulation behavior for boosting prediction performance. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of how the users reformulate their queries. Based on the analysis, we propose a supervised approach to query auto-completion, where three kinds of reformulation-related features are considered, including term-level, query-level and session-level features. These features carefully capture how the users change preceding queries along the query sessions. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the large-scale query log of a commercial search engine.

 abstract = {Recommender systems usually need to compare a large number of items before users' most preferred ones can be found This process can be very costly if recommendations are frequently made on large scale datasets. In this paper, a novel hashing algorithm, named Preference Preserving Hashing (PPH), is proposed to speed up recommendation. Hashing has been widely utilized in large scale similarity search (e.g. similar image search), and the search speed with binary hashing code is significantly faster than that with real-valued features. However, one challenge of applying hashing to recommendation is that, recommendation concerns users' preferences over items rather than their similarities. To address this challenge, PPH contains two novel components that work with the popular matrix factorization (MF) algorithm. In MF, users' preferences over items are calculated as the inner product between the learned real-valued user/item features. The first component of PPH constrains the learning process, so that users' preferences can be well approximated by user-item similarities. The second component, which is a novel quantization algorithm,generates the binary hashing code from the learned real-valued user/item features. Finally, recommendation can be achieved efficiently via fast hashing code search. Experiments on three real world datasets show that the recommendation speed of the proposed PPH algorithm can be hundreds of times faster than original MF with real-valued features, and the recommendation accuracy is significantly better than previous work of hashing for recommendation.},

QPP is especially interesting in the context of Automatic Query Expansion (AQE) based on Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF). PRF-based AQE is known to produce unreliable results when the initial set of retrieved documents is poor. Theoretically, a good predictor would allow to selectively apply PRF-based AQE when performance of the initial result set is good enough, thus enhancing the overall robustness of the system. QPP would be of great benefit in the context of microblog retrieval, as AQE was the most widely deployed technique for enhancing retrieval performance at TREC.

 abstract = {Supervised text classifiers require extensive human expertise and labeling efforts. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised text classification algorithm based on the labeling of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topics. Our algorithm is based on the generative property of LDA. In our algorithm, we ask an annotator to assign one or more class labels to each topic, based on its most probable words. We classify a document based on its posterior topic proportions and the class labels of the topics. We also enhance our approach by incorporating domain knowledge in the form of labeled words. We evaluate our approach on four real world text classification datasets. The results show that our approach is more accurate in comparison to semi-supervised techniques from previous work. A central contribution of this work is an approach that delivers effectiveness comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised techniques in hard-to-classify domains, with very low overheads in terms of manual knowledge engineering.},

 abstract = {Web Search has seen two big changes recently: rapid growth in mobile search traffic, and an increasing trend towards providing answer-like results for relatively simple information needs (e.g., [weather today]). Such results display the answer or relevant information on the search page itself without requiring a user to click. While clicks on organic search results have been used extensively to infer result relevance and search satisfaction, clicks on answer-like results are often rare (or meaningless), making it challenging to evaluate answer quality. Together, these call for better measurement and understanding of search satisfaction on mobile devices. In this paper, we studied whether tracking the browser viewport (visible portion of a web page) on mobile phones could enable accurate measurement of user attention at scale, and provide good measurement of search satisfaction in the absence of clicks. Focusing on answer-like results in web search, we designed a lab study to systematically vary answer presence and relevance (to the user's information need), obtained satisfaction ratings from users, and simultaneously recorded eye gaze and viewport data as users performed search tasks. Using this ground truth, we identified increased scrolling past answer and increased time below answer as clear, measurable signals of user dissatisfaction with answers. While the viewport may contain three to four results at any given time, we found strong correlations between gaze duration and viewport duration on a per result basis, and that the average user attention is focused on the top half of the phone screen, suggesting that we may be able to scalably and reliably identify which specific result the user is looking at, from viewport data alone.},

 abstract = {As the scale of available on-line data grows ever larger, individuals and businesses must cope with increasing complexity in decision-making processes which utilize large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured and/or structured data to satisfy multiple, interrelated information needs which contribute to an overall decision. Traditional decision support systems (DSSs) have been developed to address this need, but such systems are typically expensive to build, and are purpose-built for a particular decision-making scenario, making them difficult to extend or adapt to new decision scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel decision representation which allows decision makers to formulate and organize natural language questions or assertions into an analytic hierarchy, which can be evaluated as part of an ad hoc decision process or as a documented, repeatable analytic process. We then introduce a new decision support framework, QUADS, which takes advantage of automatic question answering (QA) technologies to automatically understand and process a decision representation, producing a final decision by gathering and weighting answers to individual questions using a Bayesian learning and inference process. An open source framework implementation is presented and applied to two real world applications: target validation, a fundamental decision-making task for the pharmaceutical industry, and product recommendation from review texts, an everyday decision-making situation faced by on-line consumers. In both applications, we implemented and compared a number of decision synthesis algorithms, and present experimental results which demonstrate the performance of the QUADS approach versus other baseline approaches.},

While these studies enabled better understanding of search result examination, their findings might not generalize for the tasks and search interfaces in other domains such as Shopping or Social Media. In this paper we present, to best of our knowledge, the first cross-domain comparison of search examination behavior and patterns of aggregated attention across Web Search, News, Shopping and Social Network domains. We investigate how domain of the search and the scope of the information need affect search examination, and find significant differences beyond those arising from natural disparities between individuals. For example, we find that the mean fixation duration, a common indicator of cognitive load, varies significantly across domains (e.g., mean fixation duration in the Social Network domain exceeds that of general Web Search by over 30%). We also find large differences in the aggregate patterns of user attention on the screen, especially in the Shopping and Social Network domains compared to the Web Search domain, emphasizing the need for domain specific user models and evaluation metrics.},

This problem effects authors and reviewers of submissions to academic journals and conferences, who must be able to identify which portions of an article are novel and which are not. Therefore, having a process to automatically judge the flow of novelty though a document would assist academics in their quest for truth. In this article, we propose the concept of Within Document Novelty Location, a method of identifying locations of novelty and non-novelty within a given document. In this preliminary investigation, we examine if a second order statistical model has any benefit, in terms of accuracy and confidence, over a simpler first order model. Experiments on 928 text sequences taken from three academic articles showed that the second order model provided a significant increase in novelty location accuracy for two of the three documents. There was no significant difference in accuracy for the remaining document, which is likely to be due to the absence of context analysis.},

The control summary style used Google's regular hit formatting where expressions are presented as text (e.g. in LaTeX), while the second summary style renders the math expressions. Participants were undergraduate and graduate students. Participants in the rendered summary style (n=19) had on average a 17.18% higher assessment accuracy than those in the non-rendered summary style (n=19), with no significant difference in response times. Participants in the rendered condition reported having fewer problems reading hits than participants in the control condition.

We demonstrate the ability of our model to learn relations between cross-idiomatic topics in a dataset containing product descriptions and reviews. We intrinsically evaluate our model by the perplexity measure. Following that, as an extrinsic evaluation, we present the utility of the new MiLDA topic model in a recently proposed IR task of linking Pinterest pins (given in colloquial English on the users' side) to online webshops (given in formal English on the retailers' side). We show that our multi-idiomatic model outperforms the standard monolingual LDA model and the pure bilingual LDA model both in terms of perplexity and MAP scores in the IR task.},

Due to this multi-modal distribution of behaviors, it is non-trivial to automatically discern which behaviors are business-relevant and which are not. Additionally, it is difficult to infer communities of interest within the enterprise, even given an organizational mapping. In this work, we present a two-step framework for classifying user behavior within an enterprise in a data-driven way. As a first step, we use a latent topic model on active search queries to identify types of behaviors and topics of interest associated with a given user. We then leverage the information about user's assigned role within the organization to extract relevant topics which are most reflective of self-organizing communities of interest. We demonstrate that our framework is able to identify rich communities of interest that are better representations of how users interact and assemble in an enterprise setting.},

Such content creates a monolingual or cross-lingual space with more than one scripts which is referred as mixed-script space and information retrieval in this space is referred as mixed-script information retrieval (MSIR) [1]. In mixed-script space, the documents and queries may either be in the native script and/or the Roman transliterated script for a language (mono-lingual scenario). There can be further extension of MSIR such as multi-lingual MSIR in which terms can be in multiple scripts in multiple languages. Since there are no standard ways of spelling a word in a non-native script, transliteration content almost always features extensive spelling variations. This phenomenon presents a non-trivial term matching problem for search engines to match the native-script or Roman-transliterated query with the documents in multiple scripts taking into account the spelling variations. This problem, although prevalent inWeb search for users of many languages around the world, has received very little attention till date. Very recently we have formally defined the problem of MSIR and presented the quantitative study on it through Bing query log analysis.},

These approaches are usually expensive to execute, and sometimes are not able to capture the most recent hazards. Moreover, they often only focus on major highways due to a lack of sufficient manpower. Consequently, many hazards on minor roads get ignored, which may pose serious dangers to drivers. In this paper, we demonstrate an application of Twitter to atomically determining road hazards. By building language models based on Twitter users' online communication, our system aims at pinpointing potential road hazards that pose driving risks. The likelihood of poor driving conditions can then be exposed via map overlays to warn drivers about potentially dangerous driving conditions in their locale or on current routes, thereby significantly reducing the chances of an accident occurring. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the utility of social media to automatically detect road hazards. We conduct experiments on a testbed of tweets discussing road conditions and the initial results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

However tools and interfaces have lagged behind users' expectations, with current tools making it difficult to discover new events and failing to provide a solution to the problem of information overload. We have developed an interactive interface for visualizing events, backed by a state-of-the-art event detection approach, which is able to detect, track and summarize events in real-time. Our interface provides up-to-the-second information about ongoing events in an easy to understand manner, including category information, temporal distribution, and location information -- all of which was previously unobtainable in real-time.},

 abstract = {Unlike in general recommendation scenarios where a user has only a single role, users in trust rating network, e.g. Epinions, are associated with two different roles simultaneously: as a truster and as a trustee. With different roles, users can show distinct preferences for rating items, which the previous approaches do not involve. Moreover, based on explicit single links between two users, existing methods can not capture the implicit correlation between two users who are similar but not socially connected. In this paper, we propose to learn dual role preferences (truster/trustee-specific preferences) for trust-aware recommendation by modeling explicit interactions (e.g., rating and trust) and implicit interactions. In particular, local links structure of trust network are exploited as two regularization terms to capture the implicit user correlation, in terms of truster/trustee-specific preferences. Using a real-world and open dataset, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study to investigate the performance of the proposed model, RoRec. The results show that RoRec outperforms other trust-aware recommendation approaches, in terms of prediction accuracy.},

 abstract = {The vast amount of real-time and social content in microblogs results in an information overload for users when searching microblog data. Given the user's search query, delivering content that is relevant to her interests is a challenging problem. Traditional methods for personalized Web search are insufficient in the microblog domain, because of the diversity of topics, sparseness of user data and the highly social nature. In particular, social interactions between users need to be considered, in order to accurately model user's interests, alleviate data sparseness and tackle the cold-start problem. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel framework for Collaborative Personalized Twitter Search. At its core, we develop a collaborative user model, which exploits the user's social connections in order to obtain a comprehensive account of her preferences. We then propose a novel user model structure to manage the topical diversity in Twitter and to enable semantic-aware query disambiguation. Our framework integrates a variety of information about the user's preferences in a principled manner. A thorough evaluation is conducted using two personalized Twitter search query logs, demonstrating a superior ranking performance of our framework compared with state-of-the-art baselines.},

Two representations are created: the sequences of page use and a cognitive representation of page interactions. The cognitive representation is based on logged eye movement patterns of textual information acquisition via the reading process. Page sequence actions from task sessions (n=109) in a user study are analyzed. The study tasks differed from one another in basic dimensions of complexity, specificity,level, and the type of information product (intellectual or factual). The results show that differences in task types can be measured at both the level of observations of page type sequences and at the level of cognitive activity on the pages. We discuss the implications for personalization of search systems, measurement of task similarity and the development of user-centered information systems that can support the user's current and expected search intentions.},

However, customer reviews grow exponentially while varying greatly in quality. It is generally very tedious and difficult, if not impossible, for users to read though the huge amount of review data. Fortunately, review quality evaluation enables a system to select the most helpful reviews for users' decision-making. Previous studies predict only the overall review utility about a product, and often focus on developing different data features to learn a quality function for addressing the problem. In this paper, we aim to select the most helpful reviews not only at the product level, but also at a fine-grained product aspect level. We propose a novel supervised joint aspect and sentiment model (SJASM), which is a probabilistic topic modeling framework that jointly discovers aspects and sentiments guided by a review helpfulness metric. One key advantage of SJASM is its ability to infer the underlying aspects and sentiments, which are indicative of the helpfulness of a review. We validate SJASM using publicly available review data, and our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SJASM over several competing models.},

Traditional hashing methods try to learn the hash codes in an unsupervised way where the metric (Euclidean) structure of the training data is preserved. Very recently, supervised hashing methods, which try to preserve the semantic structure constructed from the semantic labels of the training points, have exhibited higher accuracy than unsupervised methods. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised hashing method, called latent factor hashing(LFH), to learn similarity-preserving binary codes based on latent factor models. An algorithm with convergence guarantee is proposed to learn the parameters of LFH. Furthermore, a linear-time variant with stochastic learning is proposed for training LFH on large-scale datasets. Experimental results on two large datasets with semantic labels show that LFH can achieve superior accuracy than state-of-the-art methods with comparable training time.},

However, in domains such as mobile apps, a version update may provide substantial changes to an app as updates, reflected by an increment in its version number, may attract a consumer's interest for a previously unappealing version. Version descriptions constitute an important recommendation evidence source as well as a basis for understanding the rationale for a recommendation. We present a novel framework that incorporates features distilled from version descriptions into app recommendation. We use a semi-supervised topic model to construct a representation of an app's version as a set of latent topics from version metadata and textual descriptions. We then discriminate the topics based on genre information and weight them on a per-user basis to generate a version-sensitive ranked list of apps for a target user. Incorporating our version features with state-of-the-art individual and hybrid recommendation techniques significantly improves recommendation quality. An important advantage of our method is that it targets particular versions of apps, allowing previously disfavored apps to be recommended when user-relevant features are added.},

Although a partition-based approach accelerates this process by simplifying parallelism management and avoiding unnecessary I/O and comparison, it is still challenging to balance the computation load among parallel machines with a distributed architecture.

We analyze the optimality and competitiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrates its effectiveness using several datasets. We also describe a static partitioning algorithm to even out the partition sizes while detecting more dissimilar pairs.

For instance, computing the number of page clicks, number of queries, or dwell time on a search result. In a recent paper, Dupret and Lalmas introduced a new metric called absence time, which uses the time interval between successive sessions of users to measure their satisfaction with the system. They evaluated this metric on a version of Yahoo! Answers. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of absence time in evaluating new features in a web search engine, such as new ranking algorithm or a new user interface. We measured the variation of absence time to the effects of 21 experiments performed on a search engine. Our findings show that the outcomes of absence time agreed with the judgement of human experts performing a thorough analysis of a wide range of online and offline metrics in 14 out of these 21 cases. We also investigated the relationship between absence time and a set of commonly-used covariates (features) such as the number of queries and clicks in the session. Our results suggest that users are likely to return to the search engine sooner when their previous session has more queries and more clicks.},

 abstract = {We consider a scenario where a searcher requires both high precision and high recall from an interactive retrieval process. Such scenarios are very common in real life, exemplified by medical search, legal search, market research, and literature review. When access to the entire data set is available, an active learning loop could be used to ask for additional relevance feedback labels in order to refine a classifier. When data is accessed via search services, however, only limited subsets of the corpus can be considered, subsets defined by queries. In that setting, relevance feedback has been used in a query enhancement loop that updates a query. We describe and demonstrate the effectiveness of ReQ-ReC (ReQuery-ReClassify), a double-loop retrieval system that combines iterative expansion of a query set with iterative refinements of a classifier. This permits a separation of concerns, where the query selector's job is to enhance recall while the classifier's job is to maximize precision on the items that have been retrieved by any of the queries so far. The overall process alternates between the query enhancement loop, to increase recall, and the classifier refinement loop, to increase precision. The separation allows the query enhancement process to explore larger parts of the query space. Our experiments show that this distribution of work significantly outperforms previous relevance feedback methods that rely on a single ranking function to balance precision and recall.},

 abstract = {In many online news services, users often write comments towards news in subjective emotions such as sadness, happiness or anger. Knowing such emotions can help understand the preferences and perspectives of individual users, and therefore may facilitate online publishers to provide more relevant services to users. Although building emotion classifiers is a practical task, it highly depends on sufficient training data that is not easy to be collected directly and the manually labeling work of comments can be quite labor intensive. Also, online news has different domains, which makes the problem even harder as different word distributions of the domains require different classifiers with corresponding distinct training data. This paper addresses the task of emotion tagging for comments of cross-domain online news. The cross-domain task is formulated as a transfer learning problem which utilizes a small amount of labeled data from a target news domain and abundant labeled data from a different source domain. This paper proposes a novel framework to transfer knowledge across different news domains. More specifically, different approaches have been proposed when the two domains share the same set of emotion categories or use different categories. An extensive set of experimental results on four datasets from popular online news services demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed models in cross-domain emotion tagging for comments of online news in both the scenarios of sharing the same emotion categories or having different categories in the source and target domains.},

Proportions carry only relative information and are not free to vary independently of one another: for the proportion of one term to increase, one or more others must decrease. These constraints are hallmarks of compositional data. While there has long been discussion in other fields of how such data should be analysed, to our knowledge, Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) has not been considered in IR. In this work we explore compositional data in IR through the lens of distance measures, and demonstrate that common measures, naive to compositions, have some undesirable properties which can be avoided with composition-aware measures.

 abstract = {A large number of mainstream applications, like temporal search, event detection, and trend identification, assume knowledge of the timestamp of every document in a given textual collection. In many cases, however, the required timestamps are either unavailable or ambiguous. A charac- teristic instance of this problem emerges in the context of large repositories of old digitized documents. For such doc- uments, the timestamp may be corrupted during the digiti- zation process, or may simply be unavailable. In this paper, we study the task of approximating the timestamp of a doc- ument, so-called document dating. We propose a content- based method and use recent advances in the domain of term burstiness, which allow it to overcome the drawbacks of pre- vious document dating methods, e.g. the fix time partition strategy. We use an extensive experimental evaluation on different datasets to validate the efficacy and advantages of our methodology, showing that our method outperforms the state of the art methods on document dating.},

However the increasingly large amount of publications makes it difficult for researchers to effectively discover the most important previous works to the topic of their research. In this paper, we study the automatic discovery of the core papers for a research area. We propose a collective topic model on three types of objects: papers, authors and published venues. We model any of these objects as bags of citations. Based on Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), authorship, published venues and citation relations are used for quantifying paper importance. Our method discusses milestone paper discovery in different cases of input objects.

 abstract = {Social tags are known to be a valuable source of information for image retrieval and organization. However, contrary to the conventional document retrieval, rich tag frequency information in social sharing systems, such as Flickr, is not available, thus we cannot directly use the tag frequency (analogous to the term frequency in a document) to represent the relevance of tags. Many heuristic approaches have been proposed to address this problem, among which the well-known neighbor voting based approaches are the most effective methods. The basic assumption of these methods is that a tag is considered as relevant to the visual content of a target image if this tag is also used to annotate the visual neighbor images of the target image by lots of different users. The main limitation of these approaches is that they treat the voting power of each neighbor image either equally or simply based on its visual similarity. In this paper, we cast the social tag relevance learning problem as an adaptive teleportation random walk process on the voting graph. In particular, we model the relationships among images by constructing a voting graph, and then propose an adaptive teleportation random walk, in which a confidence factor is introduced to control the teleportation probability, on the voting graph. Through this process, direct and indirect relationships among images can be explored to cooperatively estimate the tag relevance. To quantify the performance of our approach, we compare it with state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets (NUS-WIDE and MIR Flickr). The results indicate that our method achieves substantial performance gains on these datasets.},

For example, annotations of entities from large general purpose knowledge bases, such as Freebase and the Google Knowledge Graph. Understanding how to leverage these entity annotations of text to improve ad hoc document retrieval is an open research area. Query expansion is a commonly used technique to improve retrieval effectiveness. Most previous query expansion approaches focus on text, mainly using unigram concepts. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called entity query feature expansion (EQFE) which enriches the query with features from entities and their links to knowledge bases, including structured attributes and text. We experiment using both explicit query entity annotations and latent entities. We evaluate our technique on TREC text collections automatically annotated with knowledge base entity links, including the Google Freebase Annotations (FACC1) data. We find that entity-based feature expansion results in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art text expansion approaches.},

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to characterize how people change or stick with their expertise. Specifically, three factors are taken into consideration in whether an expert will choose a new expertise area: 1) the personality of the expert in exploring new areas; 2) the similarity between the new area and the expert's current areas; 3) the popularity of the new area. These three factors are integrated into a unified generative process. A predictive language model is derived to estimate the distribution of the expert's words in her future publications. In addition, KL divergence is defined on the predictive language model to quantify and forecast the change of expertise. We conduct the experiments on a testbed of academic publications and the initial results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {Abstract Using a novel evaluation toolkit that simulates a human reviewer in the loop, we compare the effectiveness of three machine-learning protocols for technology-assisted review as used in document review for discovery in legal proceedings. Our comparison addresses a central question in the deployment of technology-assisted review: Should training documents be selected at random, or should they be selected using one or more non-random methods, such as keyword search or active learning? On eight review tasks -- four derived from the TREC 2009 Legal Track and four derived from actual legal matters -- recall was measured as a function of human review effort. The results show that entirely non-random training methods, in which the initial training documents are selected using a simple keyword search, and subsequent training documents are selected by active learning, require substantially and significantly less human review effort (P<0.01) to achieve any given level of recall, than passive learning, in which the machine-learning algorithm plays no role in the selection of training documents. Among passive-learning methods, significantly less human review effort (P<0.01) is required when keywords are used instead of random sampling to select the initial training documents. Among active-learning methods, continuous active learning with relevance feedback yields generally superior results to simple active learning with uncertainty sampling, while avoiding the vexing issue of "stabilization" -- determining when training is adequate, and therefore may stop.},

Amazingly, SIGIR 2015 is not only held in my hometown, but also where I did my high school studies. Could I ever imagine that? No way! So in this venue where I have plenty of mixed memories, we start the conference on Sunday with eight great tutorials, thanks to Yoelle Maarek; the Doctoral Consortium, organized by J. Shane Culpepper and Brian Davidson; and we finish the day with the opening reception in the central patio. The next three days we have the core of the conference, highlighted with the keynotes by Nick Belkin, (Salton Award) on how we interact with information, and ChengXiang Zhai on game theory applied to IR. We also have 70 technical papers selected by the program committee chaired by Mounia Lalmas, Alistair Moffat and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto. Thanks for your great and hard work! We also have 79 short papers and 12 demos presented in a special session before the banquet on Tuesday that will be held at a nearby palace on Cerro Santa Lucía. Thanks to Maarten de Rijke, Ee-Peng Lim and Ryen White for handling the short papers and Djoerd Hiemstra and Mirella Moro for arranging the demonstrations. On Wednesday we also have the industry track, SIRIP, organized by Hang Li and Jaime Teevan. This track combines eight invited talks and four refereed papers. This day we have been able to keep the number of parallel tracks to just three, and also have the final panel on industry impact from academia, as a single track event. Finally, on Thursday we have seven interesting workshops, thanks to the committee chaired by Fernando Diaz and Diane Kelly.},

 abstract = {Context-aware recommendation (CAR) can lead to significant improvements in the relevance of the recommended items by modeling the nuanced ways in which context influences preferences. The dominant approach in context-aware recommendation has been the multidimensional latent factors approach in which users, items, and context variables are represented as latent features in low-dimensional space. An interaction between a user, item, and a context variable is typically modeled as some linear combination of their latent features. However, given the many possible types of interactions between user, items and contextual variables, it may seem unrealistic to restrict the interactions among them to linearity. To address this limitation, we develop a novel and powerful non-linear probabilistic algorithm for context-aware recommendation using Gaussian processes. The method which we call Gaussian Process Factorization Machines (GPFM) is applicable to both the explicit feedback setting (e.g. numerical ratings as in the Netflix dataset) and the implicit feedback setting (i.e. purchases, clicks). We derive stochastic gradient descent optimization to allow scalability of the model. We test GPFM on five different benchmark contextual datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GPFM outperforms state-of-the-art context-aware recommendation methods.},

Understanding it is critical for search providers to evaluate the performance and improve the effectiveness of search engines. Existing methods model search satisfaction holistically at the search-task level, ignoring important dependencies between action-level satisfaction and overall task satisfaction. We hypothesize that searchers' latent action-level satisfaction (i.e., whether they believe they were satisfied with the results of a query or click) influences their observed search behaviors and contributes to overall search satisfaction. We conjecture that by modeling search satisfaction at the action level, we can build more complete and more accurate predictors of search-task satisfaction. To do this, we develop a latent structural learning method, whereby rich structured features and dependency relations unique to search satisfaction prediction are explored. Using in-situ search satisfaction judgments provided by searchers, we show that there is significant value in modeling action-level satisfaction in search-task satisfaction prediction. In addition, experimental results on large-scale logs from Bing.com demonstrate clear benefit from using inferred action satisfaction labels for other applications such as document relevance estimation and query suggestion.},

Continuous-time MP behaves like time-calibrated measures, bringing the time spent by the user into the evaluation of a system; discrete-time MP behaves like traditional evaluation measures. Being part of the same Markovian framework, the time-based and rank-based versions of MP produce values that are directly comparable. We show that it is possible to re-create average precision using specific user models and this helps in providing an explanation of Average Precision (AP) in terms of user models more realistic than the ones currently used to justify it. We also propose several alternative models that take into account different possible behaviors in scanning a ranked result list.

Existing summarization systems do not consider whether a sentence in news articles is certain or not. In this paper, we propose a novel system called CTSUM to incorporate the new factor of information certainty into the summarization task. We first analyze the sentences in news articles and automatically predict the certainty levels of sentences by using the support vector regression method with a few useful features. The predicted certainty scores are then incorporated into a summarization system with a graph-based ranking algorithm. Experimental results on a manually labeled dataset verify the effectiveness of the sentence certainty prediction technique, and experimental results on the DUC2007 dataset shows that our new summarization system cannot only produce summaries with better content quality, but also produce summaries with higher certainty.},

For mathematical non-experts, this can lead to an "intention gap" between the query they wish to express and what the interface will allow them to express. min is a search interface that supports drawing expressions on a canvas using mouse/touch, keyboard and images. We present a user study examining whether min changes search behavior for mathematical non-experts, and to identify real-world usage scenarios for multimodal math search interfaces. Participants found query-by-expression using hand-drawn input useful, and identified scenarios in which they would like to use systems like min such as for locating, editing and sharing complex expressions (e.g., with many Greek letters), and working on complex math problems.},

 abstract = {Most existing tag-based social image search engines present search results as a ranked list of images, which cannot be consumed by users in a natural and intuitive manner. In this paper, we present a novel concept-preserving image search results summarization algorithm named Prism. Prism exploits both visual features and tags of the search results to generate high quality summary, which not only breaks the results into visually and semantically coherent clusters but it also maximizes the coverage of the summary w.r.t the original search results. It first constructs a visual similarity graph where the nodes are images in the search results and the edges represent visual similarities between pairs of images. This graph is optimally decomposed and compressed into a set of concept-preserving subgraphs based on a set of summarization objectives. Images in a concept-preserving subgraph are visually and semantically cohesive and are described by a minimal set of tags or concepts. Lastly, one or more exemplar images from each subgraph is selected to form the exemplar summary of the result set. Through empirical study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Prism against state-of-the-art image summarization and clustering algorithms.},

In either method, crawling results in more information being harvested than just the websites intended for preservation; which could be used to reconstruct impressions of pages that existed on the live web of the crawl date, but would have been lost forever. We present a method to create representations of what we will refer to as a web collection's (aura): the web documents that were not included in the archived collection, but are known to have existed --- due to their mentions on pages that were included in the archived web collection. To create representations of these unarchived pages, we exploit the information about the unarchived URLs that can be derived from the crawls by combining crawl date distribution, anchor text and link structure. We illustrate empirically that the size of the aura can be substantial: in 2012, the Dutch Web archive contained 12.3M unique pages, while we uncover references to 11.9M additional (unarchived) pages.},

Collaborative filtering which rooted from recommender system has been utilized for microblog recommendation, where social relationship information can help improve the recommendation performance. However, most of existing methods only consider the static relationship, i.e. the following relationship, which totally ignores the relationship conveyed by users' repost behaviors. To explore the effects of behavior based relationship on recommendation, we propose an Interaction Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) approach. Specifically, we first use topic model to analyze users' interactive behaviors and measure the topic-specific relationship strength, then we incorporate the relationship factor into the matrix factorization framework. Experimental results show that compared to the current popular social recommendation methods, IBCF can achieve better performance on the MAP and NDCG evaluation measures, and have better interpretability for the recommended results.},

We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by an implementation of conjunctive BM25 using two modern column stores. Experiments on a web collection show that a retrieval engine built in this manner achieves effectiveness and efficiency on par with custom-built retrieval engines, but provides many additional advantages, including cleaner query semantics, a simpler architecture, built-in support for error analysis, and the ability to exploit advances in database technology "for free".},

 abstract = {Term-Relevance Prediction from Brain Signals (TRPB) is proposed to automatically detect relevance of text information directly from brain signals. An experiment with forty participants was conducted to record neural activity of participants while providing relevance judgments to text stimuli for a given topic. High-precision scientific equipment was used to quantify neural activity across 32 electroencephalography (EEG) channels. A classifier based on a multi-view EEG feature representation showed improvement up to 17% in relevance prediction based on brain signals alone. Relevance was also associated with brain activity with significant changes in certain brain areas. Consequently, TRPB is based on changes identified in specific brain areas and does not require user-specific training or calibration. Hence, relevance predictions can be conducted for unseen content and unseen participants. As an application of TRPB we demonstrate a high-precision variant of the classifier that constructs sets of relevant terms for a given unknown topic of interest. Our research shows that detecting relevance from brain signals is possible and allows the acquisition of relevance judgments without a need to observe any other user interaction. This suggests that TRPB could be used in combination or as an alternative for conventional implicit feedback signals, such as dwell time or click-through activity.},

In this paper, aiming at providing fundamental support to the research of social recommendation problem, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the correlations between social friend relations and user interest similarities. When evaluating interest similarities without distinguishing different friends a user has, we surprisingly observe that social friend relations generally cannot represent user interest similarities. A user's average similarity on all his/her friends is even correlated with the average similarity on some other randomly selected users. However, when measuring interest similarities using a finer granularity, we find that the similarities between a user and his/her friends are actually controlled by the network structure in the friend network. Factors that affect the interest similarities include subgraph topology, connected components, number of co-friends, etc. We believe our analysis provides substantial impact for social recommendation research and will benefit ongoing research in both recommender systems and other social applications.},

Currently, spammer detection in microblogging focuses on using social networking information, but little on content analysis due to the distinct nature of microblogging messages. First, label information is hard to obtain. Second, the texts in microblogging are short and noisy. As we know, spammer detection has been extensively studied for years in various media, e.g., emails, SMS and the web. Motivated by abundant resources available in the other media, we investigate whether we can take advantage of the existing resources for spammer detection in microblogging. While people accept that texts in microblogging are different from those in other media, there is no quantitative analysis to show how different they are. In this paper, we first perform a comprehensive linguistic study to compare spam across different media. Inspired by the findings, we present an optimization formulation that enables the design of spammer detection in microblogging using knowledge from external media. We conduct experiments on real-world Twitter datasets to verify (1) whether email, SMS and web spam resources help and (2) how different media help for spammer detection in microblogging.},

Hyperlocal scenarios are important because of the increasing prevalence of smartphones and mobile search and recommendation. Users expect the system to recognize their location and provide information about their immediate surroundings. In this work we propose an algorithm for constructing hyperlocal models of places that are as small as half a city block. We show that Dynamic Location Models (DLMs) are computationally efficient, and provide better estimates of the language models of hyperlocal places than the standard method of segmenting the globe into approximately equal grid squares. We evaluate the models using a repository of 25 million geotagged public images from Flickr. We show that the indexes produced by DLMs have a larger vocabulary, and smaller average document length than their fixed grid counterparts, for indexes with an equivalent number of locations. This produces location models that are more robust to retrieval parameters, and more accurate in predicting locations in text.},

 abstract = {Cold start is one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems. In this paper we tackle the cold-start problem by proposing a context-aware semi-supervised co-training method named CSEL. Specifically, we use a factorization model to capture fine-grained user-item context. Then, in order to build a model that is able to boost the recommendation performance by leveraging the context, we propose a semi-supervised ensemble learning algorithm. The algorithm constructs different (weak) prediction models using examples with different contexts and then employs the co-training strategy to allow each (weak) prediction model to learn from the other prediction models. The method has several distinguished advantages over the standard recommendation methods for addressing the cold-start problem. First, it defines a fine-grained context that is more accurate for modeling the user-item preference. Second, the method can naturally support supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, which provides a flexible way to incorporate the unlabeled data. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that with our method the recommendation accuracy is significantly improved compared to the standard algorithms and the cold-start problem is largely alleviated.},

@inproceedings{Pan:2014:CCL:2600428.2609568,
 abstract = {One of the fundamental problems in image search is to rank image documents according to a given textual query. Existing search engines highly depend on surrounding texts for ranking images, or leverage the query-image pairs annotated by human labelers to train a series of ranking functions. However, there are two major limitations: 1) the surrounding texts are often noisy or too few to accurately describe the image content, and 2) the human annotations are resourcefully expensive and thus cannot be scaled up. We demonstrate in this paper that the above two fundamental challenges can be mitigated by jointly exploring the cross-view learning and the use of click-through data. The former aims to create a latent subspace with the ability in comparing information from the original incomparable views (i.e., textual and visual views), while the latter explores the largely available and freely accessible click-through data (i.e., ``crowdsourced" human intelligence) for understanding query. Specifically, we propose a novel cross-view learning method for image search, named Click-through-based Cross-view Learning (CCL), by jointly minimizing the distance between the mappings of query and image in the latent subspace and preserving the inherent structure in each original space. On a large-scale click-based image dataset, CCL achieves the improvement over Support Vector Machine-based method by 4.0\% in terms of relevance, while reducing the feature dimension by several orders of magnitude (e.g., from thousands to tens). Moreover, the experiments also demonstrate the superior performance of CCL to several state-of-the-art subspace learning techniques.},

 abstract = {Cross-media hashing, which conducts cross-media retrieval by embedding data from different modalities into a common low-dimensional Hamming space, has attracted intensive attention in recent years. The existing cross-media hashing approaches only aim at learning hash functions to preserve the intra-modality and inter-modality correlations, but do not directly capture the underlying semantic information of the multi-modal data. We propose a discriminative coupled dictionary hashing (DCDH) method in this paper. In DCDH, the coupled dictionary for each modality is learned with side information (e.g., categories). As a result, the coupled dictionaries not only preserve the intra-similarity and inter-correlation among multi-modal data, but also contain dictionary atoms that are semantically discriminative (i.e., the data from the same category is reconstructed by the similar dictionary atoms). To perform fast cross-media retrieval, we learn hash functions which map data from the dictionary space to a low-dimensional Hamming space. Besides, we conjecture that a balanced representation is crucial in cross-media retrieval. We introduce multi-view features on the relatively ``weak'' modalities into DCDH and extend it to multi-view DCDH (MV-DCDH) in order to enhance their representation capability. The experiments on two real-world data sets show that our DCDH and MV-DCDH outperform the state-of-the-art methods significantly on cross-media retrieval.},

We extend each short document in social text streams to a more comprehensive representation via state-of-the-art entity linking and sentence ranking strategies. From documents extended in this manner, we infer dynamic probabilistic distributions over topics by dividing topics into dynamic "global" topics and "local" topics. For the third and final phase we propose a chunk-based structural optimization strategy to classify each document into multiple classes.

We take the output of a set of rankers, optimized for diversity or not, and find that data fusion can significantly improve state-of-the art diversification methods. We also introduce a new data fusion method, called diversified data fusion, which infers latent topics of a query using topic modeling, without leveraging outside information.

 abstract = {We address the problem of retrieving chess game positions similar to a given query position from a collection of archived chess games. We investigate this problem from an information retrieval (IR) perspective. The advantage of our proposed IR-based approach is that it allows using the standard inverted organization of stored chess positions, leading to an efficient retrieval. Moreover, in contrast to retrieving exactly identical board positions, the IR-based approach is able to provide approximate search functionality. In order to define the similarity between two chess board positions, we encode each game state with a textual representation. This textual encoding is designed to represent the position, reachability and the connectivity between chess pieces. Due to the absence of a standard IR dataset that can be used for this search task, a new evaluation benchmark dataset was constructed comprising of documents (chess positions) from a freely available chess game archive. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our proposed method of similarity computation, which takes into account a combination of the mobility and the connectivities between the chess pieces, performs well on the search task, achieving MAP and nDCG values of 0:4233 and 0:6922 respectively.},

These interaction modes are substantially different from the user experience on desktop search. As a result, system designers have new challenges and questions around understanding the intent on these platforms. In this paper, we study the query reformulation patterns in mobile logs. We group query reformulations based on their input method into four categories; text-text, text-voice, voice-text and voice-voice. We discuss the unique characteristics of each of these groups by comparing them against each other and desktop logs. We also compare the distribution of reformulation types (e.g. adding/dropping words) against desktop logs and show that there are new classes of reformulations that are caused by errors in speech recognition. Our results suggest that users do not tend to switch between different input types (e.g. voice and text). Voice to text switches are largely caused by speech recognition errors, and text to voice switches are unlikely to be about the same intent.},

Solving this reputation monitoring problem automatically as a topic detection task is both essential--manual processing of data is either costly or prohibitive--and challenging--topics of interest for reputation monitoring are usually fine-grained and suffer from data sparsity. We focus on a solution for the problem that (i) learns a pairwise tweet similarity function from previously annotated data, using all kinds of content-based and Twitter-based features; (ii) applies a clustering algorithm on the previously learned similarity function. Our experiments indicate that (i) Twitter signals can be used to improve the topic detection process with respect to using content signals only; (ii) learning a similarity function is a flexible and efficient way of introducing supervision in the topic detection clustering process. The performance of our best system is substantially better than state-of-the-art approaches and gets close to the inter-annotator agreement rate. A detailed qualitative inspection of the data further reveals two types of topics detected by reputation experts: reputation alerts / issues (which usually spike in time) and organizational topics (which are usually stable across time).},

 abstract = {"Evaluation as a service" (EaaS) is a new methodology that enables community-wide evaluations and the construction of test collections on documents that cannot be distributed. The basic idea is that evaluation organizers provide a service API through which the evaluation task can be completed. However, this concept violates some of the premises of traditional pool-based collection building and thus calls into question the quality of the resulting test collection. In particular, the service API might restrict the diversity of runs that contribute to the pool: this might hamper innovation by researchers and lead to incomplete judgment pools that affect the reusability of the collection. This paper shows that the distinctiveness of the retrieval runs used to construct the first test collection built using EaaS, the TREC 2013 Microblog collection, is not substantially different from that of the TREC-8 ad hoc collection, a high-quality collection built using traditional pooling. Further analysis using the `leave out uniques' test suggests that pools from the Microblog 2013 collection are less complete than those from TREC-8, although both collections benefit from the presence of distinctive and effective manual runs. Although we cannot yet generalize to all EaaS implementations, our analyses reveal no obvious flaws in the test collection built using the methodology in the TREC 2013 Microblog track.},

 abstract = {Click dwell time is the amount of time that a user spends on a clicked search result. Many previous studies have shown that click dwell time is strongly correlated with result-level satisfaction and document relevance. Accurate estimates of dwell time are therefore important for applications such as search satisfaction prediction and result ranking. However, dwell time can be estimated in different ways according to the information available about the search process. For example, a result reached for the query [Garfield] may involve 145s of "server-side" dwell time (observable to the search engine) and 40s of "client-side" dwell time (observable from the browser). Since search engines can only observe server-side actions (i.e., activity on the search engine result page), server-side dwell times are estimated by measuring the time between a search result click and the next search event (click or query). Conversely, more detailed information about page dwell times can be obtained via client-side methods such as Web browser toolbars. The client-side information enables the estimation of more accurate dwell times by measuring the amount of time that a user spends on pages of interest (either the landing page, or pages on the full navigation trail). In this paper, we define three different dwell times, i.e., server-side, client-side, and trail dwell time, and examine their effectiveness for predicting click satisfaction. For this, we collect toolbar and search engine logs from real users, and provide an analysis of dwell times for improving prediction performance. Moreover, we show further improvements in predicting click-level satisfaction by combining dwell times with other query features (e.g., query clarity).},

Fur- thermore, we investigated how medically-concerned users re- spond differently to search engine result pages (SERPs) and find that their disposition for clicking on concerning pages is pronounced, potentially leading to a self-reinforcement of concern. Finally, we studied to which degree variations in the SERP impact future search and real-world health- seeking behavior and obtained some surprising results (e.g., viewing concerning pages may lead to a short-term reduction of in-world healthcare utilization).},

 abstract = {Web archives already hold together more than 534 billion files and this number continues to grow as new initiatives arise. Searching on all versions of these files acquired throughout time is challenging, since users expect as fast and precise answers from web archives as the ones provided by current web search engines. This work studies, for the first time, how to improve the search effectiveness of web archives, including the creation of novel temporal features that explore the correlation found between web document persistence and relevance. The persistence was analyzed over 14 years of web snapshots. Additionally, we propose a temporal-dependent ranking framework that exploits the variance of web characteristics over time influencing ranking models. Based on the assumption that closer periods are more likely to hold similar web characteristics, our framework learns multiple models simultaneously, each tuned for a specific period. Experimental results show significant improvements over the search effectiveness of single-models that learn from all data independently of its time. Thus, our approach represents an important step forward on the state-of-the-art IR technology usually employed in web archives.},

 abstract = {A person often uses a single search engine for very different tasks. For example, an author editing a manuscript may use the same academic search engine to find the latest work on a particular topic or to find the correct citation for a familiar article. The author's tolerance for latency and accuracy may vary according to task. However, search engines typically employ a consistent approach for processing all queries. In this paper we explore how a range of search needs and expectations can be supported within a single search system using differential search. We introduce CiteSight, a system that provides personalized citation recommendations to author groups that vary based on task. CiteSight presents cached recommendations instantaneously for online tasks (e.g., active paper writing), and refines these recommendations in the background for offline tasks (e.g., future literature review). We develop an active cache-warming process to enhance the system as the author works, and context-coupling, a technique for augment sparse citation networks. By evaluating the quality of the recommendations and collecting user feedback, we show that differential search can provide a high level of accuracy for different tasks on different time scales. We believe that differential search can be used in many situations where the user's tolerance for latency and desired response vary dramatically based on use.},

@inproceedings{Jeon:2014:PPT:2600428.2609572,
 abstract = {Web search engines are optimized to reduce the high-percentile response time to consistently provide fast responses to almost all user queries. This is a challenging task because the query workload exhibits large variability, consisting of many short-running queries and a few long-running queries that significantly impact the high-percentile response time. With modern multicore servers, parallelizing the processing of an individual query is a promising solution to reduce query execution time, but it gives limited benefits compared to sequential execution since most queries see little or no speedup when parallelized. The root of this problem is that short-running queries, which dominate the workload, do not benefit from parallelization. They incur a large parallelization overhead, taking scarce resources from long-running queries. On the other hand, parallelization substantially reduces the execution time of long-running queries with low overhead and high parallelization efficiency. Motivated by these observations, we propose a predictive parallelization framework with two parts: (1) predicting long-running queries, and (2) selectively parallelizing them. For the first part, prediction should be accurate and efficient. For accuracy, we study a comprehensive feature set covering both term features (reflecting dynamic pruning efficiency) and query features (reflecting query complexity). For efficiency, to keep overhead low, we avoid expensive features that have excessive requirements such as large memory footprints. For the second part, we use the predicted query execution time to parallelize long-running queries and process short-running queries sequentially. We implement and evaluate the predictive parallelization framework in Microsoft Bing search. Our measurements show that under moderate to heavy load, the predictive strategy reduces the 99th-percentile response time by 50% (from 200 ms to 100 ms) compared with prior approaches that parallelize all queries.},

 abstract = {Reputation analysis is naturally linked to a sentiment analysis task of the targeted entities. This analysis leverages on a sentiment lexicon that includes general sentiment words and domain specific jargon. However, in most cases target entities are themselves part of the sentiment lexicon, creating a loop from which it is difficult to infer an entity reputation. Sometimes, the entity became a reference in the domain and is vastly cited as an example of a highly reputable entity. For example, in the movies domain it is not uncommon to see reviews citing Batman or Anthony Hopkins as esteemed references. In this paper we describe an unsupervised method for performing a simultaneous-analysis of the reputation of multiple named-entities. Our method jointly extracts named entities reputation and a domain specific sentiment lexicon. The objective is two-fold: (1) named-entities are naturally ranked by our method and (2) we can build a reputation graph of the domain's named entities. This framework has immediate applications in terms of visualization or search by reputation.},

 abstract = {Collaborative Filtering(CF)-based recommendation algorithms, such as Latent Factor Models (LFM), work well in terms of prediction accuracy. However, the latent features make it difficulty to explain the recommendation results to the users. Fortunately, with the continuous growth of online user reviews, the information available for training a recommender system is no longer limited to just numerical star ratings or user/item features. By extracting explicit user opinions about various aspects of a product from the reviews, it is possible to learn more details about what aspects a user cares, which further sheds light on the possibility to make explainable recommendations. In this work, we propose the Explicit Factor Model (EFM) to generate explainable recommendations, meanwhile keep a high prediction accuracy. We first extract explicit product features (i.e. aspects) and user opinions by phrase-level sentiment analysis on user reviews, then generate both recommendations and disrecommendations according to the specific product features to the user's interests and the hidden features learned. Besides, intuitional feature-level explanations about why an item is or is not recommended are generated from the model. Offline experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our framework over competitive baseline algorithms on both rating prediction and top-K recommendation tasks. Online experiments show that the detailed explanations make the recommendations and disrecommendations more influential on user's purchasing behavior.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent to which two theories, Information Scent and Need for Cognition, explain people's search behaviors when interacting with search engine results pages (SERPs). Information Scent, the perception of the value of information sources, was manipulated by varying the number and distribution of relevant results on the first SERP. Need for Cognition (NFC), a personality trait that measures the extent to which a person enjoys cognitively effortful activities, was measured by a standardized scale. A laboratory experiment was conducted with forty-eight participants, who completed six open-ended search tasks. Results showed that while interacting with SERPs containing more relevant documents, participants examined more documents and clicked deeper in the search result list. When interacting with SERPs that contained the same number of relevant results distributed across different ranks, participants were more likely to abandon their queries when relevant documents appeared later on the SERP. With respect to NFC, participants with higher NFC paginated less frequently and paid less attention to results at lower ranks than those with lower NFC. The interaction between NFC and the number of relevant results on the SERP affected the time spent on searching and a participant's likelihood to reformulate, paginate and stop. Our findings suggest evaluating system effectiveness based on the first page of results, even for tasks that require the user to view multiple documents, and varying interface features based on NFC.},

Previous work mainly focused on studying how noise affects ranking algorithms and how to design robust ranking algorithms. In our work, we investigate what inherent characteristics make training data robust to label noise. The motivation of our work comes from an interesting observation that a same ranking algorithm may show very different sensitivities to label noise over different data sets. We thus investigate the underlying reason for this observation based on two typical kinds of learning to rank algorithms (i.e.~pairwise and listwise methods) and three different public data sets (i.e.~OHSUMED, TD2003 and MSLR-WEB10K). We find that when label noise increases in training data, it is the \emph{document pair noise ratio} (i.e.~\emph{pNoise}) rather than \emph{document noise ratio} (i.e.~\emph{dNoise}) that can well explain the performance degradation of a ranking algorithm.},

Most of the prior work has either been conceptual, observational or empirical. While this has led to numerous insights and findings regarding the interaction between users and systems, the theory has lagged behind. In this paper, we extend the recently proposed search economic theory to make the model more realistic. We then derive eight interaction based hypotheses regarding search behaviour. To validate the model, we explore whether the search behaviour of thirty-six participants from a lab based study is consistent with the theory. Our analysis shows that observed search behaviours are in line with predicted search behaviours and that it is possible to provide credible explanations for such behaviours. This work describes a concise and compact representation of search behaviour providing a strong theoretical basis for future IIR research.},

This problem needs to be addressed since current online retailers are moving beyond single category and attempting to be diversified. In this paper, we investigate the challenge problem of product recommendation in unexplored categories and discover that the price, a factor transferrable across categories, can improve the recommendation performance significantly. Through our investigation, we address four research questions progressively: 1) what is the impact of unexplored category on recommendation performance? 2) How to represent the price factor from the recommendation point of view? 3) What does price factor across categories mean to recommendation? 4) How to utilize price factor across categories for recommendation in unexplored categories? Based on a series of experiments and analysis conducted on a dataset collected from a leading E-commerce website, we discover valuable findings for the above four questions: first, unexplored categories cause performance drop by 40% relatively for current recommendation systems; second, the price factor can be represented as either a quantity for a product or a distribution for a user to improve performance; third, consumer behavior with respect to price factor across categories is complicated and needs to be carefully modeled; finally and most importantly, we propose a new method which encodes the two perspectives of the price factor. The proposed method significantly improves the recommendation performance in unexplored categories over the state-of-the-art baseline systems and shortens the performance gap by 43% relatively.},

Thus, it is not surprising that evaluation has gained a huge attention from the research community and such an interest spans almost fifty years of research [3].

The proposed solution for hashtag recommendation consists of two phases. In the first phase, we select candidate hashtags through five schemes by considering the similar tweets, the similar documents, the named entities contained in the document, and the domain of the link. In the second phase, we formulate the hashtag recommendation problem as a learning to rank problem and adopt RankSVM to aggregate and rank the candidate hashtags.

To address this problem, we propose a novel recommendation model, named Group Latent Factor Model (GLFM), which attempts to learn a factorization of latent factor space into subspaces that are shared across multiple behaviors and subspaces that are specific to each type of behaviors. Thus, the correlation and heterogeneity of multiple behaviors can be modeled by these shared and specific latent factors. Experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that our model can integrate users' multiple types of behaviors into recommendation better.},

 abstract = {Microblogs such as Twitter are important sources for spreading vital information at high speed. They also reflect the general people's reaction and opinion towards major events or stories. With information traveling so quickly, it is helpful to be able to apply unsupervised learning techniques to discover topics for information extraction and analysis. Although graphical models have been traditionally used for topic discovery in microblogs and text streams, previous work may not be as efficient because of the diverse and noisy nature of microblogs. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of the Author-Topic and the Author-Recipient-Topic model to microblogs. We extensively compare these models under different settings to an LDA baseline. Our results show that the Author-Recipient-Topic model extracts the most coherent topics establishing that joint modeling on author-recipient pairs and on the content of tweet leads to quantitatively better topic discovery. This paper also addresses the problem of topic modeling on short text by using clustering techniques. This technique helps in boosting the performance of our models. Our study reveals interesting traits about Twitter messages, users and their interactions.},

Such a structured summary which not just introduces characters in the book but also provides a high level relationship between them can be of critical importance for buyers. This task involves the following challenging novel problems: 1. automatic discovery of important characters given a book; 2. automatic social graph construction relating the discovered characters; 3. automatic summarization of text most related to each of the characters; and 4. automatic infobox extraction from such summarized text for each character. As part of this demo, we design mechanisms to address these challenges and experiment with publicly available books.},

 abstract = {Welcome to SIGIR, the 37th annual international ACM conference on research and development in Information Retrieval, the premier international conference in the area. We acknowledge all those who submitted papers to the conference and gave the program committee an opportunity to evaluate their work for potential inclusion in the program. Huge thanks are owed to the 57 Area Chairs and 244 general program committee members, who represent 31 countries and almost 200 institutions, for their dedicated work in evaluating the submissions. The conference received 387 full paper submissions (6% increase over last year) of which 82 (21%) were accepted. This constitutes a slight increase on the acceptance rate over last year. The top five countries in terms of accepted papers (taking all author affiliations of each paper equally into account) were the U.S.A. (36%), China (18%), Singapore (9%), Israel (4%), and The Netherlands (3%). The coverage of accepted papers across topics is as follows: Document Representation and Content Analysis (13%), Queries and Query Analysis (16%), Users and Interactive IR (17%), Retrieval Models and Ranking (9%), Search Engine Architectures and Scalability (8%), Filtering and Recommending (8%), Evaluation (5%), Web IR and Social Media Search (13%), IR and Structured Data (1%), Multimedia IR (5%), Other Applications (5%). As has been customary for many years, SIGIR 2014 employed a two-tier double-blind review process. At least three reviewers reviewed each paper, and then the Primary Area Chair of the paper led a discussion, based on which (s)he wrote a meta-review. The Secondary Area Chair assigned to each paper double-checked the reviews and discussion, and in some cases, provided an additional review. The PC chairs ranked the submitted papers by the meta-review score and then by the average score of the three reviewer scores, carefully examined the reviews and associated discussion. The PC chairs first identified "clear accepts" and "clear rejects". Then the undecided papers were carefully discussed in a face-to-face PC meeting held in Amsterdam, which involved all available Area Chairs. We would like to heartily thank Jaap Kamps for his assistance in organizing the Amsterdam meeting (even mindfully keeping us on track at times!), providing necessary support materials including a dinner, all of which was greatly appreciated by those who attended the meeting. The short papers track received 263 submissions (3% increase over last year) and accepted 104 of them (40% acceptance compared to 34% last year). For the second year, the short papers are four pages long. Deep thanks to Vanessa Murdock, Gabriella Pasi and Andrew Turpin, the short paper track chairs, for their very hard and sustained work in arranging and managing a thorough review process for so many papers. The tutorial track received 17 submissions, 16 of which underwent review. Seven proposals were accepted. Thanks to Falk Scholer for managing the review process which has ensured a diverse tutorial program of excellent quality. We received 11 workshop proposals, each of which was peer-reviewed by three members of the Workshops PC, and after discussion of all submissions in the Workshops PC, the final decisions were made in consultation with the PC Chairs of the technical program. A total of 7 workshops were accepted (a 64% acceptance rate). We thank Jaap Kamps and Gabriella Kazai for their efforts in producing a great set of workshops. The Demos track received 34 submissions of which 16 were accepted. Many thanks to Paul Thomas for chairing this track and providing us with an array of interesting demos to look at. The Doctoral Consortium received 11 submissions this year of which 8 were ultimately acceptances. We are grateful to Shane Culpepper and Grace Hui Yang for chairing the consortium. This year's industry event is the SIGIR Symposium on IR in Practice (SIRIP 2014) co-chaired by Isabelle Moulinier and David Hawking. Their efforts in organizing SIRIP are gratefully acknowledged. In addition to abstracts of invited talks by industry researchers, and practitioners and consumers of IR, the SIRIP 2014 proceedings include refereed research papers with a strong industry focus (four pages). The proceedings are published separately in electronic-only format. Finally, special thanks to Mounia Lalmas for chairing the panel to select the Best Paper and Best Student Paper. This year, SIGIR has the enormous honor of hosting an ACM-W Athena award lecture to be delivered by Susan Dumais. This prestigious award celebrates women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to Computer Science.},

 abstract = {Rating prediction is to predict the preference rating of a user to an item that she has not rated before. Using the business review data from Yelp, in this paper, we study business rating prediction. A business here can be a restaurant, a shopping mall or other kind of businesses. Different from most other types of items that have been studied in various recommender systems (e.g., movie, song, book), a business physically exists at a geographical location, and most businesses have geographical neighbors within walking distance. When a user visits a business, there is a good chance that she walks by its neighbors. Through data analysis, we observe that there exists weak positive correlation between a business's ratings and its neighbors' ratings, regardless of the categories of businesses. Based on this observation, we assume that a user's rating to a business is determined by both the intrinsic characteristics of the business and the extrinsic characteristics of its geographical neighbors. Using the widely adopted latent factor model for rating prediction, in our proposed solution, we use two kinds of latent factors to model a business: one for its intrinsic characteristics and the other for its extrinsic characteristics. The latter encodes the neighborhood influence of this business to its geographical neighbors. In our experiments, we show that by incorporating geographical neighborhood influences, much lower prediction error is achieved than the state-of-the-art models including Biased MF, SVD++, and Social MF. The prediction error is further reduced by incorporating influences from business category and review content.},

However, it is not clear if it helps when both relevance and diversity are both taken into consideration. In this short paper, we propose a few data fusion methods to try to improve performance when both relevance and diversity are concerned. Experiments are carried out with 3 groups of top-ranked results submitted to the TREC web diversity task.

In this work, we expand this common way by focusing on an approach that enables us to do query-specific modification of a retrieval model for learning-to-rank problems. Our approach is based on using feedback documents in two ways: 1) to improve the retrieval model directly and 2) to identify a subset of training queries that are more predictive than others. Experiments with the Gov2 collection show that this approach can obtain statistically significant improvements over two baselines; learning-to-rank (SVM-rank) with no feedback and learning-to-rank with standard relevance feedback.},

Traditionally, the expansion terms are extracted either according to the term distributions in the feedback documents; or according to both the term distributions in the feedback documents and in the whole document collection. However, most of the existing models employ a single term frequency normalization mechanism or criteria that cannot take into account various aspects of a term's saliency in the feedback documents. In this paper, we propose a simple and heuristic, but effective model, in which three term frequency transformation techniques are integrated to capture the saliency of a candidate term associated with the original query terms in the feedback documents.

Several recent work address this problem well utilizing pairwise ranking method with a fundamental assumption that a user prefers items with positive feedbacks to the items without observed feedbacks, which also implies that the items without observed feedbacks are treated equally without distinction. However, users have their own preference on different items with different degrees which can be modeled into a ranking relationship. In this paper, we exploit this prior information of a user's preference from the nearest neighbor set by the neighbors' implicit feedbacks, which can split items into different item groups with specific ranking relations. We propose a novel PRIGP(Personalized Ranking with Item Group based Pairwise preference learning) algorithm to integrate item based pairwise preference and item group based pairwise preference into the same framework. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the competitive baselines on several ranking-oriented evaluation metrics.},

 abstract = {Similarity search is an important problem in many large scale applications such as image and text retrieval. Hashing method has become popular for similarity search due to its fast search speed and low storage cost. Recent research has shown that hashing quality can be dramatically improved by incorporating supervised information, e.g. semantic tags/labels, into hashing function learning. However, most existing supervised hashing methods can be regarded as passive methods, which assume that the labeled data are provided in advance. But in many real world applications, such supervised information may not be available. This paper proposes a novel active hashing approach, Active Hashing with Joint Data Example and Tag Selection (AH-JDETS), which actively selects the most informative data examples and tags in a joint manner for hashing function learning. In particular, it first identifies a set of informative data examples and tags for users to label based on the selection criteria that both the data examples and tags should be most uncertain and dissimilar with each other. Then this labeled information is combined with the unlabeled data to generate an effective hashing function. An iterative procedure is proposed for learning the optimal hashing function and selecting the most informative data examples and tags. Extensive experiments on four different datasets demonstrate that AH-JDETS achieves good performance compared with state-of-the-art supervised hashing methods but requires much less labeling cost, which overcomes the limitation of passive hashing methods. Furthermore, experimental results also indicate that the joint active selection approach outperforms a random (non-active) selection method and active selection methods only focusing on either data examples or tags.},

 abstract = {A common problem in unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) information retrieval is the need to compute global statistics of the full collection, when only a small subset of the collection is visible to a peer. Without accurate estimates of these statistics, the effectiveness of modern retrieval models can be reduced. We show that for the case of a probably approximately correct P2P architecture, and using either the BM25 retrieval model or a language model with Dirichlet smoothing, very close approximations of the required global statistics can be estimated with very little overhead and a small extension to the protocol. However, through theoretical modeling and simulations we demonstrate this technique also greatly increases the ability for adversarial peers to manipulate search results. We show an adversary controlling fewer than 10% of peers can censor or increase the rank of documents, or disrupt overall search results. As a defense, we propose a simple modification to the extension, and show global statistics estimation is viable even when up to 40% of peers are adversarial.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates the temporal cluster hypothesis: in search tasks where time plays an important role, do relevant documents tend to cluster together in time? We explore this question in the context of tweet search and temporal feedback: starting with an initial set of results from a baseline retrieval model, we estimate the temporal density of relevant documents, which is then used for result reranking. Our contributions lie in a method to characterize this temporal density function using kernel density estimation, with and without human relevance judgments, and an approach to integrating this information into a standard retrieval model. Experiments on TREC datasets confirm that our temporal feedback formulation improves search effectiveness, thus providing support for our hypothesis. Our approach out-performs both a standard baseline and previous temporal retrieval models. Temporal feedback improves over standard lexical feedback (with and without human judgments), illus- trating that temporal relevance signals exist independently of document content.},

 abstract = {Microblogging services have emerged as an essential way to strengthen the communications among individuals. One of the most important features of microblog over traditional social networks is the extensive proliferation in information diffusion. As the outbreak of information diffusion often brings in valuable opportunities or devastating effects, it will be beneficial if a mechanism can be provided to predict whether a piece of information will become viral, and which part of the network will participate in propagating this information. In this work, we define three types of influences, namely, interest-oriented influence, social-oriented influence, and epidemic-oriented influence, that will affect a user's decision on whether to perform a diffusion action. We propose a diffusion-targeted influence model to differentiate and quantify various types of influence. Further we model the problem of diffusion prediction by factorizing a user's intention to transmit a microblog into these influences. The learned prediction model is then used to predict the future diffusion state of any new microblog. We conduct experiments on a real-world microblogging dataset to evaluate our method, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

 abstract = {We present a study to understand the effect that negated terms (e.g., "no fever") and family history (e.g., "family his- tory of diabetes") have on searching clinical records. Our analysis is aimed at devising the most effective means of handling negation and family history. In doing so, we explicitly represent a clinical record according to its different content types: negated, family history and normal content; the retrieval model weights each of these separately. Empirical evaluation shows that overall the presence of negation harms retrieval effectiveness while family history has little effect. We show negation is best handled by weighting negated content (rather than the common practise of re- moving or replacing it). However, we also show that many queries benefit from the inclusion of negated content and that negation is optimally handled on a per-query basis. Additional evaluation shows that adaptive handing of negated and family history content can have significant benefits.},

 abstract = {Online services rely on machine identifiers to tailor services such as personalized search and advertising to individual users. The assumption made is that each identifier comprises the behavior of a single person. However, shared machine usage is common, and in these cases, the activities of multiple users may be generated under a single identifier, creating a potentially noisy signal for applications such as search personalization. We propose enhancing Web search personalization with methods that can disambiguate among different users of a machine, thus connecting the current query with the appropriate search history. Using logs containing both person and machine identifiers, and logs from a popular commercial search engine, we learn models that accurately assign observed search behaviors to each of different users. This information is then used to augment existing personalization methods that are currently based only on machine identifiers. We show that this new capability to infer users can be used to improve the performance of existing personalization methods. The early findings of our research are promising and have implications for search personalization.},

@inproceedings{Sebastian:2014:CLP:2600428.2610376,
 abstract = {The potential impact of a scientific article has a significant correlation with its ability to establish novel connections between pre-existing knowledge [1-2]. Discovering hidden connections between the existing scientific literature is an interesting yet highly challenging information retrieval problem [2]. Literature based discovery (LBD) uses computational algorithms to discover potential hidden connections between previously disconnected sets of literature [3]. Most of the current LBD methods focus on analyzing latent semantic features in texts but are usually computationally demanding. In particular, they do not aim at predicting novel discovery links between clusters of literature. Combining latent semantic and structural features of literature is a promising yet unexplored LBD approach. This approach is potentially scalable and effective. For example, incorporating structural features of Web pages has increased the effectiveness of many large-scale IR systems [4]. The bibliographic structures of scientific papers make it possible to view a corpus of literature as a complex network of nodes (articles) and links (citation relationships) in which recognizable communities or clusters can be observed, each representing a distinct research field [5]. Consequently, potential hidden connections between disparate fields might be found from among non-overlapping clusters that do not have any existing link between their members yet exhibit a high propensity to converge in the future. This work approaches LBD as a cluster link prediction problem. We view disjoint literature sets as disjoint clusters in citation networks. Our method searches for hidden connections between disjoint clusters whose member nodes show high probabilities in forming future links. To this end, we address two research problems. The first problem is to group papers into clusters of distinct research areas. We compare the accuracy of well-known community detection algorithms, such as LOUVAIN and INFOMAP [5], in detecting research field clusters from citation networks of physics literature. We evaluate the quality of these clusters using purity, Rand Index, F-measure and Normalized Mutual Information [5-6]. Since ground truth communities are usually unknown, we also propose using alternative textual coherence measures such as Jensen-Shannon divergence [7]. The second problem is to predict the future formation of links between the nodes in previously disconnected clusters. We introduce a novel algorithm, Latent Domain Similarity (LDS), which uses combinations of semantic features (e.g. distribution of technical terms in titles and abstracts) and structural features (e.g. cited references, citing articles) of two or more articles in order to infer shared latent domains between them. We assume that while two sets of literature could have been published separately in two seemingly unrelated fields, it is possible that they share many similar domains previously unknown to researchers in each field. The goal is to explore whether these shared latent domains correlate with the probability of previously disconnected clusters to form future citation links with each other.},
