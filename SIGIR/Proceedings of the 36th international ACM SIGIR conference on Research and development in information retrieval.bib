 abstract = {The task of finding groups is a natural extension of search tasks aimed at retrieving individual entities. We introduce a group finding task: given a query topic, find knowledgeable groups that have expertise on that topic. We present four general strategies to this task. The models are formalized using generative language models. Two of the models aggregate expertise scores of the experts in the same group for the task, one locates documents associated with experts in the group and then determines how closely the documents are associated with the topic, whilst the remaining model directly estimates the degree to which a group is a knowledgeable group for a given topic. We construct a test collections based on the TREC 2005 and 2006 Enterprise collections. We find significant differences between different ways of estimating the association between a topic and a group. Experiments show that our knowledgeable group finding models achieve high absolute scores.},

@proceedings{Jones:2013:2484028,
 abstract = {Welcome to SIGIR, the 36th annual international ACM conference on research and development in Information Retrieval. SIGIR is the premier, international venue for research and development in information retrieval. We believe the breadth and diversity of research that comprises the program reflects the health of the organization and major future directions of the field. We are grateful to all those who submitted papers to the conference and gave the Committee an opportunity to evaluate their work for potential inclusion in the program. We are also grateful to the 50 Area Chairs and 204 general program committee members, who represent 30 countries and over 120 institutions, for all the hard work they put into evaluating submissions. The conference received 366 full paper submissions this year. Of these, 73 (20%) were accepted, essentially the same as last year's acceptance rate and the year before. The top five countries in terms of accepted papers (according to contact author affiliation) were the U.S.A. (28), China (9), the Netherlands, Singapore, and U.K. (5 each). The top five technical areas covered by the accepted papers (as indicated by the primary keyword assigned by paper authors) were users and interactive IR (16%), search engine architecture and scalability (15%), queries and query analysis (15%), evaluation (11%), and retrieval models and ranking (11%). This represents only a slight re-ordering of topics from last year. Two hundred fifty papers were submitted to the short papers track, which represents a 20% increase in the number of submissions made to last year's poster track. Eighty-five (34%) short papers were accepted. In addition, 46 demonstrations were proposed, of which 23 (50%) were accepted. The program also consisted of 7 workshops and 10 tutorials. Finally, the Doctoral Consortium hosted 11 students this year from 10 countries and 11 institutions. As has been customary for many years, SIGIR 2013 used a two-tier double-blind review process. In the first stage, at least three reviewers read every paper and provided ratings and comments. Papers were evaluated according to seven main criteria: relevance, originality, soundness, quality of the presentation, impact, coverage of the literature, and, for the first time, reproducibility of the results. In the second stage, the primary and secondary Area Chairs ensured the quality of the reviewing process by studying, validating, and summarizing these reviews, and adding their own feedback and ratings. Area Chairs initiated discussions among reviewers to resolve any controversial issues or significant differences of opinion. Once the discussion stage was completed, the two Area Chairs made a recommendation regarding the paper for nearly all submissions. This year we allowed Area Chairs to indicate that a paper should be accepted if room. At the program committee meeting held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, the Program Chairs and the attending Area Chairs went over the reviews, verified the process, gathered additional input, and discussed and decided on papers that were balloted as accept if room, papers from which the primary Area Chair abstained and papers that had unusual score distributions. For papers that were balloted as accept if room, we especially considered the potential for the paper to provoke interesting and fruitful discussion at the conference. Ultimately 73 papers were selected for inclusion in the program. One important change to this year's program was renaming the poster paper submission type to short papers and increasing the length of the paper from two to four pages. Short papers were presented at the conference in poster format and two separate short paper sessions were included as part of the main conference program, rather than a single event collocated with an evening reception. We believe that increasing the length of the accompanying paper allows researchers to better communicate their experiments and results, which in turn, will allow this submission type to function as a more comprehensive and substantial container for small, but significant findings. We further believe this change better allows research presented in this format to get the attention it deserves. We would like to thank the Short Paper Co-Chairs for all the extra work they did this year managing this new format and the Short Paper reviewers for the great job they did handling both the larger volume of submissions and their increased size. We believe the large increase in number of submissions to this track indicates the community's receptiveness to this change. We hope you find this program interesting, provocative and inspiring, and that the conference provides you with a valuable opportunity to share ideas with other researchers, practitioners and students from institutions around the world. The deadline for SIGIR 2014 is, after all, only six months away!},

With this method, searching for a mental visual target reduces to scanning data according to their coordinates in the learned semantic space.

 abstract = {Sometimes, during a search task users may switch from one search engine to another for several reasons, e.g., dissatisfaction with the current search results or desire for broader topic coverage. Detecting the fact of switching is difficult but important for understanding users' satisfaction with the search engine and the complexity of their search tasks, leading to economic significance for search providers. Previous research on switching detection mainly focused on studying different signals useful for the task and particular reasons for switching. Although it is known that switching is a personal choice of a user and different users have different search behavior, little has been done to understand how these differences could be used for switching detection. In this paper we study the effectiveness of learning personal behavior patterns for switching detection and present a personalized approach which uses user's session history containing sessions with and without switches. Experiments show that users' personal habits and behavior patterns are indeed among the most informative signals. Our findings can be used by a search log analyzer for engine switching detection and potentially other log mining problems, thus providing valuable signals for search providers to improve user experience.},

We introduce four preliminary uses of our framework: (1) a measure of conditional rank correlation, information tau, a powerful meta-evaluation tool whose use we demonstrate on understanding novelty and diversity evaluation; (2) a new evaluation measure, relevance information correlation, which is correlated with traditional evaluation measures and can be used to (3) evaluate a collection of systems simultaneously, which provides a natural upper bound on metasearch performance; and (4) a measure of the similarity between rankers on judged documents, information difference, which allows us to determine whether systems with similar performance are in fact different.},

However, due to voice input errors (such as speech recognition errors and improper system interruptions), users need to frequently reformulate queries to handle the incorrectly recognized queries. We conducted user experiments with native English speakers on their query reformulation behaviors in voice search and found that users often reformulate queries with both lexical and phonetic changes to previous queries. In this paper, we first characterize and analyze typical voice input errors in voice search and users' corresponding reformulation strategies. Then, we evaluate the impacts of typical voice input errors on users' search progress and the effectiveness of different reformulation strategies on handling these errors. This study provides a clearer picture on how to further improve current voice search systems.},

The conference continues its tradition of being the premier forum for research and development information retrieval, the computer science discipline behind what many call "search". The high number of submitted papers, this year again, demonstrates both the breadth and depth of the research being done in this vibrant field, both in academia and industry. We have done our best to ensure that these papers meet high standards of quality in terms of technical contribution, innovation, presentation, reference to previous work, and methodology. At the same time, we have tried to be flexible in the application of these criteria in order to consider papers describing novel and innovative work that may be somewhat unconventional. The conference received 483 full paper submissions this year. Examining the country code of the paper's contact author, we found that 185 (38%) come from the Americas; 158 (33%), Asia and Pacific region; and 140 (29%) from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Of these, 98 (20%) were accepted, essentially the same as last year's acceptance rate and up from the 16.7% rate of the year before. There was almost no difference in the acceptance rates across the three broad regions. The top five countries in terms of accepted papers were the U.S.A. (36), China (14), the U.K. & Spain (both 7), and the Netherlands (6). In addition, 208 short papers were submitted to the poster track, of which 76 (36.5%) were accepted. In the other categories, there were 17 (47.2%) demonstrations, 4 workshops, and 16 tutorials accepted. The top five technical areas (as inferred from the primary keyword assigned by the authors) covered by the accepted papers, were queries and query analysis (18%), retrieval models and ranking (14%), web IR & social media search (13%), document representation and content analysis (11%), and users and interactive IR (9%). This was a small re-ordering of the topics from last year. SIGIR this year again used a two-tier double-blind reviewing approach. In a first stage, at least three reviewers read every paper and provided ratings and comments. Then, in a second stage, the primary and secondary Area Chairs ensured the quality of the reviewing process by studying, validating, and summarizing these reviews, and adding their own feedback and ratings.

 abstract = {Traditional Web search engines do not use the images in the HTML pages to find relevant documents for a given query. Instead, they typically operate by computing a measure of agreement between the keywords provided by the user and only the text portion of each page. In this paper we study whether the content of the pictures appearing in a Web page can be used to enrich the semantic description of an HTML document and consequently boost the performance of a keyword-based search engine. We present a Web-scalable system that exploits a pure text-based search engine to find an initial set of candidate documents for a given query. Then, the candidate set is reranked using semantic information extracted from the images contained in the pages. The resulting system retains the computational efficiency of traditional text-based search engines with only a small additional storage cost needed to encode the visual information. We test our approach on the TREC 2009 Million Query Track, where we show that our use of visual content yields improvement in accuracies for two distinct text-based search engines, including the system with the best reported performance on this benchmark.},

 abstract = {Collaborative web sites, such as collaborative encyclopedias, blogs, and forums, are characterized by a loose edit control, which allows anyone to freely edit their content. As a consequence, the quality of this content raises much concern. To deal with this, many sites adopt manual quality control mechanisms. However, given their size and change rate, manual assessment strategies do not scale and content that is new or unpopular is seldom reviewed. This has a negative impact on the many services provided, such as ranking and recommendation. To tackle with this problem, we propose a learning to rank (L2R) approach for ranking answers in Q&A forums. In particular, we adopt an approach based on Random Forests and represent query and answer pairs using eight different groups of features. Some of these features are used in the Q&A domain for the first time. Our L2R method was trained to learn the answer rating, based on the feedback users give to answers in Q&A forums. Using the proposed method, we were able (i) to outperform a state of the art baseline with gains of up to 21% in NDCG, a metric used to evaluate rankings; we also conducted a comprehensive study of the features, showing that (ii) review and user features are the most important in the Q&A domain although text features are useful for assessing quality of new answers; and (iii) the best set of new features we proposed was able to yield the best quality rankings.},

 abstract = {Social recommendation problems have drawn a lot of attention recently due to the prevalence of social networking sites. The experiments in previous literature suggest that social information is very effective in improving traditional recommendation algorithms. However, explicit social information is not always available in most of the recommender systems, which limits the impact of social recommendation techniques. In this paper, we study the following two research problems: (1) In some systems without explicit social information, can we still improve recommender systems using implicit social information? (2) In the systems with explicit social information, can the performance of using implicit social information outperform that of using explicit social information? In order to answer these two questions, we conduct comprehensive experimental analysis on three recommendation datasets. The result indicates that: (1) Implicit user and item social information, including similar and dissimilar relationships, can be employed to improve traditional recommendation methods. (2) When comparing implicit social information with explicit social information, the performance of using implicit information is slightly worse. This study provides additional insights to social recommendation techniques, and also greatly widens the utility and spreads the impact of previous and upcoming social recommendation approaches.},

 abstract = {People's beliefs, and unconscious biases that arise from those beliefs, influence their judgment, decision making, and actions, as is commonly accepted among psychologists. Biases can be observed in information retrieval in situations where searchers seek or are presented with information that significantly deviates from the truth. There is little understanding of the impact of such biases in search. In this paper we study search-related biases via multiple probes: an exploratory retrospective survey, human labeling of the captions and results returned by a Web search engine, and a large-scale log analysis of search behavior on that engine. Targeting yes-no questions in the critical domain of health search, we show that Web searchers exhibit their own biases and are also subject to bias from the search engine. We clearly observe searchers favoring positive information over negative and more than expected given base rates based on consensus answers from physicians. We also show that search engines strongly favor a particular, usually positive, perspective, irrespective of the truth. Importantly, we show that these biases can be counterproductive and affect search outcomes; in our study, around half of the answers that searchers settled on were actually incorrect. Our findings have implications for search engine design, including the development of ranking algorithms that con-sider the desire to satisfy searchers (by validating their beliefs) and providing accurate answers and properly considering base rates. Incorporating likelihood information into search is particularly important for consequential tasks, such as those with a medical focus.},

@inproceedings{Sakai:2013:SRR:2484028.2484031,
 abstract = {We introduce a general information access evaluation framework that can potentially handle summaries, ranked document lists and even multi query sessions seamlessly. Our framework first builds a trailtext which represents a concatenation of all the texts read by the user during a search session, and then computes an evaluation metric called U-measure over the trailtext. Instead of discounting the value of a retrieved piece of information based on ranks, U-measure discounts it based on its position within the trailtext. U-measure takes the document length into account just like Time-Biased Gain (TBG), and has the diminishing return property. It is therefore more realistic than rank-based metrics. Furthermore, it is arguably more flexible than TBG, as it is free from the linear traversal assumption (i.e., that the user scans the ranked list from top to bottom), and can handle information access tasks other than ad hoc retrieval. This paper demonstrates the validity and versatility of the U-measure framework. Our main conclusions are: (a) For ad hoc retrieval, U-measure is at least as reliable as TBG in terms of rank correlations with traditional metrics and discriminative power; (b) For diversified search, our diversity versions of U-measure are highly correlated with state-of-the-art diversity metrics; (c) For multi-query sessions, U-measure is highly correlated with Session nDCG; and (d) Unlike rank-based metrics such as DCG, U-measure can quantify the differences between linear and nonlinear traversals in sessions. We argue that our new framework is useful for understanding the user's search behaviour and for comparison across different information access styles (e.g. examining a direct answer vs. examining a ranked list of web pages).},

@inproceedings{Limsopatham:2013:QPU:2484028.2484228,
 abstract = {Electronic medical records (EMRs) are being increasingly used worldwide to facilitate improved healthcare services [2,3]. They describe the clinical decision process relating to a patient, detailing the observed symptoms, the conducted diagnostic tests, the identified diagnoses and the prescribed treatments. However, medical records search is challenging, due to the implicit knowledge inherent within the medical records - such knowledge may be known by medical practitioners, but hidden to an information retrieval (IR) system [3]. For instance, the mention of a treatment such as a drug may indicate to a practitioner that a particular diagnosis has been made even if this was not explicitly mentioned in the patient's EMRs. Moreover, the fact that a symptom has not been observed by a clinician may rule out some specific diagnoses. Our work focuses on searching EMRs to identify patients with medical histories relevant to the medical condition(s) stated in a query. The resulting system can be beneficial to healthcare providers, administrators, and researchers who may wish to analyse the effectiveness of a particular medical procedure to combat a specific disease [2,4]. During retrieval, a healthcare provider may indicate a number of inclusion criteria to describe the type of patients of interest. For example, the used criteria may include personal profiles (e.g. age and gender) or some specific medical symptoms and tests, allowing to identify patients that have EMRs matching the criteria. To attain effective retrieval performance, we hypothesise that, in such a medical IR system, both the information needs and patients should be modelled based on how the medical process is developed. Specifically, our thesis states that since the medical decision process typically encompasses four aspects (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis, and treatment), a medical search system should take into account these aspects and apply inferences to recover possible implicit knowledge. We postulate that considering these aspects and their derived implicit knowledge at different levels of the retrieval process (namely, sentence, record, and inter-record level) enhances the retrieval performance. Indeed, we propose to build a query and patient understanding framework that can gain insights from EMRs and queries, by modelling and reasoning during retrieval in terms of the four aforementioned aspects (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis, and treatment) at three different levels of the retrieval process.},

 abstract = {The availability of user check-in data in large volume from the rapid growing location based social networks (LBSNs) enables many important location-aware services to users. Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is one of such services, which is to recommend places where users have not visited before. Several techniques have been recently proposed for the recommendation service. However, no existing work has considered the temporal information for POI recommendations in LBSNs. We believe that time plays an important role in POI recommendations because most users tend to visit different places at different time in a day, \eg visiting a restaurant at noon and visiting a bar at night. In this paper, we define a new problem, namely, the time-aware POI recommendation, to recommend POIs for a given user at a specified time in a day. To solve the problem, we develop a collaborative recommendation model that is able to incorporate temporal information. Moreover, based on the observation that users tend to visit nearby POIs, we further enhance the recommendation model by considering geographical information. Our experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art POI recommendation methods substantially.},

Existing approaches binarise LSH projections by thresholding at zero yielding a single bit per dimension. We demonstrate that this is a sub-optimal bit allocation approach that can easily destroy the neighbourhood structure in the original feature space. Our proposed method, dubbed Neighbourhood Preserving Quantization (NPQ), assigns multiple bits per hyperplane based upon adaptively learned thresholds. NPQ exploits a pairwise affinity matrix to discretise each dimension such that nearest neighbours in the original feature space fall within the same quantisation thresholds and are therefore assigned identical bits. NPQ is not only applicable to LSH, but can also be applied to any low-dimensional projection scheme. Despite using half the number of hyperplanes, NPQ is shown to improve LSH-based retrieval accuracy by up to 65% compared to the state-of-the-art.},

In this paper, we propose a further level of abstraction, claiming that the successive normalizations are carried out through composition. Thus we introduce a principled framework that fully explains BM25 as a variant of TF-IDF with an inverse order of function composition. Our experiments over standard datasets indicate that the respective orders of composition chosen in the original papers for both TF-IDF and BM25 are the most effective ones. Moreover, since the order is different between the two models, they also demonstrated that the order is instrumental in the design of weighting models. In fact, while considering more complex scoring functions such as BM25+, we discovered a novel weighting model in terms of order of composition that consistently outperforms all the rest. Our contribution here is twofold: we provide a unifying mathematical framework for IR and a novel scoring function discovered using this framework.},

 abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a persistent interest in generating pseudo test collections, both for training and evaluation purposes. We describe a method for generating queries and relevance judgments for microblog search in an unsupervised way. Our starting point is this intuition: tweets with a hashtag are relevant to the topic covered by the hashtag and hence to a suitable query derived from the hashtag. Our baseline method selects all commonly used hashtags, and all associated tweets as relevance judgments; we then generate a query from these tweets. Next, we generate a timestamp for each query, allowing us to use temporal information in the training process. We then enrich the generation process with knowledge derived from an editorial test collection for microblog search. We use our pseudo test collections in two ways. First, we tune parameters of a variety of well known retrieval methods on them. Correlations with parameter sweeps on an editorial test collection are high on average, with a large variance over retrieval algorithms. Second, we use the pseudo test collections as training sets in a learning to rank scenario. Performance close to training on an editorial test collection is achieved in many cases. Our results demonstrate the utility of tuning and training microblog search algorithms on automatically generated training material.},

Recently, the nearest-neighbor based scheme has been proposed and achieved good performance for image annotation. Given a new image, the scheme is to first find its most similar neighbors from labeled images, and then propagate the keywords associated with the neighbors to it. Many studies focused on designing a suitable distance metric between images so that all labeled images can be ranked by their distance to the given image. However, higher accuracy in distance prediction does not necessarily lead to better ordering of labeled images. In this paper, we propose a ranking-oriented neighbor search mechanism to rank labeled images directly without going through the intermediate step of distance prediction. In particular, a new learning to rank algorithm is developed, which exploits the implicit preference information of labeled images and underlines the accuracy of the top-ranked results. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image annotation.},

In this paper, we present a novel term ranking algorithm, PhRank, that extends work on Markov chain frameworks for query expansion to select compact and focused terms from within a query itself. This focuses queries so that one to five terms in an unweighted model achieve better retrieval effectiveness than weighted term selection models that use up to 30 terms. PhRank terms are also typically compact and contain 1-2 words compared to competing models that use query subsets up to 7 words long. PhRank captures query context with an affinity graph constructed using word co-occurrence in pseudo-relevant documents. A random walk of the graph is used for term ranking in combination with discrimination weights. Empirical evaluation using newswire and web collections demonstrates that performance of reformulated queries is significantly improved for long queries and at least as good for short, keyword queries compared to highly competitive information retrieval (IR) models.},

 abstract = {Microblog services have emerged as an essential way to strengthen the communications among individuals and organizations. These services promote timely and active discussions and comments towards products, markets as well as public events, and have attracted a lot of attentions from organizations. In particular, emerging topics are of immediate concerns to organizations since they signal current concerns of, and feedback by their users. Two challenges must be tackled for effective emerging topic detection. One is the problem of real-time relevant data collection and the other is the ability to model the emerging characteristics of detected topics and identify them before they become hot topics. To tackle these challenges, we first design a novel scheme to crawl the relevant messages related to the designated organization by monitoring multi-aspects of microblog content, including users, the evolving keywords and their temporal sequence. We then develop an incremental clustering framework to detect new topics, and employ a range of content and temporal features to help in promptly detecting hot emerging topics. Extensive evaluations on a representative real-world dataset based on Twitter data demonstrate that our scheme is able to characterize emerging topics well and detect them before they become hot topics.},

 abstract = {The importance of Information Retrieval (IR) in audio-visual recordings has been increasing with steeply growing numbers of audio-visual documents available on-line. Compared to traditional IR methods, this task requires specific techniques, such as Passage Retrieval which can accelerate the search process by retrieving the exact relevant passage of a recording instead of the full document. In Passage Retrieval, full recordings are divided into shorter segments which serve as individual documents for the further IR setup. This technique also allows normalizing document length and applying positional information. It was shown that it can even improve retrieval results. In this work, we examine two general strategies for Passage Retrieval: blind segmentation into overlapping regular-length passages and segmentation into variable-length passages based on semantics of their content. Time-based segmentation was already shown to improve retrieval of textual documents and audio-visual recordings. Our experiments performed on the test collection used in the Search subtask of the Search and Hyperlinking Task in MediaEval Benchmarking 2012 confirm those findings and show that parameters (segment length and shift) tuning for a specific test collection can further improve the results. Our best results on this collection were achieved by using 45-second long segments with 15-second shifts. Semantic-based segmentation can be divided into three types: similarity-based (producing segments with high intra-similarity and low inter-similarity), lexical-chain-based (producing segments with frequent lexically connected words), and feature-based (combining various features which signalize a segment break in a machine-learning setting). In this work, we mainly focus on feature-based segmentation which allows exploiting various features from all modalities of the data (including segment length) in a single trainable model and produces segments which can eventually overlap. Our preliminary results show that even simple semantic-based segmentation outperforms regular segmentation. Our model is a decision tree incorporating the following features: shot segments, output of TextTiling algorithm, cue words (well, thanks, so, I, now), sentence breaks, and the length of the silence after the previous word. In terms of the MASP, the relative improvement over regular segmentation is more than 19%.},

We discuss the role semantic ontologies for representing audio-visual concepts and relationships, which are essential for training semantic classifiers. We discuss the importance of using faceted classification schemes in particular for organizing multimedia semantic concepts in order to achieve effective learning and retrieval. We also show how training and scoring of multimedia semantics can be implemented on big data distributed computing platforms to address both massive-scale analysis and low-latency processing. We describe multiple efforts at IBM on image and video analysis and retrieval, including IBM Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System (IMARS), and show recent results for semantic-based classification and retrieval. We conclude with future directions for improving analysis of multimedia through interactive and curriculum-based techniques for multimedia semantics-based learning and retrieval.},

One of the biggest challenges of crowdsourcing is aggregating the answers collected from crowd workers; and thus, many aggregate techniques have been proposed. However, given a new application, it is difficult for users to choose the best-suited technique as well as appropriate parameter values since each of these techniques has distinct performance characteristics depending on various factors (e.g. worker expertise, question difficulty). In this paper, we develop a benchmarking tool that allows to (i) simulate the crowd and (ii) evaluate aggregate techniques in different aspects (accuracy, sensitivity to spammers, etc.). We believe that this tool will be able to serve as a practical guideline for both researchers and software developers. While researchers can use our tool to assess existing or new techniques, developers can reuse its components to reduce the development complexity.},

We model a singer's vocal competence as singer profile, which takes voice pitch, intensity, and quality into consideration. Then we propose techniques to acquire singer profiles. We also present a song profile model which is used to construct a human annotated song database. Finally, we propose a learning-to-rank scheme for recommending songs by singer profile. The experimental study on real singers demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and its advantages over two baseline methods.

 abstract = {Community Question Answering (CQA) services, such as Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers, have become popular with users as one of the central paradigms for satisfying users' information needs. The task of question retrieval in CQA aims to resolve one's query directly by finding the most relevant questions (together with their answers) from an archive of past questions. However, as users can ask any question that they like, a large number of questions in CQA are not about objective (factual) knowledge, but about subjective (sentiment-based) opinions or social interactions. The inhomogeneous nature of CQA leads to reduced performance of standard retrieval models. To address this problem, we present a hybrid approach that blends several language modelling techniques for question retrieval, namely, the classic (query-likelihood) language model, the state-of-the-art translation-based language model, and our proposed intent-based language model. The user intent of each candidate question (objective/subjective/social) is given by a probabilistic classifier which makes use of both textual features and metadata features. Our experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach can significantly outperform existing ones.},

 abstract = {Evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems has recently been exploring the use of preference judgments over two search result lists. Unlike the traditional method of collecting relevance labels per single result, this method allows to consider the interaction between search results as part of the judging criteria. For example, one result list may be preferred over another if it has a more diverse set of relevant results, covering a wider range of user intents. In this paper, we investigate how assessors determine their preference for one list of results over another with the aim to understand the role of various relevance dimensions in preference-based evaluation. We run a series of experiments and collect preference judgments over different relevance dimensions in side-by-side comparisons of two search result lists, as well as relevance judgments for the individual documents. Our analysis of the collected judgments reveals that preference judgments combine multiple dimensions of relevance that go beyond the traditional notion of relevance centered on topicality. Measuring performance based on single document judgments and NDCG aligns well with topicality based preferences, but shows misalignment with judges' overall preferences, largely due to the diversity dimension. As a judging method, dimensional preference judging is found to lead to improved judgment quality.},

In this research, we propose a framework to organize information from multiple UGC sources by a topic hierarchy which is automatically generated and updated using the UGCs. We explore the unique characteristics of UGCs like blogs, cQAs, microblogs, etc., and introduce a novel scheme to combine them. We also propose a graph-based method to enable incremental update of the generated topic hierarchy. Using the hierarchy, users can easily obtain a comprehensive, in-depth and up-to-date picture of their topics of interests. The experiment results demonstrate how information from multiple heterogeneous sources improves the resultant topic hierarchies. It also shows that the proposed method achieves better F1 scores in hierarchy generation as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

State-of-the-art shard selection algorithms first query a central index of sampled documents, and their effectiveness is similar to searching all shards. However, the search in the central index also hurts efficiency. Additionally, we show that the effectiveness of these approaches varies substantially with the sampled documents. This paper proposes Taily, a novel shard selection algorithm that models a query's score distribution in each shard as a Gamma distribution and selects shards with highly scored documents in the tail of the distribution. Taily estimates the parameters of score distributions based on the mean and variance of the score function's features in the collections and shards. Because Taily operates on term statistics instead of document samples, it is efficient and has deterministic effectiveness. Experiments on large web collections (Gov2, CluewebA and CluewebB) show that Taily achieves similar effectiveness to sample-based approaches, and improves upon their efficiency by roughly 20% in terms of used resources and response time.},

These models, however, fail to address how and when different image contexts can be combined. In this paper, we propose a weighted tag recommendation model, building on an existing state-of-the-art, which varies the importance of time and location in the recommendation process, based on a given set of input tags. By retrieving more temporally and geographically relevant tags, we achieve statistically significant improvements to recommendation accuracy when testing on 519k images collected from Flickr.

@inproceedings{Crane:2013:DRF:2484028.2484227,
 abstract = {The need for a search engine to deal with ambiguous queries has been known for a long time (diversification). However, it is only recently that this need has become a focus within information retrieval research. How to respond to indications that a result is relevant to a query (relevance feedback) has also been a long focus of research. When thinking about the results for a query as being clustered by topic, these two areas of information retrieval research appear to be opposed to each other. Interestingly though, they both appear to improve the performance of search engines, raising the question: they can be combined or made to work with each other? When presented with an ambiguous query there are a number of techniques that can be employed to better select results. The primary technique being researched now is diversification, which aims to populate the results with a set of documents that cover different possible interpretations for the query, while maintaining a degree of relevance, as determined by the search engine. For example, given a query of "java" it is unclear whether the user, without any other information, means the programming language, the coffee, the island of Indonesia or a multitude of other meanings. In order to do this the assumption that documents are independent of each other when assessing potential relevance has to be broken. That is, a documents relevance, as calculated by the search engine, is no longer dependent only on the query, but also the other documents that have been selected. How a document is identified as being similar to previously selected documents, and the trade off between estimated relevance and topic coverage are current areas for information retrieval research. For unambiguous queries, or for search engines that do not perform diversification, it is possible to improve the results selected by reacting to information identifying a given result as truly relevant or not. This mechanism is known as relevance feedback. The most common response to relevance feedback is to investigate the documents for their most content-bearing terms, and either add, or subtract, their influence to a newly formed query which is then re-run on the remaining documents to re-order them. There has been a scant amount of research into the combination of these methods. However, Carbonell et al. [1] show that an initially diverse result set can provide a better approach for identifying the topic a user is interested in for a relevance feedback style approach. This approach was further extended by Raman et al. [4]. An important aspect of relevance feedback is the selection of documents to use. In the 2008 TREC relevance feedback track, Meij et al. [3] generated a diversified result set which outperformed other rankings as a source of feedback documents. The use of pseudo-relevance feedback (assuming the top ranked documents are relevant) to extract sub-topics for use in diversification was explored by Santos et al. [5]. These previous approaches suggest that these two ideas are more linked than expected. The ATIRE search engine [6] will be used to further explore the relationship between diversification and relevance feedback. ATIRE was selected because it is developed locally, and is designed to be small and fast. ATIRE also produces a competitive baseline, which would have placed 6th in the 2011 TREC diversity task while performing no diversification and index-time spam filtering [2], although we concede this is not equivalent to submitting a run.},

In this paper, we describe a new data structure, a Cardinality Filter, to quickly compute an upper bound on the size of a set intersection. Knowing an upper bound of the size can be used to accelerate many applications such as top-k query processing in text mining. Given finite sets A and B, the expected computation time for the upper bound of the size of the intersection |A cap B| is O( (|A| + |B|) w), where w is the machine word length. This is much faster than the current best algorithm for the exact intersection, which runs in O((|A| + |B|) / √w + |A cap B|) expected time. Our performance studies show that our implementations of Cardinality Filters are from 2 to 10 times faster than existing set intersection algorithms, and the time for a top-k query in a text mining application can be reduced by half.},

@inproceedings{Dang:2013:TLS:2484028.2484095,
 abstract = {Current approaches for search result diversification have been categorized as either implicit or explicit. The implicit approach assumes each document represents its own topic, and promotes diversity by selecting documents for different topics based on the difference of their vocabulary. On the other hand, the explicit approach models the set of query topics, or aspects. While the former approach is generally less effective, the latter usually depends on a manually created description of the query aspects, the automatic construction of which has proven difficult. This paper introduces a new approach: term-level diversification. Instead of modeling the set of query aspects, which are typically represented as coherent groups of terms, our approach uses terms without the grouping. Our results on the ClueWeb collection show that the grouping of topic terms provides very little benefit to diversification compared to simply using the terms themselves. Consequently, we demonstrate that term-level diversification, with topic terms identified automatically from the search results using a simple greedy algorithm, significantly outperforms methods that attempt to create a full topic structure for diversification.},

 abstract = {Novel and diverse document ranking is an effective strategy that involves reducing redundancy in a ranked list to maximize the amount of novel and relevant information available to users. Evaluation for novelty and diversity typically involves an assessor judging each document for relevance against a set of pre-identified subtopics, which may be disambiguations of the query, facets of an information need, or nuggets of information. Alternately, when expressing a \emph{preference} for document A or document B, users may implicitly take subtopics into account, but may also take into account other factors such as recency, readability, length, and so on, each of which may have more or less importance depending on user. A \emph{user profile} contains information about the extent to which each factor, including subtopic relevance, plays a role in the user's preference for one document over another. A preference-based evaluation can then take this user profile information into account to better model utility to the space of users. In this work, we propose an evaluation framework that not only can consider implicit factors but also handles differences in user preference due to varying underlying information need. Our proposed framework is based on the idea that a user scanning a ranked list from top to bottom and stopping at rank $k$ gains some utility from every document that is relevant their information need. Thus, we model the expected utility of a ranked list by estimating the utility of a document at a given rank using preference judgments and define evaluation measures based on the same. We validate our framework by comparing it to existing measures such as $\alpha$-nDCG, ERR-IA, and subtopic recall that require explicit subtopic judgments We show that our proposed measures correlate well with existing measures while having the potential to capture various other factors when real data is used. We also show that the proposed measures can easily handle relevance assessments against multiple user profiles, and that they are robust to noisy and incomplete judgments.},

 abstract = {Text search engines are a fundamental tool nowadays. Their efficiency relies on a popular and simple data structure: the inverted indexes. Currently, inverted indexes can be represented very efficiently using index compression schemes. Recent investigations also study how an optimized document ordering can be used to assign document identifiers (docIDs) to the document database. This yields important improvements in index compression and query processing time. In this paper we follow this line of research, yet from a different perspective. We propose a docID reassignment method that allows one to focus on a given subset of inverted lists to improve their performance. We then use run-length encoding to compress these lists (as many consecutive 1s are generated). We show that by using this approach, not only the performance of the particular subset of inverted lists is improved, but also that of the whole inverted index. Our experimental results indicate a reduction of about 10% in the space usage of the whole index docID reassignment was focused. Also, decompression speed is up to 1.22 times faster if the runs must be explicitly decompressed and up to 4.58 times faster if implicit decompression of runs is allowed. Finally, we also improve the Document-at-a-Time query processing time of AND queries (by up to 12%), WAND queries (by up to 23%) and full (non-ranked) OR queries (by up to 86%).},

Existing caching techniques for search engine optimization are mostly biased towards the reduction of random accesses to disks, because random accesses are known to be much more expensive than sequential accesses in traditional magnetic hard disk drive (HDD). Recently, solid state drive (SSD) has emerged as a new kind of secondary storage medium, and some search engines like Baidu have already used SSD to completely replace HDD in their infrastructure. One notable property of SSD is that its random access latency is comparable to its sequential access latency. Therefore, the use of SSDs to replace HDDs in a search engine infrastructure may void the cache management of existing search engines. In this paper, we carry out a series of empirical experiments to study the impact of SSD on search engine cache management. The results give insights to practitioners and researchers on how to adapt the infrastructure and how to redesign the caching policies for SSD-based search engines.},

 abstract = {Expert retrieval has been widely studied especially after the introduction of Expert Finding task in the TREC's Enterprise Track in 2005 [3]. This track provided two different test collections crawled from two organizations' public-facing websites and internal emails which led to the development of many state-of-the-art algorithms on expert retrieval [1]. Until recently, these datasets were considered good representatives of the information resources available within enterprise. However, the recent growth of social media also influenced the work environment, and social media became a common communication and collaboration tool within organizations. According to a recent survey by McKinsey Global Institute [2], 29% of the companies use at least one social media tool for matching their employees to tasks, and 26% of them assess their employees' performance by using social media. This shows that intra-organizational social media became an important resource to identify expertise within organizations. In recent years, in addition to the intra-organizational social media, public social media tools like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn also became common environments for searching expertise. These tools provide an opportunity for their users to show their specific skills to the world which motivates recruiters to look for talented job candidates on social media, or writers and reporters to find experts for consulting on specific topics they are working on. With these motivations in mind, in this work we propose to develop expert retrieval algorithms for intra-organizational and public social media tools. Social media datasets have both challenges and advantages. In terms of challenges, they do not always contain context on one specific domain, instead one social media tool may contain discussions on technical stuff, hobbies or news concurrently. They may also contain spam posts or advertisements. Compared to well-edited enterprise documents, they are much more informal in language. Furthermore, depending on the social media platform, they may have limits on the number of characters used in posts. Even though they include the challenges stated above, they also bring some unique authority signals, such as votes, comments, follower/following information, which can be useful in estimating expertise. Furthermore, compared to previously used enterprise documents, social media provides clear associations between documents and candidates in the context of authorship information. In this work, we propose to develop expert retrieval approaches which will handle these challenges while making use of the advantages. Expert retrieval is a very useful application by itself; furthermore, it can be a step towards improving other social media applications. Social media is different than other web based tools mainly because it is dependent on its users. In social media, users are not just content consumers, but they are also the primary and sometimes the only content creators. Therefore, the quality of any user-generated content in social media depends on its creator. In this thesis, we propose to use expertise of users in order to improve the existing applications so that they can estimate the relevancy of a content not just based on the content, but also based on the expertise of the content creator. By using expertise of the content generator, we also hope to boost contents that are more reliable. We propose to apply this user's expertise information in order to improve ad-hoc search and question answering applications in social media. In this work, previous TREC enterprise datasets, available intra-organizational social media and public social media datasets will be used to test the proposed algorithms.},

 abstract = {Statistical translation models and latent semantic analysis (LSA) are two effective approaches to exploiting click-through data for Web search ranking. While the former learns semantic relationships between query terms and document terms directly, the latter maps a document and the queries for which it has been clicked to vectors in a lower dimensional semantic space. This paper presents two document ranking models that combine the strengths of both the approaches by explicitly modeling word-pairs. The first model, called PairModel, is a monolingual ranking model based on word-pairs derived from click-through data. It maps queries and documents into a concept space spanned by these word-pairs. The second model, called Bilingual Paired Topic Model (BPTM), uses bilingual word translations and can jointly model query-document collections written in multiple languages. This model uses topics to capture term dependencies and maps queries and documents in multiple languages into a lower dimensional semantic sub-space spanned by the topics. These models are evaluated on the Web search task using real world data sets in three different languages. Results show that they consistently outperform various state-of-the-art baseline models, and the best result is obtained by interpolating PairModel and BPTM.},

 abstract = {In modern search engines, an increasing number of search result pages (SERPs) are federated from multiple specialized search engines (called verticals, such as Image or Video). As an effective approach to interpret users' click-through behavior as feedback information, most click models were designed to reduce the position bias and improve ranking performance of ordinary search results, which have homogeneous appearances. However, when vertical results are combined with ordinary ones, significant differences in presentation may lead to user behavior biases and thus failure of state-of-the-art click models. With the help of a popular commercial search engine in China, we collected a large scale log data set which contains behavior information on both vertical and ordinary results. We also performed eye-tracking analysis to study user's real-world examining behavior. According these analysis, we found that different result appearances may cause different behavior biases both for vertical results (local effect) and for the whole result lists (global effect). These biases include: examine bias for vertical results (especially those with multimedia components), trust bias for result lists with vertical results, and a higher probability of result revisitation for vertical results. Based on these findings, a novel click model considering these biases besides position bias was constructed to describe interaction with SERPs containing verticals. Experimental results show that the new Vertical-aware Click Model (VCM) is better at interpreting user click behavior on federated searches in terms of both log-likelihood and perplexity than existing models.},

@inproceedings{Hasibi:2013:IQO:2484028.2484234,
 abstract = {Structural information retrieval is mostly based on hierarchy. However, in real life information is not purely hierarchical and structural elements may overlap each other. The most common example is a document with two distinct structural views, where the logical view is section/ subsection/ paragraph and the physical view is page/ line. Each single structural view of this document is a hierarchy and the components are either disjoint or nested inside each other. The overlapping issue arises when one structural element cannot be neatly nested into others. For instance, when a paragraph starts in one page and terminates in the next page. Similar situations can appear in videos and other multimedia contents, where temporal or spatial constituents of a media file may overlap each other. Querying over overlapping structures is one of the challenges of large scale search engines. For instance, FSIS (FAST Search for Internet Sites) [1] is a Microsoft search platform, which encounters overlaps while analysing content of textual data. FSIS uses a pipeline process to extract structure and semantic information of documents. The pipeline contains several components, where each component writes annotations to the input data. These annotations consist of structural elements and some of them may overlap each other. Handling overlapping structures in search engines will add a novel capability of searching, where users can ask queries such as "Find all the words that overlap two lines" or "Find the music played during Intro scene of Avatar movie". There are also other use cases, where the user of the search engine is not a person, but is a specific program with complex, non-traditional information retrieval needs. This research attempts to index overlapping structures and provide efficient query processing for large-scale search engines. The current research on overlapping structures revolves around encoding and modelling data, while indexing and query processing methods need investigations. Moreover, due to intrinsic complexity of overlaps, XML indexing and query processing techniques cannot be used for overlapping structures. Hence, my research on overlapping structures comprises three main parts: (1) an indexing method that supports both hierarchies and overlaps; (2) a query processing method based on the indexing technique and (3) a query language that is close to natural language and supports both full text and structural queries. Our approach for indexing overlaps is to adapt the PrePost [3] XML indexing method to overlapping structures. This method labels each node with its start and end positions and requires modest storage space. However, PrePost indexing cannot be used for overlapping nodes. To overcome this issue, we need to define a data model for overlapping structures. Since hierarchies are not sufficient to describe overlapping components, several data structures have been introduced by scholars. One of the most interesting data models is GODDAG [2]. GODDAG is a tree-like graph, where nodes can have multiple parentage. This model can support overlaps as well as simple inheritance. Our proposed data model for indexing overlaps is such a tree-like structure, where we can define overlapping, parent-child and ancestor-descendant relationships.},

We design a Gibbs sampling algorithm to learn the receptiveness and interest distributions among users over time. The results of experiments on a real world dataset demonstrate that RTM-based recommendation outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

 abstract = {n-gram representations of documents may improve over a simple bag-of-word representation by relaxing the independence assumption of word and introducing context. However, this comes at a cost of adding features which are non-descriptive, and increasing the dimension of the vector space model exponentially. We present new representations that avoid both pitfalls. They are based on sound theoretical notions of stringology, and can be computed in optimal asymptotic time with algorithms using data structures from the suffix family. While maximal repeats have been used in the past for similar tasks, we show how another equivalence class of repeats -- largest-maximal repeats -- obtain similar or better results, with only a fraction of the features. This class acts as a minimal generative basis of all repeated substrings. We also report their use for topic modeling, showing easier to interpret models.},

 abstract = {In recent years, a number of open databases have emerged on the Web, providing Web users with platforms to collaboratively create structured information. As these databases are intended to accommodate heterogeneous information and knowledge, they usually comprise a very large schema and billions of instances. Browsing and searching data on such a scale is not an easy task for a Web user. In this context, interactive query construction offers an intuitive interface for novice users to retrieve information from databases neither requiring any knowledge of structured query languages, nor any prior knowledge of the database schema. However, the existing mechanisms do not scale well on large scale datasets. This paper presents a set of techniques to boost the scalability of interactive query construction, from the perspective of both, user interaction cost and performance. We connect an abstract ontology layer to the database schema to shorten the process of user-computer interaction. We also introduce a search mechanism to enable efficient exploration of query interpretation spaces over large scale data. Extensive experiments show that our approach scales well on Freebase - an open database containing more than 7,000 relational tables in more than 100 domains.},

 abstract = {High quality relevance judgments are essential for the evaluation of information retrieval systems. Traditional methods of collecting relevance judgments are based on collecting binary or graded nominal judgments, but such judgments are limited by factors such as inter-assessor disagreement and the arbitrariness of grades. Previous research has shown that it is easier for assessors to make pairwise preference judgments. However, unless the preferences collected are largely transitive, it is not clear how to combine them in order to obtain document relevance scores. Another difficulty is that the number of pairs that need to be assessed is quadratic in the number of documents. In this work, we consider the problem of inferring document relevance scores from pairwise preference judgments by analogy to tournaments using the Elo rating system. We show how to combine a linear number of pairwise preference judgments from multiple assessors to compute relevance scores for every document.},

 abstract = {Web content increasingly reflects the current state of the physical and social world, manifested both in traditional news media sources along with user-generated publishing sites such as Twitter, Foursquare, and Facebook. At the same time, web searching increasingly reflects problems grounded in the real world. As a result of this blending of the web with the real world, we observe that the web, both in its composition and use, has incorporated many of the dynamics of the real world. Few of the problems associated with searching dynamic collections are well understood, such as defining time-sensitive relevance, understanding user query behavior over time and understanding why certain web content changes. We believe that, just as static collections often benefit from modeling topics, dynamic collections will likely benefit from temporal modeling of events and time-sensitive user interests and intents, which were rarely addressed in the literature. There have been preliminary efforts in the research and industrial communities to address algorithms, architectures, evaluation methodologies and metrics. We aim to bring together practitioners and researchers to discuss their recent breakthroughs and the challenges with addressing time-aware information access, both from the algorithmic and the architectural perspectives. This workshop is a successor to the successful SIGIR 2012 Workshop on Time Aware Information Access (#TAIA2012).

The second stage is to run a set of tasks where each task compares a partition of vectors with other candidate partitions. Because of data sparsity, accessing feature vectors in memory for runtime comparison in the second stage, incurs significant overhead due to the presence of memory hierarchy. This paper proposes a cache-conscious data layout and traversal optimization to reduce the execution time through size-controlled data splitting and vector coalescing. It also provides an analysis to guide the optimal choice for the parameter setting. Our evaluation with several application datasets verifies the performance gains obtained by the optimization and shows that the proposed scheme is upto 2.74x as fast as the cache-oblivious baseline.},

 abstract = {Time is often important for understanding user intent during search activity, especially for information needs related to event-driven topics. Diversity for multi-faceted information needs ensures that ranked documents optimally cover multiple facets when a user's intent is uncertain. Effective diversity is reliant on methods to (i) discover and represent facets, and (ii) determine how likely each facet is the user's intent (i.e., its popularity). Past work has developed several techniques addressing these issues, however, they have concentrated on static approaches which do not consider the temporal nature of new and evolving intents and their popularity. In many cases, what a user expects may change dramatically over time as events develop. In this work we study the temporal variance of search intents for event-driven information needs using Wikipedia. First, we model intents based upon the structure represented by the section hierarchy of Wikipedia articles closely related to the information need. Using this technique, we investigate whether temporal changes in the content structure, i.e. in a section's text, reflect the temporal popularity of the intent. We map intents taken from a query-log (as ground-truth) to Wikipedia article sections and found that a large proportion are indeed reflected in topic-related article structure. By correlating the change activity of each section with the use of the intent query over time, we found that section change activity does reflect temporal popularity of many intents. Furthermore, we show that popularity between intents changes over time for event-driven topics.},

 abstract = {Query-biased search result summaries, or "snippets", help users decide whether a result is relevant for their information need, and have become increasingly important for helping searchers with difficult or ambiguous search tasks. Previously published snippet generation algorithms have been primarily based on selecting document fragments most similar to the query, which does not take into account which parts of the document the searchers actually found useful. We present a new approach to improving result summaries by incorporating post-click searcher behavior data, such as mouse cursor movements and scrolling over the result documents. To achieve this aim, we develop a method for collecting behavioral data with precise association between searcher intent, document examination behavior, and the corresponding document fragments. In turn, this allows us to incorporate page examination behavior signals into a novel Behavior-Biased Snippet generation system (BeBS). By mining searcher examination data, BeBS infers document fragments of most interest to users, and combines this evidence with text-based features to select the most promising fragments for inclusion in the result summary. Our extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our method improves the quality of result summaries compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We believe that this work opens a new direction for improving search result presentation, and we make available the code and the search behavior data used in this study to encourage further research in this area.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of long-term language change in information retrieval (IR) systems. IR research has often ignored lexical drift. But in the emerging domain of massive digitized book collections, the risk of vocabulary mismatch due to language change is high. Collections such as Google Books and the Hathi Trust contain text written in the vernaculars of many centuries. With respect to IR, changes in vocabulary and orthography make 14th-Century English qualitatively different from 21st-Century English. This challenges retrieval models that rely on keyword matching. With this challenge in mind, we ask: given a query written in contemporary English, how can we retrieve relevant documents that were written in early English? We argue that search in historically diverse corpora is similar to cross-language retrieval (CLIR). By considering "modern" English and "archaic" English as distinct languages, CLIR techniques can improve what we call cross-temporal IR (CTIR). We focus on ways to combine evidence to improve CTIR effectiveness, proposing and testing several ways to handle language change during book search. We find that a principled combination of three sources of evidence during relevance feedback yields strong CTIR performance.},

Sham documents are often ranked artificially high in response to certain queries, but also may contain some useful information and cannot be considered as absolute spam. We report a novel annotation effort performed with the ClueWeb09 benchmark where pages were labeled as being spam, sham, or legitimate content. Significant inter-annotator agreement rates support the claim that there are sham documents that are highly ranked by a very effective retrieval approach, yet are not spam. We also present an initial study of predictors that may indicate whether a query is the target of shamming.},

 abstract = {News reporting has seen a shift toward fast-paced online reporting in new sources such as social media. Web Search engines that support a news vertical have historically relied upon articles published by major newswire providers when serving news-related queries. In this paper, we investigate to what extent real-time content from newswire, blogs, Twitter and Wikipedia sources are useful to return to the user in the current fast-paced news search setting. In particular, we perform a detailed user study using the emerging medium of crowdsourcing to determine when and where integrating news-related content from these various sources can better serve the user's news need. We sampled approximately 300 news-related search queries using Google Trends and Bitly data in real-time for two time periods. For these queries, we have crowdsourced workers compare Web search rankings for each, with similar rankings integrating real-time news content from sources such as Twitter or the blogosphere. Our results show that users exhibited a preference for rankings integrating newswire articles for only half of our queries, indicating that relying solely on newswire providers for news-related content is now insufficient. Moreover, our results show that users preferred rankings that integrate tweets more often than those that integrate newswire articles, showing the potential of using social media to better serve news queries.},

(2) Character candidates are grouped into text candidates by the single-link clustering algorithm, where distance weights and threshold of clustering are learned automatically by a novel self-training distance metric learning algorithm.

While the criteria by which assessors? judge relevance has been intensively studied, little work has investigated the process individual assessors go through to judge the relevance of a document. In this paper, we focus on the process by which relevance is judged, and in particular, the degree of effort a user must expend to judge relevance. By better understanding this effort in isolation, we may provide data which can be used to create better models of search. We present the results of an empirical evaluation of the effort users must exert to judge the relevance of document, investigating the effect of relevance level and document size. Results suggest that 'relevant' documents require more effort to judge when compared to highly relevant and not relevant documents, and that effort increases as document size increases.},

We apply our findings to construct a statistical model that can predict with high accuracy whether a user will be soon observed at an address that had been recently retrieved via search.

 abstract = {As a tremendous number of mobile applications (apps) are readily available, users have difficulty in identifying apps that are relevant to their interests. Recommender systems that depend on previous user ratings (i.e., collaborative filtering, or CF) can address this problem for apps that have sufficient ratings from past users. But for apps that are newly released, CF does not have any user ratings to base recommendations on, which leads to the cold-start problem. In this paper, we describe a method that accounts for nascent information culled from Twitter to provide relevant recommendation in such cold-start situations. We use Twitter handles to access an app's Twitter account and extract the IDs of their Twitter-followers. We create pseudo-documents that contain the IDs of Twitter users interested in an app and then apply latent Dirichlet allocation to generate latent groups. At test time, a target user seeking recommendations is mapped to these latent groups. By using the transitive relationship of latent groups to apps, we estimate the probability of the user liking the app. We show that by incorporating information from Twitter, our approach overcomes the difficulty of cold-start app recommendation and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art recommendation techniques by up to 33%.},

One of the main objectives in clinical IR is to fill the semantic gap among the queries and documents and go beyond keywords matching. To address these issues, in this paper we attempt to use semantic information to improve the performance of clinical IR systems by representing queries in an expressive and meaningful context. To model a query context initially we model and develop query domain ontology. The query domain ontology represents concepts closely related with query concepts. Query context represents concepts extracted from query domain ontology and weighted according to their semantic relatedness to query concept(s). The query context is then exploited in query expansion and patients records re-ranking for improving clinical retrieval performance. We evaluate our approach on the TREC Medical Records dataset. Results show that our proposed approach significantly improves the retrieval performance compare to classic keyword-based IR model.},

 abstract = {Most of existing e-commerce recommender systems aim to recommend the right product to a user, based on whether the user is likely to purchase or like a product. On the other hand, the effectiveness of recommendations also depends on the time of the recommendation. Let us take a user who just purchased a laptop as an example. She may purchase a replacement battery in 2 years (assuming that the laptop's original battery often fails to work around that time) and purchase a new laptop in another 2 years. In this case, it is not a good idea to recommend a new laptop or a replacement battery right after the user purchased the new laptop. It could hurt the user's satisfaction of the recommender system if she receives a potentially right product recommendation at the wrong time. We argue that a system should not only recommend the most relevant item, but also recommend at the right time. This paper studies the new problem: how to recommend the right product at the right time? We adapt the proportional hazards modeling approach in survival analysis to the recommendation research field and propose a new opportunity model to explicitly incorporate time in an e-commerce recommender system. The new model estimates the joint probability of a user making a follow-up purchase of a particular product at a particular time. This joint purchase probability can be leveraged by recommender systems in various scenarios, including the zero-query pull-based recommendation scenario (e.g. recommendation on an e-commerce web site) and a proactive push-based promotion scenario (e.g. email or text message based marketing). We evaluate the opportunity modeling approach with multiple metrics. Experimental results on a data collected by a real-world e-commerce website(shop.com) show that it can predict a user's follow-up purchase behavior at a particular time with descent accuracy. In addition, the opportunity model significantly improves the conversion rate in pull-based systems and the user satisfaction/utility in push-based systems.},

 abstract = {Search engines train and apply a single ranking model across all users, but searchers' information needs are diverse and cover a broad range of topics. Hence, a single user-independent ranking model is insufficient to satisfy different users' result preferences. Conventional personalization methods learn separate models of user interests and use those to re-rank the results from the generic model. Those methods require significant user history information to learn user preferences, have low coverage in the case of memory-based methods that learn direct associations between query-URL pairs, and have limited opportunity to markedly affect the ranking given that they only re-order top-ranked items. In this paper, we propose a general ranking model adaptation framework for personalized search. Using a given user-independent ranking model trained offline and limited number of adaptation queries from individual users, the framework quickly learns to apply a series of linear transformations, e.g., scaling and shifting, over the parameters of the given global ranking model such that the adapted model can better fit each individual user's search preferences. Extensive experimentation based on a large set of search logs from a major commercial Web search engine confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art ranking model adaptation methods.},

In contrast to the majority of the state-of-the-art topic models, our model does not break the document's structure such as paragraphs and sentences. In addition, it preserves word order in the document. As a result, it can generate two levels of topics of different granularity, namely, segment-topics and word-topics. In addition, it can generate n-gram words in each topic. We also develop an approximate inference scheme using Gibbs sampling method. We conduct extensive experiments using publicly available data from different collections and show that our model improves the quality of several text mining tasks such as the ability to support fine grained topics with n-gram words in the correlation graph, the ability to segment a document into topically coherent sections, document classification, and document likelihood estimation.},

However, even though different search intents behind a given query may have been popular at different time periods in the past, existing query suggestion methods neither utilize nor present such information. In this study, we propose Time-aware Structured Query Suggestion (TaSQS) which clusters query suggestions along a timeline so that the user can narrow down his search from a temporal point of view. Moreover, when a suggested query is clicked, TaSQS presents web pages from query-URL bipartite graphs after ranking them according to the click counts within a particular time period. Our experiments using data from a commercial search engine log show that the time-aware clustering and the time-aware document ranking features of TaSQS are both effective.},

However, the proposed methods have a number of limitations. In particular, they run on a single snapshot of a user browsing graph ignoring substantially dynamic nature of user browsing activity, which makes such methods recency unaware. This paper proposes a new method for computing page importance, referred to as Fresh BrowseRank. The score of a page by our algorithm equals to the weight in a stationary distribution of a flexible random walk, which is controlled by recency-sensitive weights of vertices and edges. Our method generalizes some previous approaches, provides better capability for capturing the dynamics of the Web and users behavior, and overcomes essential limitations of BrowseRank. The experimental results demonstrate that our method enables to achieve more relevant and fresh ranking results than the classic BrowseRank.},

 abstract = {The task of Question Answering (QA) is to find correct answers to users' questions expressed in natural language. In the last few years non-factoid QA received more attention. It focuses on causation, manner and reason questions, where the expected answer has the form of a passage of text. The presence of question and answers corpora allows the adoption of Learning to Rank (MLR) algorithms in order to out- put a sensible ranking of the candidate answers. The importance and effectiveness of linguistically motivated features, obtained from syntax, lexical semantics and semantic role labeling, was shown in literature [2-4], but there are still several different possible semantic features that have not been taken into account so far and our goal is to find out if their use could lead to performance improvement. In particular features coming from Semantic Models (SM) like Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs), Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) induced topics have never been applied to the task so far. Based on the usefulness that those models show in other tasks, we think that SM can have a significant role in improving current state-of-the-art systems' performance in answer re-ranking. The questions this research wants to answer are: 1) Do semantic features bring information that is not present in the bag-of-words and syntactic features? 2) Do they bring different information or does it overlap with that of other features? 3) Are additional semantic features useful for answer re-ranking? Does their adoption improve systems' performance? 4) Which of them is more effective and under which circumstances? We performed a preliminary evaluation of DSMs on the ResPubliQA 2010 Dataset. We built a DSM based answer scorer that represents the question and the answer as the sums of the vectors of their terms taken term-term co-occurrence matrix and calculates their cosine similarity. We replaced the term-term matrix with the ones obtained by Random Indexing (RI), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and LSA over the RI. Considering each DSM on its own, the results prove that all the DSMs are better than the baseline (the standard term-term co-occurrence matrix), and the improvement is always significant. The best improvement for the MRR in English is obtained by LSA (+180%), while in Italian by LSARI (+161%). We also showed that combining the DSMs with overlap based measures via CombSum the ranking is significantly better than the baseline obtained by the overlap measures alone. For English we have obtained an improvement in MRR of about 16% and for Italian, we achieve a even higher improvement in MRR of 26%. Finally, adopting RankNet for combining the overlap features and the DSMs features, improves the MRR of about 13%. More details can be found in [1]. In order to investigate the effectiveness of the semantic features, we still need to incorporate other semantic features, such as ESA, LDA and other state-of-the-art linguistic features. Other operators for semantic compositionality, like product, tensor product and circular convolution, will also be investigated. Moreover we will experiment on different datasets, focus- ing mainly on non-factoid QA. The Yahoo! Answers Manner Questions datasets are a good starting point. A new dataset will also be collected with questions from the users of Wikiedi (a QA system over Wikipedia articles, www.wikiedi.it) and answers in the form of paragraphs from Wikipedia pages.},

In addition, some information retrieval evaluation metrics have been built on top of a user model. In this paper we bring these two directions together and propose a common approach to converting any click model into an evaluation metric. We then put the resulting model-based metrics as well as traditional metrics (like DCG or Precision) into a common evaluation framework and compare them along a number of dimensions. One of the dimensions we are particularly interested in is the agreement between offline and online experimental outcomes. It is widely believed, especially in an industrial setting, that online A/B-testing and interleaving experiments are generally better at capturing system quality than offline measurements. We show that offline metrics that are based on click models are more strongly correlated with online experimental outcomes than traditional offline metrics, especially in situations when we have incomplete relevance judgements.},

In order to help other users to find out the major opinion about a given topic, without the effort to read several reviews, multi-document summarisation is required. This research proposes an approach for extractive summarisation, supporting different scoring techniques, such as cosine similarity or divergence, as a method for finding representative sentences. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of an algorithm for sentence removal, developed to maximise the score between the summary and the original document. Instead of ranking the sentences and selecting the most important ones, the algorithm iteratively removes unimportant sentences until a desired compression rate is reached. Experimental results show that variations of the sentence removal algorithm provide good performance.},

@inproceedings{Aktolga:2013:SDD:2484028.2484060,
 abstract = {Prior search result diversification work focuses on achieving topical variety in a ranked list, typically equally across all aspects. In this paper, we diversify with sentiments according to an explicit bias. We want to allow users to switch the result perspective to better grasp the polarity of opinionated content, such as during a literature review. For this, we first infer the prior sentiment bias inherent in a controversial topic -- the 'Topic Sentiment'. Then, we utilize this information in 3 different ways to diversify results according to various sentiment biases: (1) Equal diversification to achieve a balanced and unbiased representation of all sentiments on the topic; (2) Diversification towards the Topic Sentiment, in which the actual sentiment bias in the topic is mirrored to emphasize the general perception of the topic; (3) Diversification against the Topic Sentiment, in which documents about the 'minority' or outlying sentiment(s) are boosted and those with the popular sentiment are demoted. Since sentiment classification is an essential tool for this task, we experiment by gradually degrading the accuracy of a perfect classifier down to 40%, and show which diversification approaches prove most stable in this setting. The results reveal that the proportionality-based methods and our SCSF model, considering sentiment strength and frequency in the diversified list, yield the highest gains. Further, in case the Topic Sentiment cannot be reliably estimated, we show how performance is affected by equal diversification when actually an emphasis either towards or against the Topic Sentiment is desired: in the former case, an average of 6.48% is lost across all evaluation measures, whereas in the latter case this is 16.23%, confirming that bias-specific sentiment diversification is crucial.},

 abstract = {Traditional information retrieval (IR) models use bag-of-words as the basic representation and assume that some form of independence holds between terms. Representing term dependencies and defining a scoring function capable of integrating such additional evidence is theoretically and practically challenging. Recently, Quantum Theory (QT) has been proposed as a possible, more general framework for IR. However, only a limited number of investigations have been made and the potential of QT has not been fully explored and tested. We develop a new, generalized Language Modeling approach for IR by adopting the probabilistic framework of QT. In particular, quantum probability could account for both single and compound terms at once without having to extend the term space artificially as in previous studies. This naturally allows us to avoid the weight-normalization problem, which arises in the current practice by mixing scores from matching compound terms and from matching single terms. Our model is the first practical application of quantum probability to show significant improvements over a robust bag-of-words baseline and achieves better performance on a stronger non bag-of-words baseline.},

Our goal is to build a system for retrieving bar charts and line graphs that reasons about the content of the graphic itself in deciding its relevance to the user query. This paper presents the first steps toward such a system, with a focus on identifying the category of intended message of potentially relevant bar charts and line graphs. Our learned model achieves accuracy higher than 80\% on a corpus of collected user queries.},

 abstract = {It's well known that the transitivity of friendship is a popular sociological principle in social networks. However, it's still unknown that to what extent people's friend-making behaviors follow this principle and to what extent it can benefit the link prediction task. In this paper, we try to adopt this sociological principle to explain the evolution of networks and study the latent friendship propagation. Unlike traditional link prediction approaches, we model link formation as results of individuals' friend-making behaviors combined with personal interests. We propose the Latent Friendship Propagation Network (LFPN), which depicts the evolution progress of one's egocentric network and reveals future growth potentials driven by the transitivity of friendship based on personal interests. We model individuals' social behaviors using the Latent Friendship Propagation Model (LFPM), a probabilistic generative model from which the LFPN can be learned effectively. To evaluate the power of the friendship propagation in link prediction, we design LFPN-RW which models the friend-making behavior as a random walk upon the LFPN naturally and captures the co-influence effect of the friend circles as well as personal interests to provide more accurate prediction. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that LFPN-RW outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. This convinces that the transitivity of friendship actually plays important roles in the evolution of social networks.},

 abstract = {Pseudo-relevance feedback is an important strategy to improve search accuracy. It is often implemented as a two-round retrieval process: the first round is to retrieve an initial set of documents relevant to an original query, and the second round is to retrieve final retrieval results using the original query expanded with terms selected from the previously retrieved documents. This two-round retrieval process is clearly time consuming, which could arguably be one of main reasons that hinder the wide adaptation of the pseudo-relevance feedback methods in real-world IR systems. In this paper, we study how to improve the efficiency of pseudo-relevance feedback methods. The basic idea is to reduce the time needed for the second round of retrieval by leveraging the query processing results of the first round. Specifically, instead of processing the expand query as a newly submitted query, we propose an incremental approach, which resumes the query processing results (i.e. document accumulators) for the first round of retrieval and process the second round of retrieval mainly as a step of adjusting the scores in the accumulators. Experimental results on TREC Terabyte collections show that the proposed incremental approach can improve the efficiency of pseudo-relevance feedback methods by a factor of two without sacrificing their effectiveness.},

 abstract = {When generating query recommendations for a user, a natural approach is to try and leverage not only the user's most recently submitted query, or reference query, but also information about the current search context, such as the user's recent search interactions. We focus on two important classes of queries that make up search contexts: those that address the same information need as the reference query (on-task queries), and those that do not (off-task queries). We analyze the effects on query recommendation performance of using contexts consisting of only on-task queries, only off-task queries, and a mix of the two. Using TREC Session Track data for simulations, we demonstrate that on-task context is helpful on average but can be easily overwhelmed when off-task queries are interleaved---a common situation according to several analyses of commercial search logs. To minimize the impact of off-task queries on recommendation performance, we consider automatic methods of identifying such queries using a state of the art search task identification technique. Our experimental results show that automatic search task identification can eliminate the effect of off-task queries in a mixed context. We also introduce a novel generalized model for generating recommendations over a search context. While we only consider query text in this study, the model can handle integration over arbitrary user search behavior, such as page visits, dwell times, and query abandonment. In addition, it can be used for other types of recommendation, including personalized web search.},

 abstract = {Topic models are used to group words in a text dataset into a set of relevant topics. Unfortunately, when a few words frequently appear in a dataset, the topic groups identified by topic models become noisy because these frequent words repeatedly appear in "irrelevant" topic groups. This noise has not been a serious problem in a text dataset because the frequent words (e.g., the and is) do not have much meaning and have been simply removed before a topic model analysis. However, in a social network dataset we are interested in, they correspond to popular persons (e.g., Barack Obama and Justin Bieber) and cannot be simply removed because most people are interested in them. To solve this "popularity problem", we explicitly model the popularity of nodes (words) in topic models. For this purpose, we first introduce a notion of a "popularity component" and propose topic model extensions that effectively accommodate the popularity component. We evaluate the effectiveness of our models with a real-world Twitter dataset. Our proposed models achieve significantly lower perplexity (i.e., better prediction power) compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition to the popularity problem caused by the nodes with high incoming edge degree, we also investigate the effect of the outgoing edge degree with another topic model extensions. We show that considering outgoing edge degree does not help much in achieving lower perplexity.},

Tweets in its raw form can be incredibly informative, but also overwhelming. For both end-users and data analysts it is a nightmare to plow through millions of tweets which contain enormous noises and redundancies. In this paper, we study continuous tweet summarization as a solution to address this problem. While traditional document summarization methods focus on static and small-scale data, we aim to deal with dynamic, quickly arriving, and large-scale tweet streams. We propose a novel prototype called Sumblr (SUMmarization By stream cLusteRing) for tweet streams. We first propose an online tweet stream clustering algorithm to cluster tweets and maintain distilled statistics called Tweet Cluster Vectors. Then we develop a TCV-Rank summarization technique for generating online summaries and historical summaries of arbitrary time durations. Finally, we describe a topic evolvement detection method, which consumes online and historical summaries to produce timelines automatically from tweet streams. Our experiments on large-scale real tweets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.},

As far as we know, no analysis has been made yet on the evaluation of these tasks from a global perspective. In this paper we propose two complementary evaluation measures -- Reliability and Sensitivity -- for the generic Document Organization task which are derived from a proposed set of formal constraints (properties that any suitable measure must satisfy). In addition to be the first measures that can be applied to any mixture of ranking, clustering and filtering tasks, Reliability and Sensitivity satisfy more formal constraints than previously existing evaluation metrics for each of the subsumed tasks. Besides their formal properties, its most salient feature from an empirical point of view is their strictness: a high score according to the harmonic mean of Reliability and Sensitivity ensures a high score with any of the most popular evaluation metrics in all the Document Retrieval, Clustering and Filtering datasets used in our experiments.},

In order to take advantage of the large number of photos and videos that do not contain (GPS-based) latitude/longitude coordinates, a number of approaches have been proposed to estimate the geographic location where they were taken. Such location estimation methods rely on existing geotagged multimedia items as training data. Across application and usage scenarios, it is commonly assumed that the available geotagged items contain (reasonably) accurate latitude/longitude coordinates. Here, we consider this assumption and investigate how accurate the provided location data is. We conduct a study of Flickr images and videos and find that the accuracy of the geotag information is highly dependent on the popularity of the location: images/videos taken at popular (unpopular) locations, are likely to be geotagged with a high (low) degree of accuracy with respect to the ground truth.},

We also examine how \defineterm{need for cognition}, an individual difference measure of the extent to which a person enjoys engaging in effortful cognitive activity, impacts relevance assessments.

 abstract = {The complexity of medical terminology raises challenges when searching medical records. For example, 'cancer', 'tumour', and 'neoplasms', which are synonyms, may prevent a traditional search system from retrieving relevant records that contain only synonyms of the query terms. Prior works use bag-of-concepts approaches, to deal with this by representing medical terms sharing the same meanings using concepts from medical resources (e.g. MeSH). The relevance scores are then combined with a traditional bag-of-words representation, when inferring the relevance of medical records. Even though the existing approaches are effective, the predicted retrieval effectiveness of either the bag-of-words or bag-of-concepts representation, which may be used to effectively model the score combination and hence improve retrieval performance, is not taken into account. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework that models the importance of the bag-of-words and the bag-of-concepts representations, combining their scores on a per-query basis. Our proposed framework leverages retrieval performance predictors, such as the clarity score and AvIDF, calculated on both representations as learning features. We evaluate our proposed framework using the TREC Medical Records track's test collections. As our proposed framework can significantly outperform an existing approach that linearly merges the relevance scores, we conclude that retrieval performance predictors can be effectively leveraged when combining the relevance scores.},

Current solutions to this challenge are often inconsistent with the formal probabilistic framework in which constituent scores were estimated, or use sophisticated learning methods that make it difficult for humans to understand the origin of the final ranking. To address these issues, we introduce the use of copulas, a powerful statistical framework for modeling complex multi-dimensional dependencies, to information retrieval tasks. We provide a formal background to copulas and demonstrate their effectiveness on standard IR tasks such as combining multidimensional relevance estimates and fusion of results from multiple search engines. We introduce copula-based versions of standard relevance estimators and fusion methods and show that these lead to significant performance improvements on several tasks, as evaluated on large-scale standard corpora, compared to their non-copula counterparts. We also investigate criteria for understanding the likely effect of using copula models in a given retrieval scenario.},

Depending on previous user interaction with the repeated results, and the details of the session, we show that sometimes the repeated results should be promoted, while some other times they should be demoted. Analysing search logs from two different commercial search engines, we find that results are repeated in about 40% of multi-query search sessions, and that users engage differently with repeats than with results shown for the first time. We demonstrate how statistics about result repetition within search sessions can be incorporated into ranking for personalizing search results. Our results on query logs of two large-scale commercial search engines suggest that we successfully promote documents that are more likely to be clicked by the user in the future while maintaining performance over standard measures of non-personalized relevance.},

 abstract = {In information retrieval, we are interested in the information that is not only relevant but also novel. In this paper, we study how to boost novelty for biomedical information retrieval through probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We conduct the study based on TREC Genomics Track data. In TREC Genomics Track, each topic is considered to have an arbitrary number of aspects, and the novelty of a piece of information retrieved, called a passage, is assessed based on the amount of new aspects it contains. In particular, the aspect performance of a ranked list is rewarded by the number of new aspects reached at each rank and penalized by the amount of irrelevant passages that are rated higher than the novel ones. Therefore, to improve aspect performance, we should reach as many aspects as possible and as early as possible. In this paper, we make a preliminary study on how probabilistic latent semantic analysis can help capture different aspects of a ranked list, and improve its performance by re-ranking. Experiments indicate that the proposed approach can greatly improve the aspect-level performance over baseline algorithm Okapi BM25.},

 abstract = {Document expansion (DE) in information retrieval (IR) involves modifying each document in the collection by introducing additional terms into the document. It is particularly useful to improve retrieval of short and noisy documents where the additional terms can improve the description of the document content. Existing approaches to DE assume that documents to be expanded are from a single topic. In the case of multi-topic documents this can lead to a topic bias in terms selected for DE and hence may result in poor retrieval quality due to the lack of coverage of the original document topics in the expanded document. This paper proposes a new DE technique providing a more uniform selection and weighting of DE terms from all constituent topics. We show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the most recently reported relevance model based DE method on a spoken document retrieval task for both manual and automatic speech recognition transcripts.},

In many cases, users are reluctant to explicitly express their preferences and many recommender systems have to infer them from implicit user behaviors, such as clicking a link in a webpage or playing a music track. The clicks and the plays are good for indicating the items a user liked (i.e., positive training examples), but the items a user did not like (negative training examples) are not directly observed. Previous approaches either randomly pick negative training samples from unseen items or incorporate some heuristics into the learning model, leading to a biased solution and a prolonged training period. In this paper, we propose to dynamically choose negative training samples from the ranked list produced by the current prediction model and iteratively update our model. The experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets show that our approach not only reduces the training time, but also leads to significant performance gains.},

Traditional friend recommendation methods in social media mainly focus on a user's social need, but seldom address their informational need (i.e. suggesting friends that can provide information one may be interested in but have not been able to obtain so far). In this paper, we propose to recommend friends according to the informational utility, which stands for the degree to which a friend satisfies the target user's unfulfilled informational need, called informational friend recommendation. In order to capture users' informational need, we view a post in social media as an item and utilize collaborative filtering techniques to predict the rating for each post. The candidate friends are then ranked according to their informational utility for recommendation. In addition, we also show how to further consider diversity in such recommendations. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach can significantly outperform the traditional friend recommendation methods under informational evaluation measures.},

It is intrinsically related to retrieval performance because a document needs to be retrieved before it can be judged relevant. In this paper, we undertake an empirical investigation into the relationship between the retrievability of documents, the retrieval bias imposed by a retrieval system, and the retrieval performance, across different amounts of document length normalization. To this end, two standard IR models are used on three TREC test collections to show that there is a useful and practical link between retrievability and performance. Our findings show that minimizing the bias across the document collection leads to good performance (though not the best performance possible). We also show that past a certain amount of document length normalization the retrieval bias increases, and the retrieval performance significantly and rapidly decreases. These findings suggest that the relationship between retrievability and effectiveness may offer a way to automatically tune systems.},

 abstract = {Query suggestion or auto-completion mechanisms are widely used by search engines and are increasingly attracting interest from the research community. However, the lack of commonly accepted evaluation methodology and metrics means that it is not possible to compare results and approaches from the literature. Moreover, often the metrics used to evaluate query suggestions tend to be an adaptation from other domains without a proper justification. Hence, it is not necessarily clear if the improvements reported in the literature would result in an actual improvement in the users' experience. Inspired by the cascade user models and state-of-the-art evaluation metrics in the web search domain, we address the query suggestion evaluation, by first studying the users behaviour from a search engine's query log and thereby deriving a new family of user models describing the users interaction with a query suggestion mechanism. Next, assuming a query log-based evaluation approach, we propose two new metrics to evaluate query suggestions, pSaved and eSaved. Both metrics are parameterised by a user model. pSaved is defined as the probability of using the query suggestions while submitting a query. eSaved equates to the expected relative amount of effort (keypresses) a user can avoid due to the deployed query suggestion mechanism. Finally, we experiment with both metrics using four user model instantiations as well as metrics previously used in the literature on a dataset of 6.1M sessions. Our results demonstrate that pSaved and eSaved show the best alignment with the users satisfaction amongst the considered metrics.},

 abstract = {Modern search engines make extensive use of people's contextual information to finesse result rankings. Using a searcher's location provides an especially strong signal for adjusting results for certain classes of queries where people may have clear preference for local results, without explicitly specifying the location in the query direct-ly. However, if the location estimate is inaccurate or searchers want to obtain many results from a particular location, they have limited control on the location focus in the search results returned. In this paper we describe a user study that examines the effect of offering searchers more control over how local preferences are gathered and used. We studied providing users with functionality to offer explicit relevance feedback (ERF) adjacent to results automatically identi-fied as location-dependent (i.e., more from this location). They can use this functionality to indicate whether they are interested in a particular search result and desire more results from that result's location. We compared the ERF system against a baseline (NoERF) that used the same underlying mechanisms to retrieve and rank results, but did not offer ERF support. User performance was as-sessed across 12 experimental participants over 12 location-sensitive topics, in a fully counter-balanced design. We found that participants interacted with ERF frequently, and there were signs that ERF has the potential to improve success rates and lead to more efficient searching for location-sensitive search tasks than NoERF.},

 abstract = {Patent prior art search is a task in patent retrieval where the goal is to rank documents which describe prior art work related to a patent application. One of the main properties of patent retrieval is that the query topic is a full patent application and does not represent a focused information need. This query by document nature of patent retrieval introduces new challenges and requires new investigations specific to this problem. Researchers have addressed this problem by considering different information resources for query reduction and query disambiguation. However, previous work has not fully studied the effect of using proximity information and exploiting domain specific resources for performing query disambiguation. In this paper, we first reduce the query document by taking the first claim of the document itself. We then build a query-specific patent lexicon based on definitions of the International Patent Classification (IPC). We study how to expand queries by selecting expansion terms from the lexicon that are focused on the query topic. The key problem is how to capture whether an expansion term is focused on the query topic or not. We address this problem by exploiting proximity information. We assign high weights to expansion terms appearing closer to query terms based on the intuition that terms closer to query terms are more likely to be related to the query topic. Experimental results on two patent retrieval datasets show that the proposed method is effective and robust for query expansion, significantly outperforming the standard pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) and existing baselines in patent retrieval.},

In this paper, we tackle this open problem by investigating a search-based face annotation (SBFA) paradigm for mining large amounts of web facial images freely available on the WWW. Given a query facial image for annotation, the idea of SBFA is to first search for top-n similar facial images from a web facial image database and then exploit these top-ranked similar facial images and their weak labels for naming the query facial image. To fully mine those information, this paper proposes a novel framework of Learning to Name Faces (L2NF) -- a unified multimodal learning approach for search-based face annotation, which consists of the following major components: (i) we enhance the weak labels of top-ranked similar images by exploiting the "label smoothness" assumption; (ii) we construct the multimodal representations of a facial image by extracting different types of features; (iii) we optimize the distance measure for each type of features using distance metric learning techniques; and finally (iv) we learn the optimal combination of multiple modalities for annotation through a learning to rank scheme. We conduct a set of extensive empirical studies on two real-world facial image databases, in which encouraging results show that the proposed algorithms significantly boost the naming accuracy of search-based face annotation task.},

 abstract = {Current research on web search has focused on optimizing and evaluating single queries. However, a significant fraction of user queries are part of more complex tasks [20] which span multiple queries across one or more search sessions [26,24]. An ideal search engine would not only retrieve relevant results for a user's particular query but also be able to identify when the user is engaged in a more complex task and aid the user in completing that task [29,1]. Toward optimizing whole-session or task relevance, we characterize and address the problem of intrinsic diversity (ID) in retrieval [30], a type of complex task that requires multiple interactions with current search engines. Unlike existing work on extrinsic diversity [30] that deals with ambiguity in intent across multiple users, ID queries often have little ambiguity in intent but seek content covering a variety of aspects on a shared theme. In such scenarios, the underlying needs are typically exploratory, comparative, or breadth-oriented in nature. We identify and address three key problems for ID retrieval: identifying authentic examples of ID tasks from post-hoc analysis of behavioral signals in search logs; learning to identify initiator queries that mark the start of an ID search task; and given an initiator query, predicting which content to prefetch and rank.},

 abstract = {Logic-based Information Retrieval (IR) models represent the retrieval decision as a logical implication d->q between a document d and a query q, where d and q are logical sentences. However, d->q is a binary decision, we thus need a measure to estimate the degree to which d implies q, denoted P(d->q). In this study, we revisit the Van Rijsbergen's assumptions about: 1- the logical implication ->' is not the material one, and 2- P(d->q) could be estimated by the conditional probability P(q|d). More precisely, we claim that the material implication is an appropriate implication for IR, and also we mathematically prove that replacing P(d->q) by P(q|d) is a correct choice. In order to prove the Van Rijsbergen's assumption, we use the Propositional Logic and the Lattice theory. We also exploit the notion of degree of implication that is proposed by Knuth.},

 abstract = {Random Walk with Restart (RWR) has become an appealing measure of node proximities in emerging applications \eg recommender systems and automatic image captioning. In practice, a real graph is typically large, and is frequently updated with small changes. It is often cost-inhibitive to recompute proximities from scratch via \emph{batch} algorithms when the graph is updated. This paper focuses on the incremental computations of RWR in a dynamic graph, whose edges often change over time. The prior attempt of RWR [1] deploys \kdash to find top-$k$ highest proximity nodes for a given query, which involves a strategy to incrementally \emph{estimate} upper proximity bounds. However, due to its aim to prune needless calculation, such an incremental strategy is \emph{approximate}: in $O(1)$ time for each node. The main contribution of this paper is to devise an \emph{exact} and fast incremental algorithm of RWR for edge updates. Our solution, \IRWR\!, can incrementally compute any node proximity in $O(1)$ time for each edge update without loss of exactness. The empirical evaluations show the high efficiency and exactness of \IRWR for computing proximities on dynamic networks against its batch counterparts.},

In TREC-based simulations, these procedures retain from 66% to 92% of individually significant results (i.e., those obtained without taking other comparisons into account). Similar retention rates are observed in the MSLR simulations. For the largest evaluated query set size (i.e., 6400), procedures that adjust for multiplicity find at most 5% fewer true differences compared to unadjusted tests.

 abstract = {Prior research in resource selection for federated search mainly focused on selecting a small number of information sources that are most relevant to a user query. However, result novelty and diversification are largely unexplored, which does not reflect the various kinds of information needs of users in real world applications. This paper proposes two general approaches to model both result relevance and diversification in selecting sources, in order to provide more comprehensive coverage of multiple aspects of a user query. The first approach focuses on diversifying the document ranking on a centralized sample database before selecting information sources under the framework of Relevant Document Distribution Estimation (ReDDE). The second approach first evaluates the relevance of information sources with respect to each aspect of the query, and then ranks the sources based on the novelty and relevance that they offer. Both approaches can be applied with a wide range of existing resource selection algorithms such as ReDDE, CRCS, CORI and Big Document. Moreover, this paper proposes a learning based approach to combine multiple resource selection algorithms for result diversification, which can further improve the performance. We propose a set of new metrics for resource selection in federated search to evaluate the diversification performance of different approaches. To our best knowledge, this is the first piece of work that addresses the problem of search result diversification in federated search. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches has been demonstrated by an extensive set of experiments on the federated search testbed of the Clueweb dataset.},

Nonetheless, compared with the traditional keyword-based information retrieval, extracting the hidden information related to the commodities in photos is a much more complicated and challenging task, involving techniques such as pattern recognition, knowledge base construction, semantic comprehension, and statistic deduction.

The HACASC approach utilizes a mixture of kernel ridge regressions to intelligently determine the threshold in clustering.

 abstract = {Recommender system has become an effective tool for information filtering, which usually provides the most useful items to users by a top-k ranking list. Traditional recommendation techniques such as Nearest Neighbors (NN) and Matrix Factorization (MF) have been widely used in real recommender systems. However, neither approaches can well accomplish recommendation task since that: (1) most NN methods leverage the neighbor's behaviors for prediction, which may suffer the severe data sparsity problem; (2) MF methods are less sensitive to sparsity, but neighbors' influences on latent factors are not fully explored, since the latent factors are often used independently. To overcome the above problems, we propose a new framework for recommender systems, called collaborative factorization. It expresses the user as the combination of his own factors and those of the neighbors', called collaborative latent factors, and a ranking loss is then utilized for optimization. The advantage of our approach is that it can both enjoy the merits of NN and MF methods. In this paper, we take the logistic loss in RankNet and the likelihood loss in ListMLE as examples, and the corresponding collaborative factorization methods are called CoF-Net and CoF-MLE. Our experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that they are more effective than several state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

 abstract = {The effectiveness of various behavioural signals for implicit relevance feedback models has been exhaustively studied. Despite the advantages of such techniques for a real time information retrieval system, most of the behavioural signals are noisy and therefore not reliable enough to be employed. Among many, a combination of dwell time and task information has been shown to be effective for relevance judgement prediction. However, the task information might not be available to the system at all times. Thus, there is a need for other sources of information which can be used as a substitute for task information. Recently, affective and physiological signals have shown promise as a potential source of information for relevance judgement prediction. However, their accuracy is not high enough to be applicable on their own. This paper investigates whether affective and physiological signals can be used as a complementary source of information for behavioural signals (i.e. dwell time) to create a reliable signal for relevance judgement prediction. Using a video retrieval system as a use case, we study and compare the effectiveness of the affective and physiological signals on their own, as well as in combination with behavioural signals for the relevance judgment prediction task across four different search intentions: seeking information, re-finding a particular information object, and two different entertainment intentions (i.e. entertainment by adjusting arousal level, and entertainment by adjusting mood). Our experimental results show that the effectiveness of studied signals varies across different search intentions, and when affective and physiological signals are combined with dwell time, a significant improvement can be achieved. Overall, these findings will help to implement better search engines in the future.},

 abstract = {The reliability of a test collection is proportional to the number of queries it contains. But building a collection with many queries is expensive, so researchers have to find a balance between reliability and cost. Previous work on the measurement of test collection reliability relied on data-based approaches that contemplated random what if scenarios, and provided indicators such as swap rates and Kendall tau correlations. Generalizability Theory was proposed as an alternative founded on analysis of variance that provides reliability indicators based on statistical theory. However, these reliability indicators are hard to interpret in practice, because they do not correspond to well known indicators like Kendall tau correlation. We empirically established these relationships based on data from over 40 TREC collections, thus filling the gap in the practical interpretation of Generalizability Theory. We also review the computation of these indicators, and show that they are extremely dependent on the sample of systems and queries used, so much that the required number of queries to achieve a certain level of reliability can vary in orders of magnitude. We discuss the computation of confidence intervals for these statistics, providing a much more reliable tool to measure test collection reliability. Reflecting upon all these results, we review a wealth of TREC test collections, arguing that they are possibly not as reliable as generally accepted and that the common choice of 50 queries is insufficient even for stable rankings.},

These algorithms are based on the document-at-a-time approach and modify the best baseline we found in the literature, Blockmax WAND (BMW), to take advantage of a two-tiered index, in which the first tier is a small index containing only the higher impact entries of each inverted list. This small index is used to pre-process the query before accessing a larger index in the second tier, resulting in considerable speeding up the whole process. The first algorithm we propose, named BMW-CS, achieves higher performance, but may result in small changes in the top results provided in the final ranking. The second algorithm, named BMW-t, preserves the top results and, while slower than BMW-CS, it is faster than BMW. In our experiments, BMW-CS was more than 40 times faster than BMW when computing top 10 results, and, while it does not guarantee preserving the top results, it preserved all ranking results evaluated at this level.},

 abstract = {Term weighting schemes are central to the study of information retrieval systems. This article proposes a novel TF-IDF term weighting scheme that employs two different within document term frequency normalizations to capture two different aspects of term saliency. One component of the term frequency is effective for short queries, while the other performs better on long queries. The final weight is then measured by taking a weighted combination of these components, which is determined on the basis of the length of the corresponding query. Experiments conducted on a large number of TREC news and web collections demonstrate that the proposed scheme almost always outperforms five state of the art retrieval models with remarkable significance and consistency. The experimental results also show that the proposed model achieves significantly better precision than the existing models.},

Current state-of-the-art approaches are highly supervised and require training examples for each entity monitored. We propose an approach which does not require new training data when processing a new entity. To capture intrinsic characteristics of highly relevant documents our approach relies on three types of features: document centric features, entity profile related features and time features.

 abstract = {Many documents with mathematical content are published on the Web, but conventional search engines that rely on keyword search only cannot fully exploit their mathematical information. In particular, keyword search is insufficient when expressions in a document are not annotated with natural keywords or the user cannot describe her query with keywords. Retrieving documents by querying their mathematical content directly is very appealing in various domains such as education, digital libraries, engineering, patent documents, medical sciences, etc. Capturing the relevance of mathematical expressions also greatly enhances document classification in such domains. Unlike text retrieval, where keywords carry enough semantics to distinguish text documents and rank them, math symbols do not contain much semantic information on their own. In fact, mathematical expressions typically consist of few alphabetical symbols organized in rather complex structures. Hence, the structure of an expression, which describes the way such symbols are combined, should also be considered. Unfortunately, there is no standard testbed with which to evaluate the effectiveness of a mathematics retrieval algorithm. In this paper we study the fundamental and challenging problems in mathematics retrieval, that is how to capture the relevance of mathematical expressions, how to query them, and how to evaluate the results. We describe various search paradigms and propose retrieval systems accordingly. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each approach, and further compare them through an extensive empirical study.},

As web search on smart phones and tablets becomes increasingly popular, previously validated desktop interaction models have to be adapted for the available touch interactions such as pinching and swiping, and for the different device form factors. In this paper, we present, to our knowledge, the first in-depth study of modeling interactions on touch-enabled device for improving Web search ranking. In particular, we evaluate a variety of touch interactions on a smart phone as implicit relevance feedback, and compare them with the corresponding fine-grained interactions on a desktop computer with mouse and keyboard as the primary input devices. Our experiments are based on a dataset collected from two user studies with 56 users in total, using a specially instrumented version of a popular mobile browser to capture the interaction data. We report a detailed analysis of the similarities and differences of fine-grained search interactions between the desktop and the smart phone modalities, and identify novel patterns of touch interactions indicative of result relevance. Finally, we demonstrate significant improvements to search ranking quality by mining touch interaction data.},

 abstract = {Web search queries are often ambiguous or multi-faceted, which makes a simple ranked list of results inadequate. To assist information finding for such faceted queries, we explore a technique that explicitly represents interesting facets of a query using groups of semantically related terms extracted from search results. As an example, for the query ``baggage allowance'', these groups might be different airlines, different flight types (domestic, international), or different travel classes (first, business, economy). We name these groups query facets and the terms in these groups facet terms. We develop a supervised approach based on a graphical model to recognize query facets from the noisy candidates found. The graphical model learns how likely a candidate term is to be a facet term as well as how likely two terms are to be grouped together in a query facet, and captures the dependencies between the two factors. We propose two algorithms for approximate inference on the graphical model since exact inference is intractable. Our evaluation combines recall and precision of the facet terms with the grouping quality. Experimental results on a sample of web queries show that the supervised method significantly outperforms existing approaches, which are mostly unsupervised, suggesting that query facet extraction can be effectively learned.},

The resultant retrieval effectiveness is substantially better than that of the initial list for several lists that are produced by effective retrieval methods. Furthermore, our cluster ranking approach significantly outperforms state-of- the-art cluster ranking methods.

 abstract = {Twitter has attracted hundred millions of users to share and disseminate most up-to-date information. However, the noisy and short nature of tweets makes many applications in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) challenging. Recently, segment-based tweet representation has demonstrated effectiveness in named entity recognition (NER) and event detection from tweet streams. To split tweets into meaningful phrases or segments, the previous work is purely based on external knowledge bases, which ignores the rich local context information embedded in the tweets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for tweet segmentation in a batch mode, called HybridSeg. HybridSeg incorporates local context knowledge with global knowledge bases for better tweet segmentation. HybridSeg consists of two steps: learning from off-the-shelf weak NERs and learning from pseudo feedback. In the first step, the existing NER tools are applied to a batch of tweets. The named entities recognized by these NERs are then employed to guide the tweet segmentation process. In the second step, HybridSeg adjusts the tweet segmentation results iteratively by exploiting all segments in the batch of tweets in a collective manner. Experiments on two tweet datasets show that HybridSeg significantly improves tweet segmentation quality compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm. We also conduct a case study by using tweet segments for the task of named entity recognition from tweets. The experimental results demonstrate that HybridSeg significantly benefits the downstream applications.},

This paper presents a novel and general collaborative filtering framework based on (Approximate) Bordered Block Diagonal Form structure of user-item rating matrices. We show formally that matrices in (A)BBDF structures correspond to community detection on the corresponding bipartite graphs, and they reveal relationships among users and items intuitionally in recommendation tasks. By this framework, general and special interests of a user are distinguished, which helps to improve prediction accuracy in collaborative filtering tasks. Experimental results on four real-world datasets, including the Yahoo! Music dataset, which is currently the largest, show that the proposed framework helps many traditional collaborative filtering algorithms, such as User-based, Item-based, SVD and NMF approaches, to make more accurate rating predictions. Moreover, by leveraging smaller and denser submatrices to make predictions, this framework contributes to the scalability of recommender systems.},

Nevertheless, existing work on timeline generation often ignores an important factor, the attention attracted to topics of interest (hereafter termed "social attention"). Without taking into consideration social attention, the generated timelines may not reflect users' collective interests. In this paper, we study how to incorporate social attention in the generation of timeline summaries. In particular, for a given topic, we capture social attention by learning users' collective interests in the form of word distributions from Twitter, which are subsequently incorporated into a unified framework for timeline summary generation. We construct four evaluation sets over six diverse topics. We demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to generate both informative and interesting timelines.

 abstract = {Aggregated search interfaces provide users with an overview of results from various sources. Two general types of display exist: tabbed, with access to each source in a separate tab, and blended, which combines multiple sources into a single result page. Multi-session search tasks, e.g., a research project, consist of multiple stages, each with its own sub-tasks. Several factors involved in multi-session search tasks have been found to influence user search behavior. We investigate whether user preference for source presentation changes during a multi-session search task. The dynamic nature of multi-session search tasks makes the design of a controlled experiment a non-trivial challenge. We adopt a methodology based on triangulation and conduct two types of observational study: a longitudinal study and a laboratory study. In the longitudinal study we follow the use of tabbed and blended displays by 25 students during a project. We find that while a tabbed display is used more than a blended display, subjects repeatedly switch between displays during the project. Use of the tabbed display is motivated by a need to zoom in on a specific source, while the blended display is used to explore available material across sources whenever the information need changes. In a laboratory study 44 students completed a multi-session search task composed of three sub-tasks, the first with a tabbed display, the second and third with blended displays. The tasks were manipulated by either providing three task about the same topic or about three different topics. We find that a stable information need over multiple sub-tasks negatively influences perceived usability of the blended displays, while we do not find an influence when the information need changes.},

 abstract = {Welcome to SIGIR, the 37th annual international ACM conference on research and development in Information Retrieval, the premier international conference in the area. We acknowledge all those who submitted papers to the conference and gave the program committee an opportunity to evaluate their work for potential inclusion in the program. Huge thanks are owed to the 57 Area Chairs and 244 general program committee members, who represent 31 countries and almost 200 institutions, for their dedicated work in evaluating the submissions. The conference received 387 full paper submissions (6% increase over last year) of which 82 (21%) were accepted. This constitutes a slight increase on the acceptance rate over last year. The top five countries in terms of accepted papers (taking all author affiliations of each paper equally into account) were the U.S.A. (36%), China (18%), Singapore (9%), Israel (4%), and The Netherlands (3%). The coverage of accepted papers across topics is as follows: Document Representation and Content Analysis (13%), Queries and Query Analysis (16%), Users and Interactive IR (17%), Retrieval Models and Ranking (9%), Search Engine Architectures and Scalability (8%), Filtering and Recommending (8%), Evaluation (5%), Web IR and Social Media Search (13%), IR and Structured Data (1%), Multimedia IR (5%), Other Applications (5%). As has been customary for many years, SIGIR 2014 employed a two-tier double-blind review process. At least three reviewers reviewed each paper, and then the Primary Area Chair of the paper led a discussion, based on which (s)he wrote a meta-review. The Secondary Area Chair assigned to each paper double-checked the reviews and discussion, and in some cases, provided an additional review. The PC chairs ranked the submitted papers by the meta-review score and then by the average score of the three reviewer scores, carefully examined the reviews and associated discussion. The PC chairs first identified "clear accepts" and "clear rejects". Then the undecided papers were carefully discussed in a face-to-face PC meeting held in Amsterdam, which involved all available Area Chairs. We would like to heartily thank Jaap Kamps for his assistance in organizing the Amsterdam meeting (even mindfully keeping us on track at times!), providing necessary support materials including a dinner, all of which was greatly appreciated by those who attended the meeting. The short papers track received 263 submissions (3% increase over last year) and accepted 104 of them (40% acceptance compared to 34% last year). For the second year, the short papers are four pages long. Deep thanks to Vanessa Murdock, Gabriella Pasi and Andrew Turpin, the short paper track chairs, for their very hard and sustained work in arranging and managing a thorough review process for so many papers. The tutorial track received 17 submissions, 16 of which underwent review. Seven proposals were accepted. Thanks to Falk Scholer for managing the review process which has ensured a diverse tutorial program of excellent quality. We received 11 workshop proposals, each of which was peer-reviewed by three members of the Workshops PC, and after discussion of all submissions in the Workshops PC, the final decisions were made in consultation with the PC Chairs of the technical program. A total of 7 workshops were accepted (a 64% acceptance rate). We thank Jaap Kamps and Gabriella Kazai for their efforts in producing a great set of workshops. The Demos track received 34 submissions of which 16 were accepted. Many thanks to Paul Thomas for chairing this track and providing us with an array of interesting demos to look at. The Doctoral Consortium received 11 submissions this year of which 8 were ultimately acceptances. We are grateful to Shane Culpepper and Grace Hui Yang for chairing the consortium. This year's industry event is the SIGIR Symposium on IR in Practice (SIRIP 2014) co-chaired by Isabelle Moulinier and David Hawking. Their efforts in organizing SIRIP are gratefully acknowledged. In addition to abstracts of invited talks by industry researchers, and practitioners and consumers of IR, the SIRIP 2014 proceedings include refereed research papers with a strong industry focus (four pages). The proceedings are published separately in electronic-only format. Finally, special thanks to Mounia Lalmas for chairing the panel to select the Best Paper and Best Student Paper. This year, SIGIR has the enormous honor of hosting an ACM-W Athena award lecture to be delivered by Susan Dumais. This prestigious award celebrates women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to Computer Science.},

 abstract = {A large amount of research has focused on faster methods for finding top-k results in large document collections, one of the main scalability challenges for web search engines. In this paper, we propose a method for accelerating such top-k queries that builds on and generalizes methods recently proposed by several groups of researchers based on Block-Max Indexes. In particular, we describe a system that uses a new filtering mechanism, based on a combination of block maxima and bitmaps, that radically reduces the number of documents that have to be further evaluated. Our filtering mechanism exploits the SIMD processing capabilities of current microprocessors, and it is optimized through caching policies that select and store suitable filter structures based on properties of the query load. Our experimental evaluation shows that the mechanism results in very significant speed-ups for disjunctive top-k queries under several state-of-the-art algorithms, including a speed-up of more than a factor of 2 over the fastest previously known methods.},

Given a fixed set of features and a learning-to-rank model, we explore effectiveness/efficiency tradeoffs with three candidate generation approaches: postings intersection with SvS, conjunctive query evaluation with WAND, and disjunctive query evaluation with WAND. We find no significant differences in end-to-end effectiveness as measured by NDCG between conjunctive and disjunctive WAND, but conjunctive query evaluation is substantially faster. Postings intersection with SvS, while fast, yields substantially lower end-to-end effectiveness, suggesting that document and term frequencies remain important in the initial ranking stage. These findings show that conjunctive WAND is the best overall candidate generation strategy of those we examined.},

 abstract = {Search systems use context to effectively satisfy a user's information need as expressed by a query. Tasks are important factors in determining user context during search and many studies have been conducted that identify tasks and task stages through users' interaction behavior with search systems. The type of interaction available to users, however, depends on the type of search interface features available. Queries are the most pervasive input from users to express their information need regardless of the input method, e.g., typing keywords or clicking facets. Instead of characterizing interaction behavior in terms of interface specific components, we propose to characterize users' search behavior in terms of two types of query modification: (i) direct modification, which refers to reformulations of queries; and (ii) indirect modification, which refers to user operations on additional input components provided by various search interfaces. We investigate the utility of characterizing task stages through direct and indirect query reformulations in a case study and find that it is possible to effectively differentiate subsequent stages of the search task. We found that describing user interaction behavior in such a generic form allowed us to relate user actions to search task stages independent from the specific search interface deployed. The next step will then be to validate this idea in a setting with a wider palette of search tasks and tools.},

 abstract = {Mining the latent topics from web search data and capturing their spatiotemporal patterns have many applications in information retrieval. As web search is heavily influenced by the spatial and temporal factors, the latent topics usually demonstrate a variety of spatiotemporal patterns. In the face of the diversity of these patterns, existing models are increasingly ineffective, since they capture only one dimension of the spatiotemporal patterns (either the spatial or temporal dimension) or simply assume that there exists only one kind of spatiotemporal patterns. Such oversimplification risks distorting the latent data structure and hindering the downstream usage of the discovered topics. In this paper, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Search Topic Model (SSTM) to discover the latent topics from web search data with capturing their diverse spatiotemporal patterns simultaneously. The SSTM can flexibly support diverse spatiotemporal patterns and seamlessly integrate the unique features in web search such as query words, URLs, timestamps and search sessions. The SSTM is demonstrated as an effective exploratory tool for large-scale web search data and it performs superiorly in quantitative comparisons to several state-of-the-art topic models.},

The method is shown to be generic in that it covers most of the popular QE models as special cases and flexible in that it provides a principled mathematical framework in which a wide variety of information useful for QE can be incorporated in a unified way. Evaluation is performed on the Web document ranking task using a real-world data set.

While topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have a long history of successful application to news articles and academic abstracts, they are often less coherent when applied to microblog content like Twitter. In this paper, we investigate methods to improve topics learned from Twitter content without modifying the basic machinery of LDA; we achieve this through various pooling schemes that aggregate tweets in a data preprocessing step for LDA. We empirically establish that a novel method of tweet pooling by hashtags leads to a vast improvement in a variety of measures for topic coherence across three diverse Twitter datasets in comparison to an unmodified LDA baseline and a variety of pooling schemes. An additional contribution of automatic hashtag labeling further improves on the hashtag pooling results for a subset of metrics. Overall, these two novel schemes lead to significantly improved LDA topic models on Twitter content.},

 abstract = {Query auto-completion (QAC) is one of the most prominent features of modern search engines. The list of query candidates is generated according to the prefix entered by the user in the search box and is updated on each new key stroke. Query prefixes tend to be short and ambiguous, and existing models mostly rely on the past popularity of matching candidates for ranking. However, the popularity of certain queries may vary drastically across different demographics and users. For instance, while instagram and imdb have comparable popularities overall and are both legitimate candidates to show for prefix i, the former is noticeably more popular among young female users, and the latter is more likely to be issued by men. In this paper, we present a supervised framework for personalizing auto-completion ranking. We introduce a novel labelling strategy for generating offline training labels that can be used for learning personalized rankers. We compare the effectiveness of several user-specific and demographic-based features and show that among them, the user's long-term search history and location are the most effective for personalizing auto-completion rankers. We perform our experiments on the publicly available AOL query logs, and also on the larger-scale logs of Bing. The results suggest that supervised rankers enhanced by personalization features can significantly outperform the existing popularity-based base-lines, in terms of mean reciprocal rank (MRR) by up to 9%.},

This paper describes a novel way of building a test collection for web search by exploiting the link information from this type of social media data. We propose to build the test collection by regarding CQA questions as queries and the associated linked web pages as relevant documents. To evaluate this approach, we collect approximately ten thousand CQA queries, whose answers contained links to ClueWeb09 documents after spam filtering. Experimental results using this collection show that the relative effectiveness between different retrieval models on the ClueWeb-CQA query set is consistent with that on the TREC Web Track query sets, confirming the reliability of our test collection. Further analysis shows that the large number of queries generated through this approach compensates for the sparse relevance judgments in determining significant differences.},

@inproceedings{Wang:2013:SHU:2484028.2484037,
 abstract = {It is an important research problem to design efficient and effective solutions for large scale similarity search. One popular strategy is to represent data examples as compact binary codes through semantic hashing, which has produced promising results with fast search speed and low storage cost. Many existing semantic hashing methods generate binary codes for documents by modeling document relationships based on similarity in a keyword feature space. Two major limitations in existing methods are: (1) Tag information is often associated with documents in many real world applications, but has not been fully exploited yet; (2) The similarity in keyword feature space does not fully reflect semantic relationships that go beyond keyword matching. This paper proposes a novel hashing approach, Semantic Hashing using Tags and Topic Modeling (SHTTM), to incorporate both the tag information and the similarity information from probabilistic topic modeling. In particular, a unified framework is designed for ensuring hashing codes to be consistent with tag information by a formal latent factor model and preserving the document topic/semantic similarity that goes beyond keyword matching. An iterative coordinate descent procedure is proposed for learning the optimal hashing codes. An extensive set of empirical studies on four different datasets has been conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed SHTTM approach against several other state-of-the-art semantic hashing techniques. Furthermore, experimental results indicate that the modeling of tag information and utilizing topic modeling are beneficial for improving the effectiveness of hashing separately, while the combination of these two techniques in the unified framework obtains even better results.},

 abstract = {The interest of users in handheld devices is strongly related to their location. Therefore, the user location is important, as a user context, for news article recommendation in a mobile environment. This paper proposes a novel news article recommendation that reflects the geographical context of the user. For this purpose, we propose the Explicit Localized Semantic Analysis (ELSA), an ESA-based topical representation of documents. Every location has its own geographical topics, which can be captured from the geo-tagged documents related to the location. Thus, not only news articles but locations are also represented as topic vectors. The main advantage of ELSA is that it stresses only the topics that are relevant to a given location, whereas all topics are equally important in ESA. As a result, geographical topics have different importance according to the user location in ELSA, even if they come from the same article. Another advantage of ELSA is that it allows a simple comparison of the user location and news articles, because it projects both locations and articles onto an identical space composed of Wikipedia topics. In the evaluation of ELSA with the New York Times corpus, it outperformed two simple baselines of Bag-Of-Words and LDA as well as two ESA-based methods. Rt10 of ELSA was improved up to 46.25% over other methods, and its NDCG@k was always higher than those of the others regardless of k.},

 abstract = {At present, most major app marketplaces perform ranking and recommendation based on search relevance features or marketplace ``popularity'' statistics. For instance, they check similarity between app descriptions and user search queries, or rank-order the apps according to statistics such as number of downloads, user ratings etc. Rankings derived from such signals, important as they are, are insufficient to capture the dynamics of the apps ecosystem. Consider for example the questions: In a particular user context, is app A more likely to be launched than app B? Or does app C provide complementary functionality to app D-- Answering these questions requires identifying and analyzing the dependencies between apps in the apps ecosystem. Ranking mechanisms that reflect such interdependences are thus necessary. In this paper we introduce the notion of interoperability ranking for mobile applications. Intuitively, apps with high rank are such apps which are inferred to be somehow important to other apps in the ecosystem. We demonstrate how interoperability ranking can help answer the above questions and also provide the basis for solving several problems which are rapidly attracting the attention of both researchers and the industry, such as building personalized real-time app recommender systems or intelligent mobile agents. We describe a set of methods for computing interoperability ranks and analyze their performance on real data from the Windows Phone app marketplace.},

 abstract = {In this paper we present the IRSA framework that enables the automatic creation of search term suggestion or recommendation systems (TS). Such TS are used to operationalize interactive query expansion and help users in refining their information need in the query formulation phase. Our recent research has shown TS to be more effective when specific to a certain domain. The presented technical framework allows owners of Digital Libraries to create their own specific TS constructed via OAI-harvested metadata with very little effort.},

 abstract = {While existing test collections and evaluation conference efforts may sufficiently support one's research, one can easily find oneself wanting to solve problems no one else is solving yet. But how can research in IR be done (or be published!) without solid data and experiments? Not everyone can talk TREC, CLEF, INEX, or NTCIR into running a track to build a collection. This tutorial aims to teach how to build a test collection using resources at hand, how to measure the quality of that collection, how to understand its limitations, and how to communicate them. The intended audience is advanced students who find themselves in need of a test collection, or actually in the process of building a test collection, to support their own research. The goal of this tutorial is to lay out issues, procedures, pitfalls, and practical advice.},

And who started it? Because of the speed at which discussions sometimes take place this can be difficult to track down. We describe ThemeStreams: a demonstrator that maps political discussions to themes and influencers and illustrate how this mapping is used in an interactive visualization that shows us which themes are being discussed, and that helps us answer the question "Who put this issue on the map?" in streams of political data.},

 abstract = {The query-performance prediction (QPP) task is estimating retrieval effectiveness with no relevance judgments. We present a novel probabilistic framework for QPP that gives rise to an important aspect that was not addressed in previous work; namely, the extent to which the query effectively represents the information need for retrieval. Accordingly, we devise a few query-representativeness measures that utilize relevance language models. Experiments show that integrating the most effective measures with state-of-the-art predictors in our framework often yields prediction quality that significantly transcends that of using the predictors alone.},
