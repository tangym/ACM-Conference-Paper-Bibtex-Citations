 abstract = {Users often configure complex objects with many possible internal choices. Recommendation engines that automatically configure such objects given user preferences and constraints, may provide much value in such cases. These applications generate appropriate recommendations based on user preferences. It is likely, though, that the user will not be able to fully express her preferences and constraints, requiring a phase of manual tuning of the recommended configuration. We suggest that following this manual revision, additional constraints and preferences can be automatically collected, and the recommended configuration can be automatically improved. Specifically, we suggest a recommender component that takes as input an initial manual configuration of a complex object, deduces certain user preferences and constraints from this configuration, and constructs an alternative configuration. We show an appealing application for our method in complex trip planning, and demonstrate its usability in a user study.},

Simulating random walks on a graph which fits in memory is trivial, but massive graphs pose a problem: the latency of following walks across network in a cluster or loading nodes from disk on-demand renders basic random walk simulation unbearably inefficient. In this work we propose DrunkardMob, a new algorithm for simulating hundreds of millions, or even billions, of random walks on massive graphs, on just a single PC or laptop. Instead of simulating one walk a time it processes millions of them in parallel, in a batch. Based on DrunkardMob and GraphChi we further propose a framework for easily expressing scalable algorithms based on graph walks.},

In our approach, we model both user preferences and items under recommendation as multivariate Gaussian distributions; and make use of Normal-Inverse Wishart priors to model the recommendation agent beliefs about user types. We employ a lightweight agent-user interaction process, during which the user is presented with and asked to rate a small number of items. We then interpret these ratings in an innovative way, using them to guide a Bayesian updating process that helps us both capture a user's current mood, and maintain her overall user type. We produced several variants of our approach, and applied them in the movie recommendations domain, evaluating them on data from the MovieLens dataset. Our algorithms are shown to be competitive against a state-of-the-art method, which nevertheless requires a minimum set of ratings from various users to provide recommendations---unlike our entirely personalized approach.},

 abstract = {Finding books that children/teenagers are interested in these days is a non-trivial task due to the diversity of topics covered in huge volumes of books with varied readability levels. Even though K-12 readers can turn to book recommenders to look for books, the recommended books may not satisfy their personal needs, since they could be beyond/below their readability levels or fail to match their topics of interest. To address these problems, we introduce BReK12, a book recommender that makes personalized suggestions tailored to each K-12 user U based on books available on a social book-marking site that (i) are similar in content to the ones that are known to be of interest to U, (ii) have been bookmarked by users with reading patterns similar to U's, and (iii) can be comprehended by U. BReK12 is an asset to its users, since it suggests books that are appealing to its users and at grade levels that they can cope with, which can increase their reading selection choices and motivate them to read. We have also developed ReLAT, the readability analysis tool employed by BReK12 to determine the grade level of books. ReLAT is novel, compared with existing readability formulas, since it can predict the grade level of a book even if an excerpt of the book is not available. We have conducted empirical studies which have verified the accuracy of ReLAT in predicting the grade level of a book and the effectiveness of BReK12 over existing baseline recommendation systems.},

 abstract = {Daily deals sites (DDSs), such as Groupon and LivingSocial, attract millions of customers in the hunt for products and services at significantly reduced prices. A typical approach to increase revenue is to send email messages featuring the deals of the day. Such daily messages, however, are usually not centered on the customers, instead, all registered users typically receive similar messages with almost the same deals. Traditional recommendation algorithms are innocuous in DDSs because: (i) most of the users are sporadic bargain hunters, and thus past preference data is extremely sparse, (ii) deals have a short living period, and thus data is extremely volatile, and (iii) user taste and interest may undergo temporal drifts. In order to address such particularly challenging scenario, we propose new algorithms for daily deals recommendation based on the explore-then-exploit strategy.Users are split into exploration and exploitation sets -- in the exploration set the users receive non-personalized messages and a co-purchase network is updated with user feedback for purchases of the day, while in the exploitation set the updated network is used for recommending personalized messages for the remaining users.A thorough evaluation of our algorithms using real data obtained from a large daily deals website in Brazil in contrast to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms show gains in precision ranging from 18% to 34%.},

 abstract = {In a social network, users can sort members of their social graph into friend lists to both understand the social structures within the graph and control the flow of incoming and outgoing information. To reduce the user-effort required to create these lists, previous work has developed techniques for generating friend-lists in a static social graph. This paper considers the user effort required to create friend lists in an evolving graph. We have developed several new initial quantitative metrics to capture this effort, and identified an initial technique for modeling graph growth. We have used these metrics and model to compare two techniques for evolving friend lists when the social graph grows: manual evolution - the user evolves friend lists using no external tools -- and full recommendation -- an existing state of the art tool recommends a whole new set of friend lists. In these comparisons, we used the friend lists of 12 individuals, and simulated the growth of their social graphs and friend lists using our graph-growth model. Intuitively, when the graph evolves by a small (large) amount, the manual (automatic) approach should perform better. Our experiments show that full recommendation performs better than manual when the social graph changes by more than 1%, and yields an almost complete reduction in effort in the best cases.},

 abstract = {In the field of recommendation system research, a key challenge is how to effectively recommend items for new users, a problem generally known as cold-start recommendation. In order to alleviate cold-start problem, recently systems try to get the users' interests by progressively querying users' preference on predefined items. Constructing the query process via machine learning based techniques becomes an important direction to solve cold-start problem. In this paper, we propose a novel interview process learning algorithm. Different from previous approaches which focus on rate prediction, our model is able to handle wide ranges of loss functions and can be used in collaborative ranking task. Experimental results on three real world recommendation dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several baseline methods.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 7th ACM Recommender Systems Conference (ACM RecSys 2013), held in Hong Kong on October 12-16. As RecSys enters the second half of its first decade, it has clearly established itself as the premier international venue for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. The growing prestige of the conference is reflected by the significant increase in the number of papers that were submitted to the technical program. The overall number of paper submissions went up 20% as compared to last year, with a total of 222 submissions. We received 136 full paper submissions, from which 32 were accepted (23.5%) for oral presentation and 18 were accepted as short papers and poster presentations. We received 80 short paper submissions, from which 24 were accepted (28.75%). Seven of these short papers were selected for short oral presentation and the remaining for poster presentation. For the first time this year, in addition to full and short papers, we also had a new category of submissions consisting of full-length industry papers. We received six papers in this category, out of which two papers were accepted and were presented during the industrial research session. To accommodate the large number of high-quality papers that we received and accepted, the number of research sessions has been increased to eight from the previous year's five sessions. Besides the technical program, the conference's overall program also includes tutorials, workshops, a doctoral symposium, and demonstrations. The tutorial program includes four exciting tutorials covering state-of-the-art methods for building recommender systems and emerging application areas. The workshop program includes eight different one-day workshops that take place the two days prior to the main conference. The doctoral symposium showcases the work of six PhD students, whose work has been selected after a rigorous review process. Finally, the demonstration program contains five different demonstrations covering various aspects of recommender systems. The conference program also includes three keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Oren Etzioni (University of Washington) and two from an industrial perspective by Dou Shen (Baidu) and Mu Yan (Beihe). Finally, continuing with the tradition of the conference, there is a strong integration of the research with its commercial applications. This is reflected through the strong participation of industry at the workshops, demonstrations, and technical program, as well as a special industrial session containing presentations of the accepted industry papers, invited talks, and panel discussions.},

 abstract = {Power users, in a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender System (RS) context, are those who can exert considerable influence over the recommendation outcomes presented to other users. RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase decisions. Thus, RS research in this area has focused on power user selection and utilization to address challenges such as rating sparsity for new items or users. But, as ever, there remains the potential for corruption by power users who provide biased ratings. And because of the influence that power users wield, biased ratings they provide can have significant impacts on RS accuracy and robustness. In order to better understand this problem and develop solution strategies, our research is investigating the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when power users provide biased ratings. The open areas of research we have explored are analyzing and evaluating power user selection techniques, statistically characterizing power users in order to create attack profiles, mounting power user attacks on new items, and using accuracy and robustness metrics to evaluate power user attacks. In the future, we plan to extend our initial research in power user selection, characterization, and evaluation, as well as generate attack profiles based on power user characteristics, mount power user attacks on user-based, item-based, and SVD-based CF systems, evaluate power user attacks, and generalize our work across different domains.},

 abstract = {Personalization techniques have been widely adopted in many recommender systems. However, experiments on real-world datasets show that for some users in certain contexts, personalized recommendations do not necessarily perform better than recommendations that rely purely on popularity. Broadly, this can be interpreted by the fact that the parameters of a personalization model are usually estimated from sparse data; the resulting personalized prediction, despite of its low bias, is often volatile. In this paper, we study the problem further by investigating into the ranking of recommendation lists. From a risk management and portfolio retrieval perspective, there is no difference between the popularity-based and the personalized ranking as both of the recommendation outputs can be represented as the trade-off between expected relevance (reward) and associated uncertainty (risk). Through our analysis, we discover common scenarios and provide a technique to predict whether personalization will fail. Besides the theoretical understanding, our experimental results show that the resulting switch algorithm, which decides whether or not to personalize, outperforms the mainstream recommendation algorithms.},

 abstract = {Making recommendations by learning to rank is becoming an increasingly studied area. Approaches that use stochastic gradient descent scale well to large collaborative filtering datasets, and it has been shown how to approximately optimize the mean rank, or more recently the top of the ranked list. In this work we present a family of loss functions, the k-order statistic loss, that includes these previous approaches as special cases, and also derives new ones that we show to be useful. In particular, we present (i) a new variant that more accurately optimizes precision at k, and (ii) a novel procedure of optimizing the mean maximum rank, which we hypothesize is useful to more accurately cover all of the user's tastes. The general approach works by sampling N positive items, ordering them by the score assigned by the model, and then weighting the example as a function of this ordered set. Our approach is studied in two real-world systems, Google Music and YouTube video recommendations, where we obtain improvements for computable metrics, and in the YouTube case, increased user click through and watch duration when deployed live on www.youtube.com.},

The fees that RS providers charge their clients must cover the computation costs for constructing and updating the recommendation model. By using anytime algorithms, a RS provider can control the computation costs and still offer a system capable of delivering reasonable recommendations. Thus, a RS provider should be able to stop the construction of a recommendation model once the cost for compu-ting it reaches the amount the customer has agreed to pay. In this research we suggest anytime algorithms as a possible solu-tion to a problem that RS providers face. We demonstrate how certain existing recommendation algorithms can be adjusted to the anytime framework. We focus on the case of item-item algorithms, showing how the anytime behavior can be improved using different ordering methods of computations. We conduct a comparative study demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods for top-N item-item recommenders.},

 abstract = {Improving recommendation accuracy is the mostly focused target of recommendation systems, while it has been increasingly recognized that accuracy is not enough as the only quality criterion. More concepts have been proposed recently to augment the evaluation dimensions, such as similarity, diversity, long-tail, etc. Simultaneously considering multiple criteria leads to a multi-task recommendation. In this paper, a graph-based recommendation approach is proposed to effectively and flexibly trade-off among them. Our approach is considered based a 1st order Markovian graph with transition probabilities between user-item pairs. A "cost flow" concept is proposed over the graph, so that items with lower costs are stronger recommended to a user. The cost flows are formulated in a recursive dynamic form, whose stability is proved to be guaranteed by appropriately lower-bounding the transition costs. Furthermore, a mixture of transition costs is designed by combining three ingredients related to long-tail, focusing degree and similarity. To evaluate the ingredients, we propose an orthogonal-sparse-orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri-factorization model and an efficient multiplicative algorithm. Empirical experiments on real-world data show promising results of our approach, which could be regarded as a general framework for other affects if transition costs are designed in various ways.},

 abstract = {The literature on recommender systems distinguishes typically between two broad categories of measuring recommendation accuracy: rating prediction, often quantified in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE), and ranking, measured in terms of metrics like precision and recall, among others. In this paper, we examine both approaches in detail, and find that the dominating difference lies instead in the training and test data considered: rating prediction is concerned with only the observed ratings, while ranking typically accounts for all items in the collection, whether the user has rated them or not. Furthermore, we show that predicting observed ratings, while popular in the literature, only solves a (small) part of the rating prediction task for any item in the collection, which is a common real-world problem. The reasons are selection bias in the data, combined with data sparsity. We show that the latter rating-prediction task involves the prediction task 'Who rated What' as a sub-problem, which can be cast as a classification or ranking problem. This suggests that solving the ranking problem is not only valuable by itself, but also for predicting the rating value of any item.},

The availability of spatial, temporal and social information in online LBSNs offers an unprecedented opportunity to study various aspects of human behavior, and enable a variety of location-based services such as location recommendation. Previous work studied spatial and social influences on location recommendation in LBSNs. Due to the strong correlations between a user's check-in time and the corresponding check-in location, recommender systems designed for location recommendation inevitably need to consider temporal effects. In this paper, we introduce a novel location recommendation framework, based on the temporal properties of user movement observed from a real-world LBSN dataset. The experimental results exhibit the significance of temporal patterns in explaining user behavior, and demonstrate their power to improve location recommendation performance.},

 abstract = {We present a matrix factorization model inspired by challenges we encountered while working on the Xbox movies recommendation system. The item catalog in a recommender system is typically equipped with meta-data features in the form of labels. However, only part of these features are informative or useful with regard to collaborative filtering. By incorporating a novel sparsity prior on feature parameters, the model automatically discerns and utilizes informative features while simultaneously pruning non-informative features. The model is designed for binary feedback, which is common in many real-world systems where numeric rating data is scarce or non-existent. However, the overall framework is applicable to any likelihood function. Model parameters are estimated with a Variational Bayes inference algorithm, which is robust to over-fitting and does not require cross-validation and fine tuning of regularization coefficients. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on a sample from the Xbox movies dataset as well as on the publicly available MovieLens dataset. In both cases, the proposed solution provides superior predictive accuracy, especially for long-tail items. We then demonstrate the feature selection capabilities and compare against the common case of simple Gaussian priors. Finally, we show that even without features, our model performs better than a baseline model trained with the popular stochastic gradient descent approach.},

R-MF learns to rank by "retargeting" the item ratings of each user, searching for a monotonic transformation of the ratings that results in a better fit while preserving the ranked order of each user's ratings. The retargeting is combined with an underlying matrix factorization regression model that couples the user-wise rankings to exploit shared low dimensional structure. We show that R-MF recovers a unique solution under mild conditions, and propose a simple and efficient optimization scheme that alternates between retargeting the ratings subject to ordering constraints, and matrix factorization regression. The retargeting step is independent for each user, and is trivially parallelized. The ranking performance of retargeted matrix factorization is evaluated on benchmark movie recommendation datasets and results in superior ranking performance compared to collaborative filtering algorithms specifically designed to optimize ranking metrics.},

We report on preliminary experiments with this modified objective, in which the minimisation is carried out using stochastic gradient descent.

 abstract = {The fast development of computing and communication has reformed the financial markets' dynamics. Nowadays many people are investing and trading stocks through online channels and having access to real-time market information efficiently. There are more opportunities to lose or make money with all the stocks information available throughout the World; however, one should spend a lot of effort and time to follow those stocks and the available instant information. This paper presents a preliminary regarding a multi-agent recommender system for computational investing. This system utilizes a hybrid filtering technique to adaptively recommend the most profitable stocks at the right time according to investor's personal favour. The hybrid technique includes collaborative and content-based filtering. The content-based model uses investor preferences, influencing macro-economic factors, stocks profiles and the predicted trend to tailor to its advices. The collaborative filter assesses the investor pairs' investing behaviours and actions that are proficient in economic market to recommend the similar ones to the target investor.},

 abstract = {We describe a hybrid recommendation system at LinkedIn that seeks to optimally extract relevant information pertaining to items to be recommended. By extending the notion of an item profile, we propose the concept of a "virtual profile" that augments the content of the item with rich set of features inherited from members who have already shown explicit interest in it. Unlike item-based collaborative filtering, we focus on discovering the characteristic descriptors that underlie the item-user association. Such information is used as supplemental features in a content-based filtering system. The main objective of virtual profiles is to provide a means to tap into rich-content information from one type of entity and propagate features extracted from which to other affiliated entities that may suffer from relative data scarcity. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on a real-world community recommendation problem at LinkedIn. The result shows that the virtual profiles outperform a collaborative filtering based approach (user who likes this also likes that). In particular, the improvement is more significant for new users with only limited connections, demonstrating the capability of the method to address the cold-start problem in pure collaborative filtering systems.},

Unfortunately, Maximum Coverage is NP-complete but an efficient approximation algorithm exists based on the Greedy methodology. We exhibit test results from the Greedy method on real data sets showing 3-8% increase in sales using the Maximum Coverage optimization method in comparison to the standard best-seller list.

In this paper, we investigate a novel efficient and scalable online collaborative filtering technique for on-the-fly recommender systems, which is able to effectively online update the recommendation model from a sequence of rating observations. Specifically, we propose a family of online multi-task collaborative filtering (OMTCF) algorithms, which tackle the online collaborative filtering task by exploiting the similar principle as online multitask learning. Encouraging empirical results on large-scale datasets showed that the proposed technique is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

 abstract = {One important challenge of current search engines is to satisfy the users' needs when they provide a poorly formulated query. When the pages matching the user's original keywords are judged to be unsatisfactory, query recommendation techniques are used to propose alternative queries and alter the result set. These techniques search for queries that are semantically similar to the user's original query, often searching for keywords that are similar to the keywords given by the user. However, when the original query is sufficiently ill-posed, the user's informational need is best met using entirely different keywords, and a substantially different query may be necessary. We propose a novel approach that is not based on the keywords of the original query. We intentionally seek out orthogonal queries, which are related queries that have (almost) no common terms with the user's query. This allows an orthogonal query to satisfy the user's informational need when small perturbations of the original keyword set are insufficient. By using this technique to generate query recommendations, we outperform several known approaches, being the best for long tail queries.},

The study of the proposed algorithm has been conducted on data from the Million Songs Dataset (MSD) challenge whose task was to suggest a set of songs (out of more than 380k available songs) to more than 100k users given half of the user listening history and complete listening history of other 1 million people. In particular, we investigate on the entire recommendation pipeline, starting from the definition of suitable similarity and scoring functions and suggestions on how to aggregate multiple ranking strategies to define the overall recommendation.

Recent studies have shown that recommender systems have a positive effect on the provider's revenue. In this paper we show that by providing a set of recommendations different than the one perceived best according to user acceptance rate, the recommendation system can further increase the business' utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content. We performed a large body of experiments comparing a commercial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified recommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible reduce in satisfaction by providing the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Differences in user satisfaction between the lists is negligible, and not statistically significant. We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them.},

Although the recent selections are usually assumed to have higher impact on the recommendation accuracy, empirical studies on this problem are limited. For old data, whether they can contribute to the recommendation accuracy is still to be determined. On one hand, changes in short-term user preference over time may limit their effectiveness in prediction, but on the other hand, one cannot rule out their potential in capturing long term user preferences. The result is important for the system owner to determine which data is useful to make the recommendation accurately. While there have been some related studies on the time dependency of data quality using neighbor-based CF methods (e.g., [4]), its effects remain unverified for other CF methods. In this paper, we study the effect of data generated over different time period on recommendation precision using several popular model-based CF algorithms (latent factor models). experiment results show that while more recent data expectedly have larger impacts, the usefulness of older data cannot be ignored as long as there are sufficient old samples.

The advantage over learning methods such as coordinate descent/alternating least-squares (ALS) or (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) is that MCMC takes uncertainty into account and moreover MCMC can easily integrate priors to learn regularization values. For factorization models, MCMC inference can be done with efficient Gibbs samplers. However, MCMC algorithms are not point estimators, but they generate a chain of models. The whole chain of models is used to calculate predictions. For large scale models like factorization methods with millions or billions of model parameters, saving the whole chain of models is very storage intensive and can even get infeasible in practice. In this paper, we address this problem and show how a small subset from the chain of models can approximate the predictive distribution well. We use the fact that models from the chain are correlated and propose online selection techniques to store only a small subset of the models. We perform an empirical analysis on the large scale Netflix dataset with several Bayesian factorization models, including matrix factorization and SVD++. We show that the proposed selection techniques approximate the predictions well with only a small subset of model samples.},

In our study, we introduce interfaces that provide these methods of support. We also present a set of methodologies to evaluate the efficacy of the new interfaces via a user experiment. Our results suggest that presenting exemplars during the rating process helps users rate more consistently, and increases the quality of the data.},

 abstract = {One of the most challenging recommendation tasks is recommending to a new, previously unseen user. This is known as the user cold start problem. Assuming certain features or attributes of users are known, one approach for handling new users is to initially model them based on their features. Motivated by an ad targeting application, this paper describes an extreme online recommendation setting where the cold start problem is perpetual. Every user is encountered by the system just once, receives a recommendation, and either consumes or ignores it, registering a binary reward. We introduce One-pass Factorization of Feature Sets, 'OFF-Set', a novel recommendation algorithm based on Latent Factor analysis, which models users by mapping their features to a latent space. OFF-Set is able to model non-linear interactions between pairs of features, and updates its model per each recommendation-reward observation in a pure online fashion. We evaluate OFF-Set against several state of the art baselines, and demonstrate its superiority on real ad-targeting data.},

@inproceedings{McAuley:2013:HFH:2507157.2507163,
 abstract = {In order to recommend products to users we must ultimately predict how a user will respond to a new product. To do so we must uncover the implicit tastes of each user as well as the properties of each product. For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wizards, as well as the user's level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user's rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems) with latent review topics (such as those learned by topic models like LDA). Our approach has several advantages. Firstly, we obtain highly interpretable textual labels for latent rating dimensions, which helps us to `justify' ratings with text. Secondly, our approach more accurately predicts product ratings by harnessing the information present in review text; this is especially true for new products and users, who may have too few ratings to model their latent factors, yet may still provide substantial information from the text of even a single review. Thirdly, our discovered topics can be used to facilitate other tasks such as automated genre discovery, and to identify useful and representative reviews.},

 abstract = {Context aware recommender systems go beyond the traditional personalized recommendation models by incorporating a form of situational awareness. They provide recommendations that not only correspond to a user's preference profile, but that are also tailored to a given situation or context. We consider the setting in which contextual information is represented as a subset of an item feature space describing short-term interests or needs of a user in a given situation. This contextual information can be provided by the user in the form of an explicit query, or derived implicitly. We propose a unified probabilistic model that integrates user profiles, item representations, and contextual information. The resulting recommendation framework computes the conditional probability of each item given the user profile and the additional context. These probabilities are used as recommendation scores for ranking items. Our model is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that provides the capability for joint modeling of users, items, and the meta-data associated with contexts. Each user profile is modeled as a mixture of the latent topics. The discovered latent topics enable our system to handle missing data in item features. We demonstrate the application of our framework for article and music recommendation. In the latter case, the set of popular tags from social tagging Web sites are used for context descriptions. Our evaluation results show that considering context can help improve the quality of recommendations.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 6th ACM Recommender Systems Conference (ACM RecSys 2012), held in Dublin, Ireland on September 9-13. As RecSys enters the second half of its first decade, it has clearly established itself as the premier international venue for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. The growing maturity of the conference is reflected through several changes in the program as compared to previous years: the tutorial program includes four exciting tutorials, which, for the first time, were not invited, but rather submitted and rigorously reviewed. We also put a special emphasis on soliciting demonstrations, leading to a record number of 10 demos accepted to the conference. In addition, this year continues the tradition of attractive collocated workshops, with a total of 8. Finally, 8 PhD students have been accepted to participate in the Doctoral Symposium. In parallel to growing and diversifying participation opportunities, the selectivity of the short paper track was substantially increased, while the competitive acceptance rate of the long paper track was maintained. Overall, the number of paper submissions went up almost 10% as compared to last year, with a total of 185 submissions. Out of 119 full paper submissions, 24 were accepted (20.2%) for oral presentation at the conference. Out of 66 short paper submissions, 21 were accepted (31.8%) for poster presentation at the conference. 5 of these 21 have been identified as industry short papers, highlighting the fact that their main contribution lies in the description of a real system, typically already in wide use. The conference program includes two keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Jure Leskovec (Stanford University) and one from an industrial perspective by Ron Kohavi (Microsoft). The Industry program also includes a rich set of talks by Ralf Herbrich (Facebook), Ronny Lempel (Yahoo! Research), Sumanth Kolar (StumbleUpon), Anmol Bhasin (LinkedIn), Thore Graepel (Microsoft Research), and Paul Lamere (The Echo Nest).},

Users tend to be overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available, especially with limited browsing options perceived in many event web services. To alleviate this information overload, a recommender system becomes a vital component for assisting users selecting relevant events. However, such system faces a number of challenges owed to the the inherent complex nature of an event. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach built on top of Semantic Web. On the one hand, we use a content-based system enriched with Linked Data to overcome the data sparsity, a problem induced by the transiency of events. On the other hand, we incorporate a collaborative filtering to involve the social aspect, an influential feature in decision making. This hybrid system is enhanced by the integration of a user diversity model designed to detect user propensity towards specific topics. We show how the hybridization of CB+CF systems and the integration of interest diversity features are important to improve predictions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using precision and recall measures.},

 abstract = {Many online systems present a list of recommendations and infer user interests implicitly from clicks or other contextual actions. For modeling user feedback in such settings, a common approach is to consider items acted upon to be relevant to the user, and irrelevant otherwise. However, clicking some but not others conveys an implicit ordering of the presented items. Pairwise learning, which leverages such implicit ordering between a pair of items, has been successful in areas such as search ranking. In this work, we study whether pairwise learning can improve community recommendation. We first present two novel pairwise models adapted from logistic regression. Both offline and online experiments in a large real-world setting show that incorporating pairwise learning improves the recommendation performance. However, the improvement is only slight. We find that users' preferences regarding the kinds of communities they like can differ greatly, which adversely affect the effectiveness of features derived from pairwise comparisons. We therefore propose a probabilistic latent semantic indexing model for pairwise learning (Pairwise PLSI), which assumes a set of users' latent preferences between pairs of items. Our experiments show favorable results for the Pairwise PLSI model and point to the potential of using pairwise learning for community recommendation.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for boosting collaborative filtering by integrating spatial information about geo-referenced items (e.g., photos). In particular, we developed a method to estimate missing ratings by propagating an item's neighbor's ratings based on the similarity of geospatial information. An empirical evaluation shows that geospatial information significantly improves recommendation results, and its contribution grows with the ratings data's level of sparseness. We illustrate the usefulness of the method for a photo recommendation task using data obtained from two popular photo-sharing websites: Flickr and Panoramio. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods indicates the superiority of the proposed method, implying that geospatial information should be considered, when available.},

 abstract = {Classical matrix factorization approaches to collaborative filtering learn a latent vector for each user and each item, and recommendations are scored via the similarity between two such vectors, which are of the same dimension. In this work, we are motivated by the intuition that a user is a much more complicated entity than any single item, and cannot be well described by the same representation. Hence, the variety of a user's interests could be better captured by a more complex representation. We propose to model the user with a richer set of functions, specifically via a set of latent vectors, where each vector captures one of the user's latent interests or tastes. The overall recommendation model is then nonlinear where the matching score between a user and a given item is the maximum matching score over each of the user's latent interests with respect to the item's latent representation. We describe a simple, general and efficient algorithm for learning such a model, and apply it to large scale, real-world datasets from YouTube and Google Music, where our approach outperforms existing techniques.},

Content-based features play a central role in mitigating the ``cold start'' problem in commercial recommenders. They are also useful in other related tasks, such as recommendation explanation and visualization. However, traditional feature selection methods do not generalize well to recommender systems. As a result, commercial systems typically use manually crafted and selected features. This work presents a framework for automated selection of informative content-based features, that is independent of the type of recommender system or the type of features. We evaluate on recommenders from different domains: books, movies and smart-phone apps, and show effective results on each. In addition, we show how to use the proposed methods to generate meaningful features from text.},

Since many of these patients cannot express their personal preferences, a recommender system can assist the caregivers in the selection of the menu items that match the patients' preferences. Recommendations are generated based on three information sources: explicit ratings for menu items, implicit feedback based on the patient's eating behavior and the amount of food that was eaten, and inferred preferences for the ingredients of the menu items. In addition, monitoring the amount of food that was eaten by each patient can provide insights into the optimal amount of each menu item that has to be served to each patient. Furthermore, monitoring food consumption allows to detect irregularities in the eating behavior of the patient, which can be a symptom of illness.},

 abstract = {Power users, in a Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender System (RS) context, are those who can exert considerable influence over the recommendation outcomes presented to other users. RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase decisions. Thus, RS research in this area has focused on power user identification and utilization to address challenges such as rating sparsity for new items or users. But, as ever, there remains the potential for corruption of power. Alongside accuracy and efficiency measures, RS robustness to manipulation or 'attack' has been studied using injection of false user profiles. Our research is investigating the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when simulated power users provide biased ratings for new items. In this study, we introduce the notion of a 'Power User Attack' for RS robustness analysis, as well as a novel use of social networking degree centrality concepts for identifying RS power users. Initial results show that power users identified using in-degree centrality, compared to other techniques, can be more influential as reflected by accuracy and robustness impacts before and after power user attacks.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2014) held between October 6th and 10th in Foster City, Silicon Valley, U.S.A. The annual RecSys conference is the premier international forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their challenges, research results, and experiences in the broad field of recommender systems. RecSys 2014 features keynote talks, research paper presentations, industry sessions, poster sessions, workshops, tutorials, demonstrations, a doctoral symposium, and the RecSys Challenge. The success of a conference largely depends on the quality of the submitted works. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the authors for submitting their original research to Recsys 2014. The RecSys conference has seen remarkable growth since its inception as Recommenders 06 Summer School on the Present and Future of Recommender Systems. It has evolved into a full-fledged, top research conference since 2007, underscoring the increasing role and significant challenges related to recommender systems. This year we received a record number of 234 submissions and accepted 35 long papers for oral presentation (acceptance rate 23%) and 20 short papers for poster presentation (acceptance rate 24%). The RecSys conference is driven by real-world challenges. The key topics covered in this year's research program include ranking and top-n recommendations (7.5% of papers), matrix factorization (5.6%), cold start (5.6%), implicit feedback (4.3%), context awareness (3.6%), metrics and evaluation (3.5%), novel applications (2.9%), and more. The quality of a conference program also depends on the competence and hard work of its devoted volunteers. To select the 55 accepted papers out of the initial 234 submissions, this year, we implemented a two-tier review process, where each paper received detailed reviews from three program committee members, followed by a meta-review by a senior program committee member. Our entire committee involved 20 senior and 102 regular Program Committee members. We are extremely grateful to all the PC members for volunteering their time to generate more than 900 detailed and insightful reviews and discussions. In addition to the technical paper program, the program provides a diverse array of exciting venues for our attendees to interact with top experts from academia and industry on topics related to recommender systems. We are very fortunate to have three world-class keynote speakers this year spanning industry and academia, providing inspirational talks on cutting-edge challenges and directions in the field. We also feature an industry program capitalizing on being located in Silicon Valley's backyard. The invited industry speakers include renowned executives from top Silicon Valley companies, and representatives of new age companies using Recommender Systems in unique and disruptive ways. In addition, this year's program will host an industry panel discussing the topic of using smart systems monitoring and guiding our socio-digital experience. Our poster and demonstration event showcases numerous posters and nine live system demonstrations. Before and after the main conference, four tutorials and nine workshops will be held, including the RecSys Challenge. In addition, nine students were selected and invited to participate in the doctoral symposium of the conference.},

The main strategic goal of such social connections is to boost user interaction and adoption on social media. However only a few efforts have been focused so far on leveraging users' social profiles to personalize the e-commerce experience and to recommend products of interest. In this paper, we start exploring this topic by investigating if a user's social media profile can be used to predict and recommend what type of products and what brands the social user is more likely to buy. More specifically, we study the correlation between the brands liked by the user on social media sites and those purchased on an e-commerce site. We then leverage these correlations in a brand prediction system, showing that social media can be effectively used to recommend branded products when user-user collaborative filtering techniques are used.},

Secondly, we aim to make better use of user ratings and introduce a novel Bayesian similarity measure by taking into account both the direction and length of rating vectors.

However, most existing reciprocal recommenders use either profile similarity or interaction similarity to recommend new matches, without considering temporal features. In this paper we introduce a method for temporal reciprocal recommender systems using Hidden Markov Models to generate recommendations. Instead of summarising the whole historical data in one past state, we propose a model that formalises historical data on interactions as a series of successive states changing over time and then tries to find the recommended next state. We have implemented this new approach and the results of testing on industrial-scale data from a real dating website show a noticeable improvement over the previous best-performing recommenders.},

However, most such studies only consider a single type of relationship, e.g., social network. Notice that in many applications, the recommendation problem exists in an attribute-rich heterogeneous information network environment. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose to combine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to provide high quality recommendation results. The major challenge of building recommender systems in heterogeneous information networks is to systematically define features to represent the different types of relationships between entities, and learn the importance of each relationship type. In the proposed framework, we first use meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different paths in the related information network. We then define a recommendation model with such latent features and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the model. Empirical studies show that our approach outperforms several widely employed implicit feedback entity recommendation techniques.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a set of algorithms used for music recommendations and personalization in a general purpose social network www.ok.ru, the second largest social network in the CIS visited by more then 40 millions users per day. In addition to classical recommendation features like "recommend a sequence" and "find similar items" the paper describes novel algorithms for construction of context aware recommendations, personalization of the service, handling of the cold-start problem, and more. All algorithms described in the paper are working on-line and are able to detect and address changes in the user's behavior and needs in the real time. The core component of the algorithms is a taste graph containing information about different entities (users, tracks, artists, etc.) and relations between them (for example, user A likes song B with certainty X, track B created by artist C, artist C is similar to artist D with certainty Y and so on). Using the graph it is possible to select tracks a user would most probably like, to arrange them in a way that they match each other well, to estimate which items from a fixed list are most relevant for the user, and more. In addition, the paper describes the approach used to estimate algorithms efficiency and analyze the impact of different recommendation related features on the users' behavior and overall activity at the service.},

The suggested hybrid approach combines two techniques -- one based on representing both POIs and music with tags, and the other based on the knowledge of the semantic relations between the two types of items. We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of two well-known, highly scalable factorized models: SVD++ and Asymmetric-SVD++. These are cutting-edge factorized models that have played a key role in the Netflix prize winner's solution. We first employ collaborative information to categorize the users and items. We then discover the shared interests between these categories. Including this new information, we extend these cutting-edge models regarding two main goals: 1) to improve their recommendation accuracies; 2) to keep the extended models still scalable. Finally, we evaluate our proposed models on two recommendation datasets: MovieLens100k, and Netflix. Our experiment shows that adding the shared interests among categories into these models improves their accuracy while maintaining scalability.},

 abstract = {The application a smart phone user will launch next intuitively depends on the sequence of apps used recently. More generally, when users interact with systems such as shopping websites or online radio, they click on items that are of interest in the current context. We call the sequence of clicks made in the current session interactional context. It is desirable for a recommender system to use the context set by the user to update recommendations. Most current context-aware recommender systems focus on a relatively less dynamic representational context defined by attributes such as season, location and tastes. In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative filtering with interactional context, where the goal is to make personalized and dynamic recommendations to a user engaged in a session. To this end, we propose the methodname algorithm that works in two stages. First, users are clustered by their transition behavior (one-step Markov transition probabilities between items), and cluster-level Markov models are computed. Then personalized PageRank is computed for a given user on the corresponding cluster Markov graph, with a personalization vector derived from the current context. We give an interpretation of the second stage of the algorithm as adding an appropriate context bias, in addition to click bias (or rating bias), to a classical neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model, where the neighborhood is determined from a Markov graph. Experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm, where we achieve at least 20% (up to 37%) improvement over competitive methods in the recall level at top-20.},

The first attribute is called user hardship. This is a novel attribute, particularly relevant to location datasets, that indicates how burdensome a data point was to achieve.

Nevertheless, different users may be interested in the same object for different reasons---for instance, the Star Wars movies may appeal to both adventure as well as to fantasy movie fans. In this situation, a sensible strategy is to provide a user with diverse recommendations of how to tag the object. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending relevant and diverse tags as a ranking problem. In particular, we propose a novel tag recommendation approach that explicitly takes into account the possible topics (e.g., categories) underlying an object in order to promote tags with high coverage and low redundancy with respect to these topics. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed approach using data collected from two popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, LastFM and MovieLens. Our experimental results attest the effectiveness of our approach at promoting more relevant and diverse tags in contrast to state-of-the-art relevance-based methods as well as a recently proposed method that takes both relevance and diversity into account.},

In such setups, given a single item of interest, the system needs to provide other related items, following patterns like "people who liked this also liked...". While item-oriented systems are central in their importance, they have been approached so far using very basic tools. We identify several hurdles faced by standard approaches to the item-oriented task. First, the sparseness of observed activities prevents establishing reliable similarity relations for many item pairs. Second, we address a scalability challenge at the retrieval stage present in many real-world systems: Given an item inventory, which may encompass millions of items, it is desired to identify the most related item pairs in a sub-quadratic time. This work addresses these two challenges, thereby improving both accuracy and scalability of item-oriented recommenders. Additionally, we propose an empirical evaluation scheme for comparing the quality of different solutions with encouraging results.},

 abstract = {Online reviews play a vital role in the decision-making process for online users. Helpful reviews are usually buried in a large number of unhelpful reviews, and with the consistently increasing number of reviews, it becomes more and more difficult for online users to find helpful reviews. Therefore most online review websites allow online users to rate the helpfulness of a review and a global helpfulness score is computed for the review based on its available ratings. However, in reality, user-specified helpfulness ratings for reviews are very sparse - a few reviews attract large numbers of helpfulness ratings while most reviews obtain few or even no helpfulness ratings. The available helpfulness ratings are too sparse for online users to assess the helpfulness of reviews. Also the helpfulness of a review is not necessarily equally useful for all users and users with different background may treat the helpfulness of a review very differently. The user idiosyncracy of review helpfulness motivates us to study the problem of review helpfulness rating prediction in this paper. We first identify various types of context information, model them mathematically, and propose a context-aware review helpfulness rating prediction framework CAP. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of context awareness in solving the review helpfulness rating prediction problem.},
