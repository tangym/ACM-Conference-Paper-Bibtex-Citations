 abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) take contextual conditions into account when providing item recommendations. In recent years, context-aware matrix factorization (CAMF) has emerged as an extension of the matrix factorization technique that also incorporates contextual conditions. In this paper, we introduce another matrix factorization approach for contextual recommendations, the contextual SLIM (CSLIM) recommendation approach. It is derived from the sparse linear method (SLIM) which was designed for Top-N recommendations in traditional recommender systems. Based on the experimental evaluations over several context-aware data sets, we demonstrate that CLSIM can be an effective approach for context-aware recommendations, in many cases outperforming state-of-the-art CARS algorithms in the Top-N recommendation task.},

User interests are however often unique and depend on many unobservable factors including a user's mood and the local weather. We take a contextual session-based approach and propose a sequential framework using factored Markov decision processes (fMDPs) to detect the user's goal (the topic) of a session. We show that an independence assumption on the attributes of items leads to a set of independent models that can be optimised efficiently. Our approach results in interpretable topics that can be effectively turned into recommendations. Empirical results on a real world click log from a large e-commerce company exhibit highly accurate topic prediction rates of about 90%. Translating our approach into a topic-driven recommender system outperforms several baseline competitors.},

Such approaches mainly use the trust scores explicitly expressed by users. However, it is often challenging to have users provide explicit trust scores of each other. There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust Metrics (TM) to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their interactions. In this paper, we first evaluate several TMs to find out which one can best predict trust scores compared to the actual trust scores explicitly expressed by users. And, second, we propose to incorporate these trust scores inferred from the candidate TMs into social matrix factorization (MF). We investigate if incorporating the implicit trust scores in MF can make rating prediction as accurate as the MF on explicit trust scores. The reported results support the idea of employing implicit trust into MF whenever explicit trust is not available, since the performance of both models is similar.},

Delivering such personalized user experiences is believed to increase the long term engagement of users. While there has been a lot of progress in designing effective personalized recommender systems, by exploiting user interests and historical interaction data through implicit (item click) or explicit (item rating) feedback, directly optimizing for users' satisfaction with the system remains challenging. In this paper, we explore the idea of using item-level dwell time as a proxy to quantify how likely a content item is relevant to a particular user. We describe a novel method to compute accurate dwell time based on client-side and server-side logging and demonstrate how to normalize dwell time across different devices and contexts. In addition, we describe our experiments in incorporating dwell time into state-of-the-art learning to rank techniques and collaborative filtering models that obtain competitive performances in both offline and online settings.},

 abstract = {Recommendation techniques have been well developed in the past decades. Most of them build models only based on user item rating matrix. However, in real world, there is plenty of auxiliary information available in recommendation systems. We can utilize these information as additional features to improve recommendation performance. We refer to recommendation with auxiliary information as context-aware recommendation. Context-aware Factorization Machines (FM) is one of the most successful context-aware recommendation models. FM models pairwise interactions between all features, in such way, a certain feature latent vector is shared to compute the factorized parameters it involved. In practice, there are tens of context features and not all the pairwise feature interactions are useful. Thus, one important challenge for context-aware recommendation is how to effectively select "good" interaction features. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem and propose a greedy interaction feature selection algorithm based on gradient boosting. Then we propose a novel Gradient Boosting Factorization Machine (GBFM) model to incorporate feature selection algorithm with Factorization Machines into a unified framework. The experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

For example, for conference program chairs and journal editors, in order to collect "good" judgments for a paper, it is necessary for them to assign the paper to the most appropriate reviewers. Choosing appropriate reviewers of course includes a number of considerations such as expertise and authority, but also diversity and avoiding conflicts. In this paper, we explore the expert retrieval problem and implement an automatic paper-reviewer recommendation system that considers aspects of expertise, authority, and diversity. In particular, a graph is first constructed on the possible reviewers and the query paper, incorporating expertise and authority information. Then a Random Walk with Restart (RWR) [1] model is employed on the graph with a sparsity constraint, incorporating diversity information. Extensive experiments on two reviewer recommendation benchmark datasets show that the proposed method obtains performance gains over state-of-the-art reviewer recommendation systems in terms of expertise, authority, diversity, and, most importantly, relevance as judged by human experts.},

We focus on implicit feedback where preferences are given in the form of binary events/ratings. Differently from state-of-the-art methods, the method proposed is designed to optimize the AUC directly within a margin maximization paradigm. Specifically, this turns out in a simple constrained quadratic optimization problem, one for each user.

Yet, in the field of recommender systems, there still exists considerable disparity in evaluation methods, metrics and experimental designs, as well as a significant mismatch between evaluation methods in the lab and what constitutes an effective recommendation for real users and businesses. Even after the relevant quality dimensions have been defined, a clear evaluation protocol should be specified in detail and agreed upon, allowing for the comparison of results and experiments conducted by different authors. This would enable any contribution to the same problem to be incremental and add up on top of previous work, rather than grow sideways.

As RecSys enters the second half of its first decade, it has clearly established itself as the premier international venue for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. The growing prestige of the conference is reflected by the significant increase in the number of papers that were submitted to the technical program. The overall number of paper submissions went up 20% as compared to last year, with a total of 222 submissions. We received 136 full paper submissions, from which 32 were accepted (23.5%) for oral presentation and 18 were accepted as short papers and poster presentations. We received 80 short paper submissions, from which 24 were accepted (28.75%). Seven of these short papers were selected for short oral presentation and the remaining for poster presentation. For the first time this year, in addition to full and short papers, we also had a new category of submissions consisting of full-length industry papers. We received six papers in this category, out of which two papers were accepted and were presented during the industrial research session. To accommodate the large number of high-quality papers that we received and accepted, the number of research sessions has been increased to eight from the previous year's five sessions. Besides the technical program, the conference's overall program also includes tutorials, workshops, a doctoral symposium, and demonstrations. The tutorial program includes four exciting tutorials covering state-of-the-art methods for building recommender systems and emerging application areas. The workshop program includes eight different one-day workshops that take place the two days prior to the main conference. The doctoral symposium showcases the work of six PhD students, whose work has been selected after a rigorous review process. Finally, the demonstration program contains five different demonstrations covering various aspects of recommender systems. The conference program also includes three keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Oren Etzioni (University of Washington) and two from an industrial perspective by Dou Shen (Baidu) and Mu Yan (Beihe). Finally, continuing with the tradition of the conference, there is a strong integration of the research with its commercial applications. This is reflected through the strong participation of industry at the workshops, demonstrations, and technical program, as well as a special industrial session containing presentations of the accepted industry papers, invited talks, and panel discussions.},

As shown in previous work, the standard method called "Probabilistic Matrix Factorization" is based on a normal distribution assumption. While there exists work in which this method is extended to other distributions, these extensions are restrictive and we experimentally show on the basis of a real data set that it is worthwhile considering more general distributions which have not been used in the literature. Our contribution lies in providing a flexible and easy-to-use framework for matrix factorization with almost no limitation on the form of the distribution used. Our approach is based on maximum likelihood estimation and a key ingredient of our proposed method is automatic differentiation. This allows for the automatic derivation of the corresponding optimization algorithm, without the need to derive it manually for each distributional assumption while simultaneously being computationally efficient. Thus, with our method it is very easy to use a wide range of even complicated distributions for any data set.},

In real-data experiments with 30,000 users who purchased 80,000+ books and had 9,000,000+ Facebook friends and 6,000,000+ page likes, we show that using Facebook page likes for cold-start recommendation yields up to a 3-fold improvement in mean average precision (mAP) and up to 6-fold improvements in Precision@k and Recall@k compared to most-popular-item, demographic, and Facebook friend cold-start recommenders. These results demonstrate the substantial predictive power of social network content, and its significant utility in a challenging problem - recommendation for cold-start users.},

 abstract = {The emergence of what is called the social web and the continuing stream of new applications and community-based platforms including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others had a substantial impact on recommender systems research and practice over the last years in different ways. First, today's web users are more willing to share more about themselves than before the Web 2.0, thus providing more information sources that can be leveraged in the user modeling and recommendation process. Furthermore, the newly available information sources can not only be used to optimize the recommendations for an individual user, but can also help to identify more general patterns and trends in the behavior of the community that can be exploited by other applications. Second, personalization, information filtering and recommendation are often the central functionality of many of these social web based applications. On typical social networks, users for example get recommendations for news to read, songs to listen to, groups to join, friends to follow, people to connect or jobs that might be interesting. These developments lead to different challenges to be addressed in recommender systems research. On the one hand, for example, the question arises of how to effectively combine the huge variety of information sources for improved recommendations. On the other hand, regarding the new opportunities for applying recommender systems in social web environments, in many cases new techniques are required to address the particularities of the domain or to deal with scalability issues. The ACM RecSys 2014 Workshop on Recommender Systems and the Social Web aims to be a platform for researchers from academia and industry as well as for practitioners to present and discuss the various challenges and possible solutions related to all aspects of social web recommendations. The call for papers correspondingly covered a variety of topics in this area including all sorts of applications of recommender systems technology and their interfaces; collective knowledge creation and topic emergence;context-aware and group recommendation approaches; and case studies and empirical evaluations. This year's workshop was already the sixth in a series of successful workshops co-located with the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems since 2009. Again, we received several submissions from researchers from academia and industry which were thoroughly reviewed and selected for presentation at the workshop by a program committee of international experts in the field. The papers submitted to the workshop addressed a number of different topics and put forward novel proposals to build social web recommender system. In the context of applying recommendation technology to information personalization and resource ranking problems in Social Web environments, the submitted papers for example dealt with the problem of ranking community-provided product reviews based on opinion mining or with the recommendation of friends on social networks. As an example of how to leverage Social Web information to build better systems, one of the works proposed to analyze the characteristics of publicly shared music playlists to better understand how future music recommendation systems should be designed. Finally, another contribution from industry addressed challenges and lessons learned when building large-scale collaborative filtering solutions on Social Web platforms in a real-world environment.},

 abstract = {In several applications, user preferences can be fairly dynamic, since users tend to exploit a wide range of items and modify their tastes accordingly over time. In this paper, we model continuous user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences are dynamic and change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. We generate recommendations based on factorizing the tensor, by weighting the importance of past user preferences according to their UPD values. We additionally exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which can help improving the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled, tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses a real data set from last.fm, which allows us to demonstrate that user preferences can become very dynamic. Our experimental results show that the proposed method, by taking into account these dynamics, outperforms several baselines.},

@inproceedings{Kim:2014:BBM:2645710.2645754,
 abstract = {Collaborative prediction involves filling in missing entries of a user-item matrix to predict preferences of users based on their observed preferences. Most of existing models assume that the data is missing at random (MAR), which is often violated in recommender systems in practice. Incorrect assumption on missing data ignores the missing data mechanism, leading to biased inferences and prediction. In this paper we present a Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction, where the generative process for data and missing data mechanism are jointly modeled to handle non-random missing data. Missing data mechanism is modeled by three factors, each of which is related to users, items, and rating values. Each factor is modeled by Bernoulli random variable, and the observation of rating value is determined by the Boolean OR operation of three binary variables. We develop computationally-efficient variational inference algorithms, where variational parameters have closed-form update rules and the computational complexity depends on the number of observed ratings, instead of the size of the rating data matrix. We also discuss implementation issues on hyperparameter tuning and estimation based on empirical Bayes. Experiments on Yahoo! Music and MovieLens datasets confirm the useful behavior of our model by demonstrating that: (1) it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in yielding higher predictive performance; (2) it finds meaningful solutions instead of undesirable boundary solutions; (3) it provides rating trend analysis on why ratings are observed.},

 abstract = {The seminal 2003 paper by Cosley, Lab, Albert, Konstan, and Reidl, demonstrated the susceptibility of recommender systems to rating biases. To facilitate browsing and selection, almost all recommender systems display average ratings before accepting ratings from users which has been shown to bias ratings. This effect is called Social Inuence Bias (SIB); the tendency to conform to the perceived \norm" in a community. We propose a methodology to 1) learn, 2) analyze, and 3) mitigate the effect of SIB in recommender systems. In the Learning phase, we build a baseline dataset by allowing users to rate twice: before and after seeing the average rating. In the Analysis phase, we apply a new non-parametric significance test based on the Wilcoxon statistic to test whether the data is consistent with SIB. If significant, we propose a Mitigation phase using polynomial regression and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to predict unbiased ratings. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 9390 ratings from the California Report Card (CRC), a rating-based system designed to encourage political engagement. We found statistically significant evidence of SIB. Mitigating models were able to predict changed ratings with a normalized RMSE of 12.8% and reduce bias by 76.3%.

 abstract = {In this paper we give methods for time-aware music recommendation in a social media service with the potential of exploiting immediate temporal influences between users. We consider events when a user listens to an artist the first time and this event follows some friend listening to the same artist short time before. We train a blend of matrix factorization methods that model the relation of the influencer, the influenced and the artist, both the individual factor decompositions and their weight learned by variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Special care is taken since events of influence form a subset of the positive implicit feedback data and hence we have to cope with two different definitions of the positive and negative implicit training data. In addition, in the time-aware setting we have to use online learning and evaluation methods. While SGD can easily be trained online, evaluation is cumbersome by traditional measures since we will have potentially different top recommendations at different times. Our experiments are carried over the two-year "scrobble" history of 70,000 Last.fm users and show a 5% increase in recommendation quality by predicting temporal influences.},

 abstract = {Online social networks and mash-up services create opportunities to connect different web services otherwise isolated. Specifically in the case of news, users are very much exposed to news articles while performing other activities, such as social networking or web searching. Browsing behavior aimed at the consumption of news, especially in relation to the visits coming from other domains, has been mainly overlooked in previous work. To address that, we build a BrowseGraph out of the collective browsing traces extracted from a large viewlog of Yahoo News (0.5B entries), and we define the ReferrerGraph as its subgraph induced by the sessions with the same referrer domain. The structural and temporal properties of the graph show that browsing behavior in news is highly dependent on the referrer URL of the session, in terms of type of content consumed and time of consumption. We build on this observation and propose a news recommender that addresses the cold-start problem: given a user landing on a page of the site for the first time, we aim to predict the page she will visit next. We compare 24 flavors of recommenders belonging to the families of content-based, popularity-based, and browsing-based models. We show that the browsing-based recommender that takes into account the referrer URL is the best performing, achieving a prediction accuracy of 48% in conditions of heavy data sparsity.},

New decisions are made based on the observations of previous rewards. To maximize the total reward, one needs to solve the tradeoff between exploring different strategies and exploiting currently optimal strategies. This kind of tradeoff problems can be formalized as Multi-armed bandit problem. We recommend strategies in series and generate new recommendations based on noisy rewards of previous strategies. When the reward for a strategy is difficult to quantify, classical bandit algorithms are no longer optimal. This paper, studies the Multi-armed bandit problem with feedback given as a stochastic rank list instead of quantified reward values. We propose an algorithm for this new problem and show its optimality.

 abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) have been demonstrated to be able to enhance recommendations by adapting users' preferences to different contextual situations. In recent years, several CARS algorithms have been developed to incorporated into the recommender systems. For example, differential context modeling (DCM) was modified based on traditional neighborhood collaborative filtering (NBCF), context-aware matrix factorization (CAMF) coupled contextual dependency with the matrix factorization technique (MF), and tensor factorization directly models contexts as additional dimensions in the multi-dimensional space, etc. CAMF works well but it is difficult to interpret the latent features in the algorithm. DCM is good for explanation but it may only work well on data sets with dense contextual ratings. Recently, we successfully incorporate contexts into Sparse LInear Method (SLIM) and develop contextual SLIM (CSLIM) recommendation algorithms which take advantages of both NBCF and MF. CSLIM are demonstrated as more effective and promising context-aware recommenders. In this work, we provide the introduction on the framework of the CSLIM algorithms, present the current state of the research, and discuss our ongoing future work to develop and improve our CSLIM models for context-aware recommendations.},

 abstract = {A prominent approach in collaborative filtering based recommender systems is using dimensionality reduction (matrix factorization) techniques to map users and items into low-dimensional vectors. In such systems, a higher inner product between a user vector and an item vector indicates that the item better suits the user's preference. Traditionally, retrieving the most suitable items is done by scoring and sorting all items. Real world online recommender systems must adhere to strict response-time constraints, so when the number of items is large, scoring all items is intractable. We propose a novel order preserving transformation, mapping the maximum inner product search problem to Euclidean space nearest neighbor search problem. Utilizing this transformation, we study the efficiency of several (approximate) nearest neighbor data structures. Our final solution is based on a novel use of the PCA-Tree data structure in which results are augmented using paths one hamming distance away from the query (neighborhood boosting). The end result is a system which allows approximate matches (items with relatively high inner product, but not necessarily the highest one). We evaluate our techniques on two large-scale recommendation datasets, Xbox Movies and Yahoo~Music, and show that this technique allows trading off a slight degradation in the recommendation quality for a significant improvement in the retrieval time.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems suggest to users items that they might like (e.g., news articles, songs, movies) and, in doing so, they help users deal with information overload and enjoy a personalized experience. One of the main problems of these systems is the item cold-start, i.e., when a new item is introduced in the system and no past information is available, then no effective recommendations can be produced. The item cold-start is a very common problem in practice: modern online platforms have hundreds of new items published every day. To address this problem, we propose to learn Local Collective Embeddings: a matrix factorization that exploits items' properties and past user preferences while enforcing the manifold structure exhibited by the collective embeddings. We present a learning algorithm based on multiplicative update rules that are efficient and easy to implement. The experimental results on two item cold-start use cases: news recommendation and email recipient recommendation, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and show that it significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art methods for item cold-start.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems within social networks face three distinct challenges: suggesting what to consume/adopt, what to share and who to share it with. For all three cases, my and others' research work shows that people's decisions to adopt and share depend not only on their preferences for items, but also on social forces such as influence, conformity and identity management. Modeling the combined effects of people's preferences and social forces can lead to socially-aware recommender algorithms and interfaces as well more accurate models of information diffusion. I take a bottom-up approach to understanding how items are shared or adopted in a social network. First, I conduct behavioral experiments that give insights about, and allow to model the processes by which people decide to share or adopt items. Second, I use data from multiple social networking websites to validate and extend these models and develop tractable algorithms to predict people's decisions on items. This paper presents preliminary models for adoption and sharing along with future directions towards more accurate models. Results of my current work indicate that people consider their own preferences for items more than the recipients' when sharing and share only highly liked items. When adopting, people's preferences towards items matter, but so do annotations that accompany recommendations based on social influences; I show how their relative effects can be modeled as a mixture distribution.},

With the information embedded in the review text, we can alleviate the cold-start problem. Furthermore, our model is able to learn latent topics that are interpretable. With these interpretable topics, we can explore the prior knowledge on items or users and recommend completely "cold"' items.

 abstract = {In many application domains of recommender systems, explicit rating information is sparse or non-existent. The preferences of the current user have therefore to be approximated by interpreting his or her behavior, i.e., the implicit user feedback. In the literature, a number of algorithm proposals have been made that rely solely on such implicit feedback, among them Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR). In the BPR approach, pairwise comparisons between the items are made in the training phase and an item i is considered to be preferred over item j if the user interacted in some form with i but not with j. In real-world applications, however, implicit feedback is not necessarily limited to such binary decisions as there are, e.g., different types of user actions like item views, cart or purchase actions and there can exist several actions for an item over time. In this paper we show how BPR can be extended to deal with such more fine-granular, graded preference relations. An empirical analysis shows that this extension can help to measurably increase the predictive accuracy of BPR on realistic e-commerce datasets.},

In many recommendation and personalization applications, particularly in domains where user context changes dynamically, it is difficult to represent and model contextual factors directly, but it is often possible to observe their impact on user preferences during the course of users' interactions with the system. In this paper, we introduce an interactive recommender system that can detect and adapt to changes in context based on the user's ongoing behavior. The system, then, dynamically tailors its recommendations to match the user's most recent preferences. We formulate this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem and use Thompson sampling heuristic to learn a model for the user. Following the Thompson sampling approach, the user model is updated after each interaction as the system observes the corresponding rewards for the recommendations provided during that interaction. To generate contextual recommendations, the user's preference model is monitored for changes at each step of interaction with the user and is updated incrementally. We will introduce a mechanism for detecting significant changes in the user's preferences and will describe how it can be used to improve the performance of the recommender system.},

 abstract = {Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend suitable tags to a user for tagging an item. One of its main challenges is the effectiveness of its recommendations. Existing works focus on techniques for retrieving the most relevant tags to give beforehand, with a fixed number of tags in each recommended list. In this paper, we try to optimize the number of recommended tags in order to improve the efficiency of the recommendations. We propose a parameter-free algorithm for determining the optimal size of the recommended list. Thus we introduced some relevance measures to find the most relevant sublist from a given list of recommended tags. More precisely, we improve the quality of our recommendations by discarding some unsuitable tags and thus adjusting the list size. Our solution is an add-on one, which can be implemented on top of many kinds of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets, using four categories of tag recommenders, demonstrate the efficiency of our technique. For instance, the algorithm we propose outperforms the results of the task 2 of the ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 20091. By using the same tag recommender than the winners of the contest, we reach a F1 measure of 0.366 while the latter got 0.356. Thus, our solution yields significant improvements on the lists obtained from the tag recommenders.},

Problems students struggle with in the discussion forums, such as difficultly in finding interesting discussion opportunities or attracting helpers to address posted problems, provide new opportunities for recommender systems. In contrast to traditional product recommendation, question recommendation in discussion forums should simultaneously consider constraints on both students and questions. These considerations include (1) Load Balancing - students should not be over-burdened with too many requests; and (2) Expertise Matching - students should not be requested to address problems they are not capable of addressing. In this work, we formulate a novel constrained question recommendation problem to address the above considerations. We design a context-aware matrix factorization model to predict students' preferences over questions, then build a max cost flow model to manage the constraints. Experimental results conducted on three MOOC datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in optimizing overall forum welfare, and in predicting which specific questions students might be interested in.},

This methodology is a sharp departure from the traditional techniques of inferring interests of a user from the tweets that she posts or receives. We show that the topics of interest inferred by the proposed methodology are far superior than the topics extracted by state-of-the-art techniques such as using topic models (Labeled LDA) on tweets. Based upon the proposed methodology, we build a system Who Likes What, which can infer the interests of millions of Twitter users. To our knowledge, this is the first system that can infer interests for Twitter users at such scale.

We explore the inversion of the recommendation task as a means to enhance sales diversity - and indirectly novelty - by selecting which users an item should be recommended to instead of the other way around. We address the inverted task by two approaches: a) inverting the rating matrix, and b) defining a probabilistic reformulation which isolates the popularity component of arbitrary recommendation algorithms. We find that the first approach gives rise to interesting reformulations of nearest-neighbor algorithms, which essentially introduce a new neighbor selection policy. The second approach, as well as the first, ultimately result in substantial sales diversity enhancements, and improved trade-offs with recommendation precision and novelty. Two experiments on movie and music recommendation datasets show the effectiveness of the resulting approach, even when compared to direct optimization approaches of the target metrics proposed in prior work.},

One solution to this problem is to develop CTHC systems based on the principles of collaborative filtering, but this approach has not been widely studied.

 abstract = {Recommender systems research is often based on comparisons of predictive accuracy: the better the evaluation scores, the better the recommender. However, it is difficult to compare results from different recommender systems due to the many options in design and implementation of an evaluation strategy. Additionally, algorithmic implementations can diverge from the standard formulation due to manual tuning and modifications that work better in some situations. In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks. Our analysis points to large differences in recommendation accuracy across frameworks and strategies, i.e. the same baselines may perform orders of magnitude better or worse across frameworks. Our results show the necessity of clear guidelines when reporting evaluation of recommender systems to ensure reproducibility and comparison of results.},

We show that methods previously proposed for measuring and enhancing recommendation diversity - including those adapted from search result diversification - fail to address adequately these three properties.

We conduct an empirical study showing that the proposed method increases the coverage, dispersion, and diversity reinforcement of recommendations by selecting diverse sets of representative neighbors.

Promoting good reading habits among K-12 students is essential, given the enormous influence of reading on students' development as learners and members of society. In doing so, it is indispensable to provide readers with engaging and motivating reading selections. Unfortunately, existing book recommenders have failed to offer adequate choices for K-12 readers, since they either ignore the reading abilities of their users or cannot acquire the much-needed information to make recommendations due to privacy issues. To address these problems, we have developed Rabbit, a book recommender that emulates the readers' advisory service offered at school/public libraries. Rabbit considers the readability levels of its readers and determines the facets, i.e.,appeal factors, of books that evoke subconscious, emotional reactions on a reader. The design of Rabbit is unique, since it adopts a multi-dimensional approach to capture the reading abilities, preferences, and interests of its readers, which goes beyond the traditional book content/topical analysis. Conducted empirical studies have shown that Rabbit outperforms a number of (readability-based) book recommenders.},

Key challenges for recommender systems research are (a) to synthesize of all of this data into an integrated recommendation model and (b) to support a wide variety of recommendation types simultaneously (items, friends, tags, etc.) One approach that has been explored in recent research is to view this multi-faceted data as a heterogeneous network and use network-based methods of generating recommendations. However, most such approaches involve computationally-intensive model generation resulting in a single-purpose recommender system. Our approach is to create a component-based hybrid model whose components can be reused for multiple recommendation tasks.

These user-generated item lists complement the main functionality of the corresponding application, and intuitively become an alternative way for users to browse and discover interesting items to be consumed.

In this work, we study properties of these user-generated item lists and propose a Bayesian ranking model, called LIRE for recommending them. The proposed model takes into consideration users' previous interactions with both item lists and with individual items. Furthermore, we propose in LIRE a novel way of weighting items within item lists based on both position of items, and personalized list consumption pattern.

Many online vendors employ contextual bandit strategies to tackle the so-called exploration/exploitation dilemma rooted from the cold-start problem. However, due to high-dimensional user/item features and the underlying characteristics of bandit policies, it is often difficult for service providers to obtain and deploy an appropriate algorithm to achieve acceptable and robust economic profit. In this paper, we explore ensemble strategies of contextual bandit algorithms to obtain robust predicted click-through rate (CTR) of web objects. The ensemble is acquired by aggregating different pulling policies of bandit algorithms, rather than forcing the agreement of prediction results or learning a unified predictive model. To this end, we employ a meta-bandit paradigm that places a hyper bandit over the base bandits, to explicitly explore/exploit the relative importance of base bandits based on user feedbacks. Extensive empirical experiments on two real-world data sets (news recommendation and online advertising) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in terms of CTR.},

 abstract = {The advantage of Factorization Machines over other factorization models is their ability to easily integrate and efficiently exploit auxiliary information to improve Collaborative Filtering. Until now, this auxiliary information has been drawn from external knowledge sources beyond the user-item matrix. In this paper, we demonstrate that Factorization Machines can exploit additional representations of information inherent in the user-item matrix to improve recommendation performance. We refer to our approach as 'Free Lunch' enhancement since it leverages clusters that are based on information that is present in the user-item matrix, but not otherwise directly exploited during matrix factorization. Borrowing clustering concepts from codebook sharing, our approach can also make use of 'Free Lunch' information inherent in a user-item matrix from a auxiliary domain that is different from the target domain of the recommender. Our approach improves performance both in the joint case, in which the auxiliary and target domains share users, and in the disjoint case, in which they do not. Although 'Free Lunch' enhancement does not apply equally well to any given domain or domain combination, our overall conclusion is that Factorization Machines present an opportunity to exploit information that is ubiquitously present, but commonly under-appreciated by Collaborative Filtering algorithms.},

 abstract = {A group may appreciate recommendations on items that fit their joint preferences. When the members' actual preferences are unknown, a recommendation can be made with the aid of collaborative filtering methods. We offer to narrow down the recommended list of items by eliciting the users' actual preferences. Our final goal is to output top-k preferred items to the group out of the top-N recommendations provided by the recommender system (k), where one of the items is a necessary winner. We propose an iterative preference elicitation method, where users are required to provide item ratings per request. We suggest a heuristic that attempts to minimize the preference elicitation effort under two aggregation strategies. We evaluate our methods on real-world Netflix data as well as on simulated data which allows us to study different cases. We show that preference elicitation effort can be cut in up to 90% while preserving the most preferred items in the narrowed list.},

 abstract = {Recommender Systems (RS) are vulnerable to attack by malicious users who intend to bias the recommendations for their own benefit. Research in this area has developed attack models, detection methods, and mitigation schemes to understand and protect against such attacks. For Collaborative Filtering RSs, model-based approaches such as item-based and matrix-factorization were found to be more robust to many types of attack. Advice in designing for system robustness has thus been to employ model-based approaches. Our recent work with the Power User Attack (PUA), however, determined that attackers disguised as influential users can successfully attack (from the attacker's viewpoint) SVD-based recommenders, as well as user-based. But item-based systems remained robust to the PUA. In this paper we investigate a new, complementary attack model, the Power Item Attack (PIA), that uses influential items to successfully attack RSs. We show that the PIA is able to impact not only user-based and SVD-based recommenders but also the heretofore highly robust item-based approach, using a novel multi-target attack vector.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2014) held between October 6th and 10th in Foster City, Silicon Valley, U.S.A. The annual RecSys conference is the premier international forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their challenges, research results, and experiences in the broad field of recommender systems. RecSys 2014 features keynote talks, research paper presentations, industry sessions, poster sessions, workshops, tutorials, demonstrations, a doctoral symposium, and the RecSys Challenge. The success of a conference largely depends on the quality of the submitted works. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the authors for submitting their original research to Recsys 2014. The RecSys conference has seen remarkable growth since its inception as Recommenders 06 Summer School on the Present and Future of Recommender Systems. It has evolved into a full-fledged, top research conference since 2007, underscoring the increasing role and significant challenges related to recommender systems. This year we received a record number of 234 submissions and accepted 35 long papers for oral presentation (acceptance rate 23%) and 20 short papers for poster presentation (acceptance rate 24%). The RecSys conference is driven by real-world challenges. The key topics covered in this year's research program include ranking and top-n recommendations (7.5% of papers), matrix factorization (5.6%), cold start (5.6%), implicit feedback (4.3%), context awareness (3.6%), metrics and evaluation (3.5%), novel applications (2.9%), and more. The quality of a conference program also depends on the competence and hard work of its devoted volunteers. To select the 55 accepted papers out of the initial 234 submissions, this year, we implemented a two-tier review process, where each paper received detailed reviews from three program committee members, followed by a meta-review by a senior program committee member. Our entire committee involved 20 senior and 102 regular Program Committee members. We are extremely grateful to all the PC members for volunteering their time to generate more than 900 detailed and insightful reviews and discussions. In addition to the technical paper program, the program provides a diverse array of exciting venues for our attendees to interact with top experts from academia and industry on topics related to recommender systems. We are very fortunate to have three world-class keynote speakers this year spanning industry and academia, providing inspirational talks on cutting-edge challenges and directions in the field. We also feature an industry program capitalizing on being located in Silicon Valley's backyard. The invited industry speakers include renowned executives from top Silicon Valley companies, and representatives of new age companies using Recommender Systems in unique and disruptive ways. In addition, this year's program will host an industry panel discussing the topic of using smart systems monitoring and guiding our socio-digital experience. Our poster and demonstration event showcases numerous posters and nine live system demonstrations. Before and after the main conference, four tutorials and nine workshops will be held, including the RecSys Challenge. In addition, nine students were selected and invited to participate in the doctoral symposium of the conference.},

 abstract = {Real world large-scale recommender systems are always dynamic: new users and items continuously enter the system, and the status of old ones (e.g., users' preference and items' popularity) evolve over time. In order to handle such dynamics, we propose a recommendation framework consisting of an online component and an offline component, where the newly arrived items are processed by the online component such that users are able to get suggestions for fresh information, and the influence of longstanding items is captured by the offline component. Based on individual users' rating behavior, recommendations from the two components are combined to provide top-N recommendation. We formulate recommendation problem as a ranking problem where learning to rank is applied to extend upon matrix factorization to optimize item rankings by minimizing a pairwise loss function. Furthermore, to better model interactions between users and items, Latent Dirichlet Allocation is incorporated to fuse rating information and textual information. Real data based experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models by at least 61.21% and 50.27% in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) respectively.},

 abstract = {In 2006, Netflix announced a $1M prize competition to advance recommendation algorithms. The recommendation problem was simplified as the accuracy in predicting a user rating measured by the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). While that formulation helped get the attention of the research community in the area, it may have put an excessive focus on what is simply one of the many possible approaches to recommendations. In this tutorial we will describe different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized ranking, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or search as recommendation. We will use the Netflix use case as a driving example of a prototypical industrial-scale recommender system that has evolved from focusing on rating prediction to full page optimization. We will also review the usage of modern algorithmic approaches that include algorithms such as Factorization Machines [9], Restricted Boltzmann Machines [10], SimRank [7], Deep Neural Networks, or Listwise Learning-to-rank [6, 12, 11]. The original recommendation problem was formulated around the existence of explicit user ratings. However, recommender systems can be built using different kinds of data including implicit behavioral data, social connections, or demographics. In this tutorial we will review the usage of different data types and discuss what the availability of Big Data has brought into the research area. Finally, and also related to the availability of large quantities of data, we will talk about how system and architectural decisions play a role in understanding the recommender problem. This tutorial is in part based on recent publications by the author [5, 1, 8, 2, 4, 3].},

In the field of tourism this initial profiling becomes even more challenging. It has been shown that particularly in the beginning of the travel decision making process, users themselves are often not conscious of their needs and are not able to express them. In this paper, the basics of a picture-based approach are introduced that aims at revealing implicitly given user preferences. Based on a set of travel related pictures selected by a user, an individual travel profile is deduced. This is accomplished by mapping those pictures onto seven basic factors that reflect different travel behavioral aspects. Also tourism products can be represented by this seven factor model. Thus, this model constitutes the basis of our recommendation algorithm. First tests show that this non-verbal way of interaction is experienced as exiting and inspiring.},

Such an ability to provide heterogeneous cross-site recommendations may shed light on brand new and promising business models, which could benefit both the online shops in expanding the marketing efforts, and the online users in discovering items of interest from a wider scope.

We illustrate a new threat in which a recommender learns private attributes of users who do not voluntarily disclose them. We design both passive and active attacks that solicit ratings for strategically selected items, and could thus be used by a recommender system to pursue this hidden agenda. Our methods are based on a novel usage of Bayesian matrix factorization in an active learning setting. Evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that such attacks are indeed feasible and use significantly fewer rated items than static inference methods.

 abstract = {We present a novel component of a hybrid recommender system at LinkedIn, where item features are augmented by a virtual profile based on observed user-item interactions. A virtual profile is generated by representing an item in the user feature space and leveraging the overrepresented user features from users who interacted with the item. It is a way to think about Collaborative Filtering with content features. The core principle is that if the feature occurs with high probability for the users who interacted with an item (henceforth termed as relevant users) versus those who did not (henceforth termed as non-relevant users), then that feature is a good candidate to be included in the virtual profile of the item in question. However, this scheme suffers from the data imbalance problem because observed relevant users are usually an extremely small minority group compared to the whole user base. Feature selection in this skewed setting is prone to noise from the overwhelming non-relevant examples that belong to the majority group. To alleviate the problem, we propose a method to select the most relevant non-relevant examples from the majority group by segmenting users on certain intelligently selected feature dimensions. The resulting virtual profile from the method is called the segmented virtual profile. Empirical evaluation on a real-world large scale recommender system at LinkedIn shows that our strategies for segmentation yield significantly better results.},

We evaluate our approach on a dataset gathered fro Twitter that consists of tweets sent in one month during U.S. 2012 political campaign along with the "follows" relationship between users. Our first contribution is defining a set of sentiment-based features that help predict the likelihood of two users becoming "friends" (i.e., mutually mentioning or following each other) based on their sentiments toward topics of mutual interest. Our evaluation in a supervised learning framework demonstrates the benefits of sentiment-based features in link prediction. We find that Adamic-Adar and Euclidean distance measures are the best predictors. Our second contribution is proposing a factor graph model that incorporates a sentiment-based variant of cognitive balance theory. Our evaluation shows that, when tie strength is not too weak, our model is more effective in link prediction than traditional machine learning techniques.},

 abstract = {Recent developments in user evaluation of recommender systems have brought forth powerful new tools for understanding what makes recommendations effective and useful. We apply these methods to understand how users evaluate recommendation lists for the purpose of selecting an algorithm for finding movies. This paper reports on an experiment in which we asked users to compare lists produced by three common collaborative filtering algorithms on the dimensions of novelty, diversity, accuracy, satisfaction, and degree of personalization, and to select a recommender that they would like to use in the future. We find that satisfaction is negatively dependent on novelty and positively dependent on diversity in this setting, and that satisfaction predicts the user's final selection. We also compare users' subjective perceptions of recommendation properties with objective measures of those same characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies modern survey design and analysis techniques to a within-subjects, direct comparison study of recommender algorithms.},

 abstract = {Collaborative question answering (CQA) communities rely on user participation for their success. This paper presents a supervised Bayesian approach to model expertise in on-line CQA communities with application to question recommendation, aimed at reducing waiting times for responses and avoiding question starvation. We propose a novel algorithm called RankSLDA which extends the supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation model by considering a learning-to-rank paradigm. This allows us to exploit the inherent collaborative effects that are present in CQA communities where users tend to answer questions in their topics of expertise. Users can thus be modeled on the basis of the topics in which they demonstrate expertise. In the supervised stage of the method we model the pairwise order of expertise of users on a given question. We compare RankSLDA against several alternative methods on data from the Cross Validate community, part of the Stack Exchange network. RankSLDA outperforms all alternative methods by a significant margin.},

 abstract = {RapidMiner is a software tool that allows users to define data mining processes based on a visual model and implements a variety of so-called "operators" for data extraction, manipulation, model learning and analysis. The large number of available operators can however make it challenging for the process designer to find the appropriate operators for the problem at hand. At the same time, some operators are only meaningful when combined with certain others. In this work, we evaluate different strategies of recommending additional operators to the user during the design of the process. The recommendation models are learned using a pool of several thousand existing data mining processes and evaluated in an offline experiment. The results indicate that good predictive accuracy can already be achieved with comparably simple co-occurrence based algorithms.},

 abstract = {In this demonstration, we present a system that recommends to the user the locations and activities she/he might be interested in according to history GPS trajectories and public places of interest (POI) data. Its innovation lies in the acceptable performance of recommendations in cases where no user comments on activity types are available. Such situations are more realistic considering the restrictions on mobile devices' abilities, users' privacies, or business secret. For this purpose, we first extract stay points according to uses' trajectories, and label them with the top-k common activities which have the most possibility in terms of the POI dataset. Then, by taking stay points as observations, and activities as hidden states, a Hidden Markov model is built to learn the transfer possibilities between activities and the generation probabilities between activities and stay points. Finally, with the obtained model, our system can perform two types of recommendation, i.e. the history based recommendation and the similarity based recommendation. The results of former type are those stay points from user's own history positions. While, the latter one conducts collaborative filtering by taking history based recommendation results from similar users. The demonstration shows the running effects of the implemented prototype system, in which the Microsoft GeoLife trajectories dataset and the "DianPing.com" POI dataset were loaded. The preliminary experimental results demonstrate the feasibility.},

However, achieving personalization amidst diverse and rich environment within which learning takes place still remains a major challenge. Though adaption has been proposed to provide learners with learning experiences that are tailored to their particular educational needs, however, one of its limitation is user involvement. Absolute machine control is not always desirable considering the intellectual presence of human-beings. Furthermore learner engagement is one of crucial elements for realizing effective learning. Therefore, this study aims at exploring how context-awareness can support a personalized and engaged learning experience. The study in particular proposes the use of context-aware recommendation mechanism and the consideration of learner's preference to learning as approaches for achieving personalization and learner engagement.},
