The evaluation has been performed on the pay-per-view datasets collected by two IP-television providers over a period of several months. The analysis shows that item-based algorithms perform better with respect to SVD-based ones in the early stage of the cold-start problem. Moreover, the accuracy of SVD-based algorithms, when using few latent factors, decreases with the time-evolution of the dataset. On the contrary, the same algorithms used with a large-enough number of latent features increase their accuracy with time and may outperform the item-based algorithms.},

This algorithm aggregates scores by using users' relative preferences to search for a Kemeny-optimal ordering of items, and then uses this ordering to identify good and bad items, as well as those that are the subject of reviewer conflict. The algorithm uses variable-neighborhood local search, allowing the efficient discovery of high-quality consensus orderings while remaining computationally feasible.

 abstract = {A functional dependency is a logical relationship amongst the attributes that define a table of data. Specifically, a functional dependency holds when the values of a subset of the attributes in a dataset determine the values of one or more other attributes. Uncovering such dependencies is utilized in many domains, such as database design. We demonstrate that it can also be utilized in a recommendation context when datasets represent product catalogues. State-of-the-art approaches to discovering functional dependencies require a tabular representation of the data. However, product catalogues can sometimes be defined implicitly, for example, as a set of solutions to a combinatorial problem. Such combinatorial catalogues can have a very large number of products, thus making standard approaches to uncovering functional dependencies inapplicable. In this paper we present the first approach to computing functional dependencies over compiled knowledge representations which can often be small even for huge catalogues. In particular, we develop efficient algorithms that operate over decision diagrams, which allow us to handle catalogues that are out of reach for current approaches. We apply our algorithms to tabular and combinatorial benchmarks and detect a number of properties that could be considered as anomalies in product catalogues.},

 abstract = {With the exponential growth of Web contents, Recommender System has become indispensable for discovering new information that might interest Web users. Despite their success in the industry, traditional recommender systems suffer from several problems. First, the sparseness of the user-item matrix seriously affects the recommendation quality. Second, traditional recommender systems ignore the connections among users, which loses the opportunity to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations. In this paper, aiming at providing more realistic and accurate recommendations, we propose a factor analysis-based optimization framework to incorporate the user trust and distrust relationships into the recommender systems. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) We elaborate how user distrust information can benefit the recommender systems. (2) In terms of the trust relations, distinct from previous trust-aware recommender systems which are based on some heuristics, we systematically interpret how to constrain the objective function with trust regularization. (3) The experimental results show that the distrust relations among users are as important as the trust relations. The complexity analysis shows our method scales linearly with the number of observations, while the empirical analysis on a large Epinions dataset proves that our approaches perform better than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

They allow users to create tags that annotate and categorize content and share them with other users, very helpful in particular for searching multimedia content. However, as tagging is not constrained by a controlled vocabulary and annotation guidelines, tags tend to be noisy and sparse. Especially new resources annotated by only a few users have often rather idiosyncratic tags that do not reflect a common perspective useful for search. In this paper we introduce an approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for recommending tags of resources in order to improve search. Resources annotated by many users and thus equipped with a fairly stable and complete tag set are used to elicit latent topics to which new resources with only a few tags are mapped. Based on this, other tags belonging to a topic can be recommended for the new resource. Our evaluation shows that the approach achieves significantly better precision and recall than the use of association rules, suggested in previous work, and also recommends more specific tags. Moreover, extending resources with these recommended tags significantly improves search for new resources.},

 abstract = {An approach to user-based collaborative filtering is proposed that refines prediction of item ratings that is based on global user similarity by incorporating information derived from a more detailed user comparison made on the basis of Rated Item Pools (RIPs). The preference spectrum defined by items that a user has rated, and ranging from best-liked to most disliked items, is divided into item sets, or RIPs, which supply the basis for a fine-grained calculation of similarity between users. The RIP-based approach makes it possible for the model to take advantage of user tastes that are matched at one end of the spectrum, e.g., two users agree on favorites, without requiring complete correspondence of item ratings between user profiles. The approach improves rating prediction, as compared to a baseline that uses the global user similarity alone. It does not unduly inflate computational complexity or rely on external resources, common shortcomings of competing rating prediction methods. Cases in which the nearest neighbors are relatively dissimilar, known to be challenging for user-based collaborative filtering, demonstrate particularly substantial improvement. Performance is shown to be stable across the choice of neighborhood size, number of pools and relative pool size.},

As observed by recent research, traditional implementations of classic recommender approaches, such as collaborative filtering, are not working well in this new context. To address these challenges, a number of research groups worldwide work on adapting these approaches to the specific nature of collaborative tagging systems. In joining this stream of research, we have developed and compared three variants of user-based collaborative filtering algorithms to provide recommendations of articles on CiteULike. The first approach, Classic Collaborative filtering (CCF) uses Pearson correlation to calculate similarity between users and a classic adjusted ratings formula to rank the recommendations. The second approach, Neighbor-weighted Collaborative Filtering, takes into account the number of raters in the ranking formula of the recommendations. The third approach explores an innovative way to form the user neighborhood based on a modified version of the Okapi BM25 model over users' tags. Our results suggest that both alterations of CCF are beneficial. Incorporating the number of raters into the algorithms leads to an improvement of precision, while tag-based BM25 can be considered as an alternative to Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between users and their neighbors.},

Detection of more module mentions in conversations dramatically improved the quality of recommendations, even though the detection algorithm then had more false positives. Recommendations based on conversation co-mention were more effective than those based on co-installation, because co-installation data only led to recommendations of complementary modules and not substitutes.

 abstract = {We present an incentive-based architecture for providing recommendations in a social network. We maintain a distinct reputation system for each individual and we rely on users to identify appropriate correlations and rate the items using a system-provided recommendation language. The key idea is to design an incentive structure and a ranking system such that any inaccuracy in the recommendations implies the existence of a profitable arbitrage opportunity, hence making the system resistant to malicious spam and presentation bias. We also show that, under mild assumptions, our architecture provides users with incentive to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the ratings and the actual item qualities, quickly driving the system to an equilibrium state with accurate recommendations.},

First, iTag has much higher precision and recall than previously proposed tagging algorithms. For example, iTag achieved over 60% precision and recall on a set of 1000 blog posts selected at random from a WordPress RSS feed in April 2009, whereas the previously developed TagAssist achieved less than 10% precision and recall on our data. Second, iTag performs just as well when trained on a single user's blog as when trained on a large corpus of blogs. Thus, iTag can be deployed as a global, non-personalized tag recommendation system, or as a personalized tag recommender. Our experiments and survey of tagging behavior suggest that bloggers use tags idiosyncratically, so personalized tagging is an important option.},

 abstract = {Top-N item recommendation is one of the important tasks of recommenders. Collaborative filtering is the most popular approach to building recommender systems which can predict ratings for a given user and item. Collaborative filtering can be extended for top-N recommendation, but this approach does not work accurately for cold start users that have rated only a very small number of items. In this paper we propose novel methods exploiting a trust network to improve the quality of top-N recommendation. The first method performs a random walk on the trust network, considering the similarity of users in its termination condition. The second method combines the collaborative filtering and trust-based approach. Our experimental evaluation on the Epinions dataset demonstrates that approaches using a trust network clearly outperform the collaborative filtering approach in terms of recall, in particular for cold start users.},

Such tagging information may provide very useful information for item recommendation, because the users' interests in items can be implicitly reflected by the tags that they often use. Although some content-based recommender systems have made preliminary attempts recently to utilize tagging information to improve the recommendation performance, few recommender systems based on collaborative filtering (CF) have employed tagging information to help the item recommendation procedure. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called tag informed collaborative filtering (TagiCoFi), to seamlessly integrate tagging information into the CF procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that TagiCoFi outperforms its counterpart which discards the tagging information even when it is available, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Our recommender system exploits external social media to produce people and profile entry recommendations for new users. We present results of a live user study, showing that users who received recommendations at sign-up created more social connections, contributed more content, and were on the whole more engaged with the system, contributing more without prompt and returning more often.

We propose methods for explicit feedback that are able to handle 140,000 features when feature vectors are very sparse. With movie metadata collected for the NP movies we show that the prediction performance of the methods is comparable to that of CF, and can be used to predict user preferences on new movies. We also investigate the value of movie metadata compared to movie ratings in regards of predictive power. We compare our solely CBF approach with a simple baseline rating-based predictor. We show that even 10 ratings of a new movie are more valuable than its metadata for predicting user ratings.},

 abstract = {Content-based recommendation systems can provide recommendations for "cold-start" items for which little or no training data is available, but typically have lower accuracy than collaborative filtering systems. Conversely, collaborative filtering techniques often provide accurate recommendations, but fail on cold start items. Hybrid schemes attempt to combine these different kinds of information to yield better recommendations across the board. We describe unified Boltzmann machines, which are probabilistic models that combine collaborative and content information in a coherent manner. They encode collaborative and content information as features, and then learn weights that reflect how well each feature predicts user actions. In doing so, information of different types is automatically weighted, without the need for careful engineering of features or for post-hoc hybridization of distinct recommender systems. We present empirical results in the movie and shopping domains showing that unified Boltzmann machines can be used to combine content and collaborative information to yield results that are competitive with collaborative techniques in recommending items that have been seen before, and also effective at recommending cold-start items.},

 abstract = {Utility or preference elicitation is a critical component in many recommender and decision support systems. However, most frameworks for elicitation assume a predefined set of features (e.g., as derived from catalog descriptions) over which user preferences are expressed. Just as user preferences vary considerably, so too can the features over which they are most comfortable expressing these preferences. In this work, we consider preference elicitation in the presence of subjective or user-defined features. We treat the problem of learning a user's feature definition as one of concept learning, but whose goal is to learn only enough about the concept definition to enable a good decision to be made. This is complicated by the fact that user preferences are unknown. We describe computational procedures for identifying optimal alternatives w.r.t minimax regret in the presence of both utility and concept uncertainty; and develop several heuristic query strategies that focus on reduction of relevant concept and utility uncertainty. Computational experiments verify the efficacy of these strategies.},

Combining ideas and techniques from information filtering, user modeling, artificial intelligence, user interface design and human-computer interaction, recommender systems provide users with proactive suggestions that are tailored to meet their particular information needs and preferences. Indeed recommender systems have enjoyed considerable commercial success and continue to play an increasingly important role in many online services, from Amazon and Yahoo! to iTunes and Last.fm. It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Second ACM International Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), which builds on a wonderful legacy of research workshops, the Recommenders Summer School held in Bilbao in 2006, and the First ACM International Conference on Recommender Systems held in Minneapolis in 2007. This conference brings together leaders in the field, from both research and practice, to explore the latest innovations, challenges, and opportunities for recommender systems technologies. The call for papers attracted 121 submissions, a more than 100% increase compared to 2007, with authors from nearly 30 different countries. After a detailed scientific review process the program committee selected 38 papers for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, a 31% acceptance rate. Of these 38 papers, 20 full-length papers were accepted for oral presentation and 18 papers for poster presentation, of which 15 were full-length papers and 3 were short-papers. In addition, the conference program includes a keynote presentation by Yahoo!'s Andrei Broder; two panel sessions filled with industry leaders sharing experiences and raising challenges for the research community; and presentations of six early-stage recommender start-ups, each bidding to win a $100,000 prize from Strands, Inc. The conference also includes three tutorials, in which leaders of the field explore hot topics in more detail; and a doctoral symposium to provide an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished research faculty.},

The side-by-side comparison also reveals that users significantly favor the personality-based recommender and have a significantly higher intention to use such a system again. Therefore, we believe that if users accepted rating-based recommenders, they are most likely to accept personality-based recommenders and personality-based recommenders have a high likelihood to be widely adopted despite the fact that rating-based recommenders are now the industry norm.

For an e-commerce website, adopting the correct tools can affect its survival: effective product recommender tools are increasingly recognized by online stores as effective means to sell more products; on the other hand, sites that do not employ intelligent tools will not only see poor purchase volumes but also experience less traffic because consumers are more likely to return to a site employing recommender systems. This paper presents ongoing research in understanding the impact of various decision aids on users' interaction behaviors and their subjective perceptions of these aids. In the current experiment, we employed an eye tracker in an in-depth user study to understand the influence of recommenders on how users select items for the basket set. We collected more than 20,300 fixation data points in 3,648 areas of interest. Our studies show that while users still rely on product filtering tools, the use of recommenders is becoming more prominent in helping them construct the basket set and is monotonically increasing as time goes on.},

Then, the algorithm is applied to simultaneously rank actors, assets and group activities taking into account the target user and his/her context.

 abstract = {We welcome you to the 4th ACM Recommender Systems Conference (ACM RecSys 2010), this time from beautiful and sunny Barcelona. After three fantastic preceding conferences, we took on the challenge of continuing on the success trend knowing that a city such as Barcelona would offer the ideal setting. Not only is Barcelona a top tourism destination but it has also a very bustling industry that includes large companies and young startups in recommender systems and related areas. RecSys is maturing as a research area and you will find several signs of that maturity reflected in these proceedings. One sign is becoming cumulative: performance of new algorithms is compared to previous algorithms and contrasts are made between performance on different datasets. With maturity, however, also comes a questioning of assumptions. For example, you will find papers that argue for different measures of success than prediction accuracy, such as stability and coverage. Despite maturity, the field also continues to be creative. You will find papers exploring new ways of collecting user preferences beyond like/dislike of individual items, such as pairwise orderings or allocation of points among a set of items. You will also find research identifying and exploiting the specific characteristics of non-standard item types to recommend, ranging from people to groups to recipes to research papers. For the first time, ACM RecSys 2010 had more than 200 submissions. Of 129 full paper submissions, 25 were accepted (19.4%) for oral presentation at the conference. Of 78 short paper submissions, 32 were accepted (41.0%) for poster presentation. In addition, we introduced a new track for submission of demos and case study reports, which will also be presented at the poster session. The program also includes three invited tutorials, by senior researchers Joe Konstan, Ricardo Baeza-Yates, and Guy Shani, and an invited keynote by Edouard Servan-Schreiber. The conference begins with an industry panel examining the future of recommender systems in several different industries, and how it relates to search. Panelists from Neo Metrics Barcelona, Bloomberg.com, YouTube, SAP, and Avail Intelligence will join industry chairs Ido Guy and Alex Jaimes on stage. Tuesday morning begins with a panel on contests and challenges. In addition to a skeptic's voice questioning the wisdom of contests overall, the panel will explore alternative tasks for contests besides prediction and ranking, such as making creative use of the outputs of a fixed recommender engine, or eliciting inputs for a recommender engine. In addition to the main program, we would also like to highlight the growing success of the collocated workshops. This year we have seven workshops distributed on two different days of the conference. These workshops include most of the new trending research lines in recommender systems. They focus on application areas of RecSys such as music, e-Learning, or the social web. Others analyze some cross-cutting concerns in research such as how to deal with contextual or heterogeneous information, or how to bring the user into the loop in the evaluation phase. Finally, one workshop specifically focuses on the practical concerns of deploying and evaluating recommender systems in real-world settings.},

 abstract = {Robustness analysis research has shown that conventional memory-based recommender systems are very susceptible to malicious profile-injection attacks. A number of attack models have been proposed and studied and recent work has suggested that model-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms have greater robustness against these attacks. Moreover, to combat such attacks, several attack detection algorithms have been proposed. One that has shown high detection accuracy is based on using principal component analysis (PCA) to cluster attack profiles on the basis that such profiles are highly correlated. In this paper, we argue that the robustness observed in model-based algorithms is due to the fact that the proposed attacks have not targeted the specific vulnerabilities of these algorithms. We discuss how an effective attack targeting model-based algorithms that employ profile clustering can be designed. It transpires that the attack profiles employed in this attack, exhibit low rather than high pair-wise similarities and can easily be obfuscated to avoid PCA-based detection, while remaining effective.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems provide consumers with ratings of items. These ratings are based on a set of ratings that were obtained from a wide scope of users. Predicting the ratings can be formulated as a regression problem. Ensemble regression methods are effective tools that improve the results of simple regression algorithms by iteratively applying the simple algorithm to a diverse set of inputs. The present paper describes a simple and effective ensemble regressor for the prediction of missing ratings in recommender systems. The ensemble method is an adaptation of the AdaBoost regression algorithm for recommendation tasks. In all iterations, interpolation weights for all nearest neighbors are simultaneously derived by minimizing the root mean squared error. From iteration to iteration instances that are hard to predict are reinforced by manipulating their weights in the goal function that needs to be minimized. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the ensemble methodology significantly improves the predictive performance of single neighborhood-based collaborative filtering.},

Typically, code recommender tools have been based on rather simple rule based systems while many of the recent advances in Recommender Systems and Collaborative Filtering have been largely focused on rating data. While many of these advances can be incorporated in the code recommendation setting this problem also brings considerable challenges of its own. In this paper, we extend state-of-the-art collaborative filtering technology, namely Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) to this interesting application domain and show how to deal with the challenges posed by this problem. To this end, we introduce two new loss functions to the MMMF model. While we focus on code recommendation in this paper, our contributions and the methodology we propose can be of use in almost any collaborative setting that can be represented as a binary interaction matrix. We evaluate the algorithm on real data drawn from the Eclipse Open Source Project. The results show a significant improvement over current rule-based approaches.},

@inproceedings{Baltrunas:2009:CSI:1639714.1639759,
 abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations are computed by leveraging a historical data set of users' ratings for items. It assumes that the users' previously recorded ratings can help in predicting future ratings. This has been validated extensively, but in some domains item ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions, such as the time or the goal of the item consumption. This type of information is not exploited by standard CF models. This paper introduces and analyzes a novel pre-filtering technique for context-aware CF called item splitting. In this approach, the ratings of certain items are split, according to the value of an item-dependent contextual condition. Each split item generates two fictitious items that are used in the prediction algorithm instead of the original one. We evaluated this approach on real world and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix-factorization and nearest neighbor CF algorithms. We show that item splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the item selection method and on the influence of the contextual variables on the item ratings.},

Recommendations are made using our Eigentaste 2.0 constant-time collaborative filtering algorithm in combination with a new method for generating a weighted portfolio of recommendations. The key challenge is to generate a customized portfolio that does not necessarily exclude items already rated by the user. Under our method, the weights for items in the portfolio that have not yet been rated by the user are normalized factors of their predicted ratings, and the weights for items previously rated by the user are normalized factors of the actual ratings. Donation Dashboard 1.0 launched in April 2008, and as of May 8 2009 we have collected over 59,000 ratings of 70 nonprofit organizations from over 3,800 users. In this working paper we describe our experience developing Donation Dashboard, including the design of the system and our new method for portfolio generation. We use Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) to measure the accuracy of Eigentaste using our dataset of non-profit organization ratings and we compare that with the global mean algorithm.

The first is similarity concentration and the second is the appearance of hubs (i.e. points which appear in $k$-NN lists of many other points). Through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation we show that these phenomena are inherent properties of high-dimensional space, unrelated to other data properties like sparsity, and that they can impact CF algorithms by questioning the meaning and representativeness of discovered NNs. Moreover, we show that it is not easy to mitigate the phenomena using dimensionality reduction. Studying these phenomena aims to provide a better understanding of the limitations of memory-based CF and motivate the development of new algorithms that would overcome them.},

Compared to other types of recommenders, they require relatively little user effort, especially initially, despite potential accuracy problems. On the other hand, they rely on a set of critiques to elicit users feedback in order to improve accuracy. Thus the better the critiques are, the more accurately and efficiently the system becomes in generating its recommendations. This method has been successfully applied to high-involvement products. However, it was never tested on public taste products such as music, films, perfumes, fashion goods or wine. Indeed our initial trial adapting traditional critiquing methods to this new domain led to unsatisfactory results. This has motivated us to develop a novel approach named "editorial picked critiques" (EPC) that accounts for users' needs for popularity information, editorial suggestions, as well as their needs for personalization and diversity. Through an empirical study, we demonstrate that EPC presents a viable recommender approach and is superior on several dimensions to critiques generated by data mining methods.},

@inproceedings{Amatriain:2009:RAI:1639714.1639744,
 abstract = {A common approach to designing Recommender Systems (RS) consists of asking users to explicitly rate items in order to collect feedback about their preferences. However, users have been shown to be inconsistent and to introduce a non-negligible amount of natural noise in their ratings that affects the accuracy of the predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve RS accuracy by reducing the natural noise in the input data via a preprocessing step. In order to quantitatively understand the impact of natural noise, we first analyze the response of common recommendation algorithms to this noise. Next, we propose a novel algorithm to denoise existing datasets by means of re-rating: i.e. by asking users to rate previously rated items again. This denoising step yields very significant accuracy improvements. However, re-rating all items in the original dataset is unpractical. Therefore, we study the accuracy gains obtained when re-rating only some of the ratings.In particular, we propose two partial denoising strategies: data and user-dependent denoising. Finally, we compare the value of adding a rating of an unseen item vs. re-rating an item. We conclude with a proposal for RS to improve the quality of their user data and hence their accuracy: asking users to re-rate items might, in some circumstances, be more beneficial than asking users to rate unseen items.},

 abstract = {Previous work on using external aggregate rating information showed that this information can be incorporated in several different types of recommender systems and improves their performance. In this paper, we propose a more general class of methods that combine external aggregate information with individual ratings in a novel way. Unlike the previously proposed methods, one of the defining features of this approach is that it takes into the consideration not only the aggregate average ratings but also the variance of the aggregate distribution of ratings. The methods proposed in this paper estimate unknown ratings by finding an optimal linear combination of individual-level and aggregate-level rating estimators in a form of a hierarchical regression (HR) model that is grounded in the theory of statistics and machine learning. The proposed HR model is general enough so that the standard individual-level recommender systems and naive aggregate methods constitute special cases of this model. We show that for the general HR model, the presence of the aggregate variance, surprisingly, does not significantly improve estimation of unknown ratings vis-a-vis the case when only aggregate average ratings are considered. In the paper, we experimentally show that the optimal linear combination approach significantly dominates all other special cases, including the classical non-aggregated case and our previously studied aggregate methods, and therefore is the method of choice.},

It is personalised and dynamic, and allows to compute the indirect trust between two agents which are not neighbours based on the direct trust between agents that are neighbours. In analogy to some personalised versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of feedback centrality and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust metrics. In particular, it does not neglect cycles and other patterns characterising social networks, as some other algorithms do. In order to apply the metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over time.

We are very happy to welcome you to the Third ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (ACM RecSys 2009) in New York. In the last few years, ACM RecSys has continuously grown and meanwhile certainly can be understood as the scientific core event in the area of recommender systems, bringing together persons from academic research, industry research as well as from applications. While recommender systems has close relations to many neighboring fields such as machine learning, information retrieval, databases, human computer interaction, e-commerce, semantic web and many others and many of the best conferences in these areas have their dedicated sessions on recommender systems, ACM RecSys is the conference where all of them finally meet. With 187 submissions this year's ACM RecSys has continued to grow at a fast rate of over 50%. Authors from 35 different countries from all over the world submitted their papers. After the program committee consisting of 78 researchers finished a thorough scientific review process in two rounds writing almost 700 reviews, less than 19% of the long submissions have been accepted, the overall acceptance rate for long and short papers is less than 40%. Besides a deepened interest in algorithms for recommender systems, this year tags and social networks, privacy and security and trust attracted the most attention by authors. Moreover, the program of ACM RecSys 2009 includes two keynotes, one from a more academic perspective and another one from a more industrial perspective, a panel session about the recently concluded Netflix challenge, three tutorials and three workshops as well as a doctoral symposium.},

These attacks consist of the insertion of bogus user profiles into the system database in order to manipulate the recommendation output, for example to promote or demote the predicted ratings for a particular product. A number of attack models have been proposed and some detection strategies to identify these attacks have been empirically evaluated. In this paper we show that the standard attack models can be readily detected using statistical detection techniques. We argue that insufficient consideration of the effectiveness of attacks under a constraint of statistical invariance has been taken in past research. In fact, it is possible to create effective attacks that are undetectable using the detection strategies proposed to date, including the PCA-based clustering strategy which has shown excellent performance against standard attacks. Nevertheless, these more advanced attacks can also be detected with careful design of a statistical detector. The question posed for future research is whether attack models that produce effective attack profiles that are statistically identical to genuine profiles are really possible.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, people have been increasingly interested in exploiting Web Search Engines (WSEs) not only for having access to simple Web pages, but mainly for accomplishing even complex activities, namely Web-mediated processes (or taskflows). Thus, users' information needs will become more complex, and Web search and recommender systems should change accordingly for dealing with this shift. We claim that such taskflows and their composing tasks are implicitly present in users' minds when they interact with a WSE to access the Web. Our first research challenge is thus to evaluate this belief by analyzing a very large, long-term log of queries submitted to a WSE, and associating meaningful semantic labels with the extracted tasks (i.e., clusters of related queries) and taskflows. This large knowledge base constitutes a good starting point for building a model of users' behaviors. The second research challenge is to devise a novel recommender system that goes beyond the simple query suggestion of modern WSEs. Our system has to exploit the knowledge base of Web-mediated processes and the learned model of users' behaviors, to generate complex insights and task-based suggestions to incoming users while they interact with a WSE.},

Most collaborative tagging applications permit unsupervised tagging resulting in tag ambiguity in which a single tag has many different meanings and tag redundancy in which several tags have the same meaning. Common metrics for evaluating tag recommenders may overestimate the utility of ambiguous tags or ignore the appropriateness of redundant tags. Ambiguity and redundancy may even burden the user with additional effort by requiring them to clarify an annotation or forcing them to distinguish between highly related items. In this paper we demonstrate that ambiguity and redundancy impede the evaluation and performance of tag recommenders. Five tag recommendation strategies based on popularity, collaborative filtering and link analysis are explored. We use a cluster-based approach to define ambiguity and redundancy and provide extensive evaluation on three real world datasets.},

@inproceedings{Lu:2009:SAC:1639714.1639719,
 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal model for collaborative filtering applications. Our model is based on low-rank matrix factorization that uses a spatio-temporal filtering approach to estimate user and item factors. The spatial component regularizes the factors by exploiting correlation across users and/or items, modeled as a function of some implicit feedback (e.g., who rated what) and/or some side information (e.g., user demographics, browsing history). In particular, we incorporate correlation in factors through a Markov random field prior in a probabilistic framework, whereby the neighborhood weights are functions of user and item covariates. The temporal component ensures that the user/item factors adapt to process changes that occur through time and is implemented in a state space framework with fast estimation through Kalman filtering. Our spatio-temporal filtering (ST-KF hereafter) approach provides a single joint model to simultaneously incorporate both spatial and temporal structure in ratings and therefore provides an accurate method to predict future ratings. To ensure scalability of ST-KF, we employ a mean-field approximation for inference. Incorporating user/item covariates in estimating neighborhood weights also helps in dealing with both cold-start and warm-start problems seamlessly in a single unified modeling framework; covariates predict factors for new users and items through the neighborhood. We illustrate our method on simulated data, benchmark data and data obtained from a relatively new recommender system application arising in the context of Yahoo! Front Page.},

The input features of the level-2 predictor are predictions from component engines and the runtime metrics.

We investigate a new decision criterion, setwise minimax regret (SMR), for constructing optimal recommendation sets: we develop algorithms for computing SMR, and prove that SMR determines choice sets for queries that are myopically optimal. This provides a natural basis for generating compound critiques in conversational recommender systems. Our simulation results suggest that this utility-theoretically sound approach to user modeling allows much more effective navigation of a product space than traditional approaches based on, for example, heuristic utility models and product similarity measures.},

 abstract = {The recommendation of queries, known as query suggestion, is a common practice on major Web Search Engines. It aims to help users to find the information they are looking for, and is usually based on the knowledge learned from past interactions with the search engine. In this paper we propose a new model for query suggestion, the Search Shortcut Problem, that consists in recommending "successful" queries that allowed other users to satisfy, in the past, similar information needs. This new model has several advantages with respect to traditional query suggestion approaches. First, it allows a straightforward evaluation of algorithms from available query log data. Moreover, it simplifies the application of several recommendation techniques from other domains. Particularly, in this work we applied Collaborative Filtering to this problem, and evaluated the interesting results achieved on large query logs from AOL and Microsoft. Different techniques for analyzing and extracting information from query logs, as well as new metrics and techniques for measuring the effectiveness of recommendations are proposed and evaluated. The results obtained clearly show the importance of several of our contributions, and open an interesting field for future research.},

 abstract = {With the advent of online social networks, the trust-based approach to recommendation has emerged which exploits the trust network among users and makes recommendations based on the ratings of trusted users in the network. In this paper, we introduce a two dimensional trust model which dynamically gets updated based on users's feedbacks, in contrast to static trust values in current trust models. Explorability measures the extent to which a user can rely on recommendations returned by the social network of a trusted user. Dependability represents the extent to which a user's own ratings can be trusted by users trusting him directly and indirectly. We propose a method to learn the values of explorability and dependability from raw trust data and feedback expressed by users on the recommendations they receive. Positive feedback will increase the trust and negative feedback will decrease the trust among users. We performed an evaluation on the Epinions dataset, demonstrating that exploiting user feedback results in lower prediction error compared to existing trust-based and collaborative filtering approaches.},

 abstract = {Short search engine queries do not provide contextual information, making it difficult for traditional search engines to understand what users are really requesting. One approach to this problem is to use recommender systems that identify user interests through various methods in order to provide information specific to the user's needs. However, many current recommender systems use a collaborative model based on a network of users to provide the recommendations, leading to problems in environments where network relationships are sparse or unknown. Content-based recommenders can avoid the sparsity problem but they may be inefficient for large document collections. In this paper, we propose a concept-based recommender system that recommends papers to general users of the CiteSeerx digital library of Computer Science research publications. We also represent a novel way of classifying documents and creating user profiles based on the ACM (Association for Computer Machinery) classification tree. Based on these user profiles which are built using past click histories, relevant papers in the domain are recommended to users. Experiments with a set of users on the CiteSeerX database show that our concept-based method provides accurate recommendations even with limited user profile histories.},

Having this access, however, undermines the users' privacy. The more information is revealed to the server on the user-item relations, the lower the users' privacy is. Yet, hiding part of the profiles to increase the privacy comes at the cost of recommendation accuracy or difficulty of implementing the method. In this paper, we propose a distributed mechanism for users to augment their profiles in a way that obfuscates the user-item connection to an untrusted server, with minimum loss on the accuracy of the recommender system. We rely on the central server to generate the recommendations. However, each user stores his profile offline, modifies it by partly merging it with the profile of similar users through direct contact with them, and only then periodically uploads his profile to the server. We propose a metric to measure privacy at the system level, using graph matching concepts. Applying our method to the Netflix prize dataset, we show the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving the tradeoff between privacy and accuracy in recommender systems in an applicable way.},

Specifically, we hypothesize that users with different levels of domain knowledge prefer different types of PE. While domain experts reported higher satisfaction and perceived usefulness with attribute-based PE (i.e., indicating preference levels for the domain-related attributes), novices preferred case-based PE (i.e., indicating the preference for specific examples, from which attribute-preferences can then be implicitly calculated). The paper discusses the decision-theoretical principles that are believed to lead to this distinction, as well as an experiment that provides substantial evidence for the hypothesis. Consequently, we introduce the idea of adapting the method of PE to users' domain knowledge on the fly using click stream data.},

 abstract = {Content-based recommender systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past. The basic process consists of matching up the attributes of a user profile, in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item). Common-sense and domain-specific knowledge may be useful to give some meaning to the content of items, thus helping to generate more informative features than "plain" attributes. The process of learning user profiles could also benefit from the infusion of exogenous knowledge or open source knowledge, with respect to the classical use of endogenous knowledge (extracted from the items themselves). The main contribution of this paper is a proposal for knowledge infusion into content-based recommender systems, which suggests a novel view of this type of systems, mostly oriented to content interpretation by way of the infused knowledge. The idea is to provide the system with the "linguistic" and "cultural" background knowledge that hopefully allows a more accurate content analysis than classic approaches based on words. A set of knowledge sources is modeled to create a memory of linguistic competencies and of more specific world "facts", that can be exploited to reason about content as well as to support the user profiling and recommendation processes. The modeled knowledge sources include a dictionary, Wikipedia, and content generated by users (i.e. tags provided on items), while the core of the reasoning component is a spreading activation algorithm.},

 abstract = {Different buyers exhibit different purchasing behaviors. Some rush to purchase new products while others tend to be more cautious, waiting for reviews from people they trust. In market analysis, the former group of buyers is often referred to as innovators and early adopters while the latter group is referred to as laggards. The adoption behavior is a dynamic feature of the user and varies over groups of products, e.g., innovators of literature may not be the innovators of electronics. The adoption order of users is a dynamic feature of the product, which can help to predict the future potential buyers. However, such dynamic features are usually unavailable in the description of products. In this paper, we study the user behavior of an online review website- Epinions.com. We first propose to model user adoption behaviors by creating a total ordering among users who rate the products in a given category. We develop a greedy algorithm and a Markov-chain based algorithm for computing the category total ordering. Next, we show that by using user behavior information, we can more accurately predict the category of a new product as well as predict which users will follow. Furthermore, by using the Epinion.com trust network as evidence, we demonstrate that our total ordering can group users into communities that closely resemble the trust network. Thus the adoption order can be a useful feature in recommendation systems.},

A key challenge for recommender systems is providing high quality recommendation to users in ``cold-start" situations. We consider three types of cold-start problems: 1) recommendation on existing items for new users; 2) recommendation on new items for existing users; 3) recommendation on new items for new users. We propose predictive feature-based regression models that leverage all available information of users and items, such as user demographic information and item content features, to tackle cold-start problems. The resulting algorithms scale efficiently as a linear function of the number of observations. We verify the usefulness of our approach in three cold-start settings on the MovieLens and EachMovie datasets, by comparing with five alternatives including random, most popular, segmented most popular, and two variations of Vibes affinity algorithm widely used at Yahoo! for recommendation.},
