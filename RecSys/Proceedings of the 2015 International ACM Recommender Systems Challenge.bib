For some of the sessions, there are also buying events. The target of this task is to predict whether a user is going to buy something or not in a session, and if the user is buying, which products (items) the user is going to buy. In our approach, we treat the task as a classification problem and use linear and non-linear models to make the predictions, and then build an ensemble system based on the output of the individual systems. The evaluation results show that our final system is effective on the test data.},

 abstract = {In this paper, the task is to determine whether an HTTP session buys an item, or not, and if so, which items will be purchased. An HTTP session is a series of item clicks. A session has type buy, if it buys at least one item, or non-buy otherwise. Accordingly, data is in (session, item, time) format, which tells us when an item is clicked or purchased during an HTTP session. The main challenge comes from the fact that (1) user information is not available for clicked or purchased items, which are merely tagged with anonymous sessions, and (2) suggestions are highly temporal as they are suggested to sessions instead of users. In other words, users which are stable and identified are replaced with sessions which are temporal and anonymous. In this work, we propose a feature-based system that predicts the type of a session, and determines which items are going to be purchased. As the main contribution, we have modeled sessions separated by the number of unique items, prioritized item-features based on the number of clicks, and utilized cumulative statistics of similar items to attenuate the sparsity problem.},

In order to efficiently solve these problems, we propose (1) Comprehensive Feature Engineering method (CFE) including imputation of missing values to make up for insufficiency of information and (2) Decision Boundary Focused Under-Sampling method (DBFUS) to cope with class imbalance problem and to reduce learning time and memory usage.

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2014) held between October 6th and 10th in Foster City, Silicon Valley, U.S.A. The annual RecSys conference is the premier international forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their challenges, research results, and experiences in the broad field of recommender systems. RecSys 2014 features keynote talks, research paper presentations, industry sessions, poster sessions, workshops, tutorials, demonstrations, a doctoral symposium, and the RecSys Challenge. The success of a conference largely depends on the quality of the submitted works. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all the authors for submitting their original research to Recsys 2014. The RecSys conference has seen remarkable growth since its inception as Recommenders 06 Summer School on the Present and Future of Recommender Systems. It has evolved into a full-fledged, top research conference since 2007, underscoring the increasing role and significant challenges related to recommender systems. This year we received a record number of 234 submissions and accepted 35 long papers for oral presentation (acceptance rate 23%) and 20 short papers for poster presentation (acceptance rate 24%). The RecSys conference is driven by real-world challenges. The key topics covered in this year's research program include ranking and top-n recommendations (7.5% of papers), matrix factorization (5.6%), cold start (5.6%), implicit feedback (4.3%), context awareness (3.6%), metrics and evaluation (3.5%), novel applications (2.9%), and more. The quality of a conference program also depends on the competence and hard work of its devoted volunteers. To select the 55 accepted papers out of the initial 234 submissions, this year, we implemented a two-tier review process, where each paper received detailed reviews from three program committee members, followed by a meta-review by a senior program committee member. Our entire committee involved 20 senior and 102 regular Program Committee members. We are extremely grateful to all the PC members for volunteering their time to generate more than 900 detailed and insightful reviews and discussions. In addition to the technical paper program, the program provides a diverse array of exciting venues for our attendees to interact with top experts from academia and industry on topics related to recommender systems. We are very fortunate to have three world-class keynote speakers this year spanning industry and academia, providing inspirational talks on cutting-edge challenges and directions in the field. We also feature an industry program capitalizing on being located in Silicon Valley's backyard. The invited industry speakers include renowned executives from top Silicon Valley companies, and representatives of new age companies using Recommender Systems in unique and disruptive ways. In addition, this year's program will host an industry panel discussing the topic of using smart systems monitoring and guiding our socio-digital experience. Our poster and demonstration event showcases numerous posters and nine live system demonstrations. Before and after the main conference, four tutorials and nine workshops will be held, including the RecSys Challenge. In addition, nine students were selected and invited to participate in the doctoral symposium of the conference.},

This challenge was based on a large scale dataset of over 9.2 million user-item click sessions from an online e-commerce retailer. The goal was to use this data to predict which items (if any) were bought in the 2.3 million test sessions. Our solution to this problem was two-staged, we first predicted if a given session contained a buy event and then predicted which items were bought. Both stages were fully automated and used classifiers trained on large sets of extracted features. The prediction rules were further optimized to the target objective using a greedy procedure developed specifically for this problem. Our best submission, which was a blend of several different models, achieved a score of 60,265 and placed 4'th out of 567 teams. All approaches presented in this work are general and can be applied to any problem of this type.},

The RecSys conference series has clearly established itself as the premier international forum for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry meet to share their challenges, solutions, research results, and experiences in the field. The maturity of the conference is clearly demonstrated by the high quality of the submitted research work. This year RecSys received again clearly more than 200 submissions (131 long papers and 84 short papers) and the review process was extremely selective. The Program Committee worked very hard to ensure that every paper got at least three careful and fair reviews and one metareview. All papers, particularly those at the borderline, were also reviewed and thoroughly discussed by a Senior Program Committee member and by the PC Chairs. This process finally led to the acceptance of 28 long papers for oral presentation (acceptance rate 21.4%) and 22 short papers for poster presentation (acceptance rate 26.2%). We are therefore extremely grateful to our 131 Program Committee members (34 senior and 97 regular) and to our 57 additional reviewers for producing more than 875 detailed and insightful reviews and metareviews. Furthermore, we would like to particularly thank those Senior Program Committee members, who assisted the program chairs in identifying those distinguished papers who received awards. Besides the technical paper program consisting of oral presentations and a poster and demo session, the core conference program also includes two keynote speakers, two industry sessions and a panel discussion. In order to accommodate the program in a two and a half day format technical papers are presented in two parallel tracks for the first time in this conference series. In addition the conference includes four tutorials and a challenge as a pre-conference program and nine workshops as well as a doctoral symposium as post-conference events.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we describe our approach to RecSys 2015 challenge problem. Given a dataset of item click sessions, the problem is to predict whether a session results in a purchase and which items are purchased if the answer is yes. We define a simpler analogous problem where given an item and its session, we try to predict the probability of purchase for the given item. For each session, the predictions result in a set of purchased items or often an empty set. We apply monthly time windows over the dataset. For each item in a session, we engineer features regarding the session, the item properties, and the time window. Then, a balanced random forest classifier is trained to perform predictions on the test set. The dataset is particularly challenging due to privacy-preserving definition of a session, the class imbalance problem, and the volume of data. We report our findings with respect to feature engineering, the choice of sampling schemes, and classifier ensembles. Experimental results together with benefits and shortcomings of the proposed approach are discussed. The solution is efficient and practical in commodity computers.},
