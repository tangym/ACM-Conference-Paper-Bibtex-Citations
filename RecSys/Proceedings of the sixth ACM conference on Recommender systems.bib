 abstract = {Online hotel searching is a daunting task due to the wealth of online information. Reviews written by other travelers replace the word-of-mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation. Thus, a cold start recommender system is needed. In this work we design a cold start hotel recommender system, which uses the text of the reviews as its main data. We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. Our algorithm imitates a user that favors reviews written with the same trip intent and from people of similar background (nationality) and with similar preferences for hotel aspects, which are our defined context groups. Our approach combines numerous elements, including unsupervised clustering to build a vocabulary for hotel aspects, semantic analysis to understand sentiment towards hotel features, and the profiling of intent and nationality groups. We implemented our system which was used by the public to conduct 150 trip planning experiments. We compare our solution to the top suggestions of the mentioned web services and show that users were, on average, 20% more satisfied with our hotel recommendations. We outperform these web services even more in cities where hotel prices are high.},

People generate and consume data in real-time within social networking services, such as Twitter, and increasingly rely upon continuous streams of messages for real-time access to fresh knowledge about current affairs. In this paper, we focus on analyzing social streams in real-time for personalized topic recommendation and discovery. We consider collaborative filtering as an online ranking problem and present Stream Ranking Matrix Factorization - RMFX -, which uses a pairwise approach to matrix factorization in order to optimize the personalized ranking of topics. Our novel approach follows a selective sampling strategy to perform online model updates based on active learning principles, that closely simulates the task of identifying relevant items from a pool of mostly uninteresting ones. RMFX is particularly suitable for large scale applications and experiments on the "476 million Twitter tweets" dataset show that our online approach largely outperforms recommendations based on Twitter's global trend, and it is also able to deliver highly competitive Top-N recommendations faster while using less space than Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF), a state-of-the-art matrix factorization technique for Collaborative Filtering, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.},

Few approaches for recommending tags to a user for a document address this new item problem, concentrating instead on artificially created post-core datasets where it is guaranteed that the user as well as the document of each test post is known to the system and already has some tags assigned to it. In order to recommend tags for unseen documents, approaches are required which model documents not only based on the tags assigned to it in the past (if any), but also the content. The focus of my research is on utilising the content of documents in order to address the new item problem in tag recommendation. I apply this methodology first to simple baseline tag recommenders and then the more advanced tag recommendation algorithm FolkRank. One of my main contributions is a novel adaptation to the FolkRank graph model to use multiple word nodes instead of a single document node to represent each document. This enables FolkRank to recommend tags for unseen documents and makes it applicable to full real-world tagging datasets, addressing the new item problem in tag recommendation.},

Thousands of people share or distribute their music collections on the Internet, resulting in an explosive increase of information and more user dependence on automatic recommender systems. Though there are many techniques such as collaborative filtering, most approaches focus mainly on users' global behaviors, neglecting local actions and the specific properties of music. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective local implicit feedback model mining users' local preferences to get better recommendation performance in both rating and ranking prediction. Moreover, we design an efficient training algorithm to speed up the updating procedure, and give a method to find the most appropriate time granularity to assist the performance. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of this model, which show that it outperforms baseline model significantly. Integration with existing temporal models achieves a great improvement compared to the reported best single model for Yahoo! Music.},

 abstract = {Traditional recommender systems are well established in scenarios in which "enough"items, users and ratings are available for the algorithms to operate on. However, automatic recommendations are also desirable in smaller online communities which only contain several hundred items and users. Collaborative filters, as one of the most successful technologies for recommender systems, do not perform well here. This paper argues that recommender systems can make use of contextual information and domain specific semantics in order to be able to generate recommendations also for these smaller usage scenarios. The new hybrid recommendation approach presented in the paper enhances traditional neighborhood-based collaborative filtering techniques through the use of new kinds of data and a combination of different recommendation methods (rule, demographic, and average based). While the algorithmic techniques presented in this paper are suitable (especially) for smaller online communities, they can also be applied to improve the quality of recommendations in larger communities. The approach was implemented and evaluated in a small regional bound parent education community. A multi-staged evaluation was conducted in order to determine the quality of recommendations: A cross-validation (recall), an expert questionnaire (recommendation quality) and a field study (user satisfaction). The results show that recommenders even for smaller communities are possible and can produce high quality recommendations.},

We exploit the implicit feedback derived from the user's listening behavior, and we model channel recommendation as a sequential decision making problem. We have implemented a personal RS that integrates reinforcement learning techniques to decide what channel to play every time the user asks for a new music track or the current track finishes playing. In a live user study we show that the proposed system can sequentially select the next channel to play such that the users listen to the streamed tracks for a larger fraction, and for more time, compared to a baseline system not exploiting implicit feedback.},

 abstract = {In the Recommendation Problem, it is often important to find a set of items similar to a particular item or a group of items. This problem of finding similar items for the recommendation task may also be viewed as a link prediction problem in a network, where the items can be treated as the nodes. The strength of the edge connecting two items represents the similarity between the items. In this context, a central challenge is to suitably define an appropriate dissimilarity function between the items. For content based recommender systems, the dissimilarity function should take into account the individual attributes of the items. The same attribute may have different importances in different parts of the underlying network. We focus on the problem of learning a suitable dissimilarity function between items and address it by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem which captures the local weightages of the attributes in different regions of the graph. The constraints are imposed in such a way that the non-connected nodes show higher value of dissimilarity than the connected nodes. The local tuning of the weights learns the optimal value of weights in various parts of the network: from the portions having rich graph information to the portions having only content information. Detailed experimentation shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the Adamic Adar metric as well as logistic regression methodology.},

In that context, several authors have proposed to consider missing ratings as some form of negative feedback to compensate for the skewed distribution of observed ratings when users choose the items they rate. In this work, we study two major biases of the selection of items: the first one is that some items obtain more ratings than others (popularity effect), and the second one is that positive ratings are observed more frequently than negative ratings (positivity effect). We present a theoretical analysis and experiments on the Yahoo! dataset with randomly selected items, which show that considering missing data as a form of negative feedback during training may improve performances, but also that it can be misleading when testing, favoring models of popularity more than models of user preferences.},

 abstract = {Online hotel searching is a daunting task due to the wealth of online information. Reviews written by other travelers replace the word-of-mouth, yet turn the search into a time consuming task. Users do not rate enough hotels to enable a collaborative filtering based recommendation. Thus, a cold start recommender system is needed. This demo describes briefly our cold start hotel recommender system, which uses the text of the reviews as its main data. We define context groups based on reviews extracted from TripAdvisor.com and Venere.com. We introduce a novel weighted algorithm for text mining. We implemented our system which was used by the public to conduct 150 trip planning experiments. We compare our solution to the top suggestions of the mentioned web services and show that users were, on average, 20% more satisfied with our hotel recommendations. We outperform these web services even more in cities where hotel prices are high.},

 abstract = {Recommendation accuracy can be improved by incorporating trust relationships derived from social networks. Most recent work on social network based recommendation is focused on minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE). Social network based top-k recommendation, which recommends to a user a small number of items at a time, is not well studied. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on improving the accuracy of top-k recommendation using social networks. We first show that the existing social-trust enhanced Matrix Factorization (MF) models can be tailored for top-k recommendation by including observed and missing ratings in their training objective functions. We also propose a Nearest Neighbor (NN) based top-k recommendation method that combines users' neighborhoods in the trust network with their neighborhoods in the latent feature space. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that social networks can significantly improve the top-k hit ratio, especially for cold start users. Surprisingly, we also found that the technical approach for combining feedback data (e.g. ratings) with social network information that works best for minimizing RMSE works poorly for maximizing the hit ratio, and vice versa.},

In this paper, we present a recommender system for audio-visual content that generates suggestions for groups of people (such as families or friends) in the home environment. In this context, different group recommendation strategies are evaluated for various algorithms and sizes of the group. An offline evaluation proves the assumption that for randomly composed groups the accuracy of all recommendation algorithms decreases if the group size grows. Besides, the results show that the group recommendation strategy which produces the most accurate results is depending on the algorithm that is used for generating individual recommendations. Consequently, if an existing recommender system for individuals is extended to a recommender system for groups, the group recommendation strategy has to be chosen based on the utilized recommendation algorithm in order to maximize the efficiency of the group recommendations.},

@inproceedings{Rodriguez:2012:MOO:2365952.2365961,
 abstract = {We address the problem of optimizing recommender systems for multiple relevance objectives that are not necessarily aligned. Specifically, given a recommender system that optimizes for one aspect of relevance, semantic matching (as defined by any notion of similarity between source and target of recommendation; usually trained on CTR), we want to enhance the system with additional relevance signals that will increase the utility of the recommender system, but that may simultaneously sacrifice the quality of the semantic match. The issue is that semantic matching is only one relevance aspect of the utility function that drives the recommender system, albeit a significant aspect. In talent recommendation systems, job posters want candidates who are a good match to the job posted, but also prefer those candidates to be open to new opportunities. Recommender systems that recommend discussion groups must ensure that the groups are relevant to the users' interests, but also need to favor active groups over inactive ones. We refer to these additional relevance signals (job-seeking intent and group activity) as extraneous features, and they account for aspects of the utility function that are not captured by the semantic match (i.e. post-CTR down-stream utilities that reflect engagement: time spent reading, sharing, commenting, etc). We want to include these extraneous features into the recommendations, but we want to do so while satisfying the following requirements: 1) we do not want to drastically sacrifice the quality of the semantic match, and 2) we want to quantify exactly how the semantic match would be affected as we control the different aspects of the utility function. In this paper, we present an approach that satisfies these requirements. We frame our approach as a general constrained optimization problem and suggest ways in which it can be solved efficiently by drawing from recent research on optimizing non-smooth rank metrics for information retrieval. Our approach features the following characteristics: 1) it is model and feature agnostic, 2) it does not require additional labeled training data to be collected, and 3) it can be easily incorporated into an existing model as an additional stage in the computation pipeline. We validate our approach in a revenue-generating recommender system that ranks billions of candidate recommendations on a daily basis and show that a significant improvement in the utility of the recommender system can be achieved with an acceptable and predictable degradation in the semantic match quality of the recommendations.},

Over the last several years, ACM RecSys has become a flagship event in the area of recommender systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world have an opportunity to meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. This year, ACM RecSys had 169 submissions from 42 different countries that were sent out for review. As was the case in the last few years, there were two paper submission categories: long papers (that should report on substantial contributions of lasting value) and short papers (that typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper). Out of 110 long paper submissions, 22 were accepted (20.0%) for oral presentation at the conference. In addition, to accommodate the growing number of quality long paper submissions over the years, 8 additional long papers were accepted for poster presentation (resulting in the final acceptance rate of 27.3% for long paper submissions). Out of 59 short paper submissions, 24 were accepted (40.7%) for poster presentation at the conference. In addition to the paper presentations, the conference program includes a multitude of other interesting events. These events include: two keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Noshir Contractor (Northwestern University) and one from an industrial perspective by Neel Sundaresan (eBay Research Labs); a highly diverse industry track featuring Andrew Tomkins (Google), Rajat Raina (Facebook), Jon Sanders (Netflix), Pankaj Gupta (Twitter) and Eric Bieschke (Pandora); a record number of nine workshops; three invited tutorials; a doctoral symposium; and a panel on the latest emerging issues that are important to the field.},

Our experiments indicate that Social Referral is a promising mechanism for recommendation delivery. The experiments show that a significant portion of users are receptive to passing along relevant recommendations to their social networks, and that recommendations delivered through users' social networks are much more likely to be accepted than those directly delivered to users.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems help web users to address information overload. However their performance depends on the number of provided ratings by users. This problem is amplified for a new user because he/she has not provided any rating. To address this problem, active learning methods have been proposed to acquire those ratings from users, that will help most in determining their interests. However, different from the classic active learning, users (the "oracle") are not always able to provide an answer for queries. The easiest way to solve this problem is to ask most popular items, i.e items which have received many ratings from training users. But it is static and presents the same items to all users regardless of the ratings they have provided so far. In this paper we propose a method that improves the most popular selection strategy using the characteristics of matrix factorization. It finds similar users to the new user in the latent space and then selects item which is most popular among the similar users. The experimental results show the proposed method outperforms the most popular method both in terms of error and the number of received ratings.},

 abstract = {Social-networking sites have started to offer tools that suggest "guests" who should be invited to user-defined social events (e.g., birthday parties, networking events). The problem of how to recommend people to events is similar to the more traditional (recommender system) problem of how to recommend events (items) to people (users). Yet, upon Foursquare data of "who visits what" in the city of London, we show that a state-of-the-art recommender system does not perform well -mainly because of data sparsity. To fix this problem, we add domain knowledge to the recommendation process. From the complex system literature in human mobility, we learn two insights: 1) there are special individuals (often called power users) who visit many places; and 2) individuals go to a venue not only because they like it but also because they are close-by. We model these insights into two simple models and learn that: 1) simply recommending power users works better than random but is far from producing the best recommendations; 2) an item-based recommender system produces accurate recommendations; and 3) recommending places that are closest to a user's geographic center of interest produces recommendations that are as accurate as, if not more accurate than, item-based recommender's. This last result has practical implications as it offers guidelines for designing location-based recommender systems and for partly addressing cold-start situations.},

 abstract = {Contextual factors can greatly influence the users' preferences in listening to music. Although it is hard to capture these factors directly, it is possible to see their effects on the sequence of songs liked by the user in his/her current interaction with the system. In this paper, we present a context-aware music recommender system which infers contextual information based on the most recent sequence of songs liked by the user. Our approach mines the top frequent tags for songs from social tagging Web sites and uses topic modeling to determine a set of latent topics for each song, representing different contexts. Using a database of human-compiled playlists, each playlist is mapped into a sequence of topics and frequent sequential patterns are discovered among these topics. These patterns represent frequent sequences of transitions between the latent topics representing contexts. Given a sequence of songs in a user's current interaction, the discovered patterns are used to predict the next topic in the playlist. The predicted topics are then used to post-filter the initial ranking produced by a traditional recommendation algorithm. Our experimental evaluation suggests that our system can help produce better recommendations in comparison to a conventional recommender system based on collaborative or content-based filtering. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach proposed here is also useful in providing better insight into the underlying reasons for song selection and in applications such as playlist construction and context prediction.},

These recommendations provide a shortcut to reach the desired elements and increase the awareness of the developer in relation to elements that may be of interest in that moment.

This work develops a recommender system aiming to present users with items -- news stories, in our case -- on which they are likely to comment. We combine items' content with a collaborative-filtering approach (utilizing users' co-commenting patterns) in a latent factor modeling framework. Building upon previous work, we focus on a continuous, real-time approach to address the problem above. After an initial training period during which commenting activity of users is observed, the system is tested at each subsequent comment submission event by predicting which story is being commented on by a given user at a given time. Our results show that we are able to overcome the site's inherent presentation bias and outperform a strong baseline as users' commenting history grows.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 6th ACM Recommender Systems Conference (ACM RecSys 2012), held in Dublin, Ireland on September 9-13. As RecSys enters the second half of its first decade, it has clearly established itself as the premier international venue for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. The growing maturity of the conference is reflected through several changes in the program as compared to previous years: the tutorial program includes four exciting tutorials, which, for the first time, were not invited, but rather submitted and rigorously reviewed. We also put a special emphasis on soliciting demonstrations, leading to a record number of 10 demos accepted to the conference. In addition, this year continues the tradition of attractive collocated workshops, with a total of 8. Finally, 8 PhD students have been accepted to participate in the Doctoral Symposium. In parallel to growing and diversifying participation opportunities, the selectivity of the short paper track was substantially increased, while the competitive acceptance rate of the long paper track was maintained. Overall, the number of paper submissions went up almost 10% as compared to last year, with a total of 185 submissions. Out of 119 full paper submissions, 24 were accepted (20.2%) for oral presentation at the conference. Out of 66 short paper submissions, 21 were accepted (31.8%) for poster presentation at the conference. 5 of these 21 have been identified as industry short papers, highlighting the fact that their main contribution lies in the description of a real system, typically already in wide use. The conference program includes two keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Jure Leskovec (Stanford University) and one from an industrial perspective by Ron Kohavi (Microsoft). The Industry program also includes a rich set of talks by Ralf Herbrich (Facebook), Ronny Lempel (Yahoo! Research), Sumanth Kolar (StumbleUpon), Anmol Bhasin (LinkedIn), Thore Graepel (Microsoft Research), and Paul Lamere (The Echo Nest).},

Moreover, this noise limits the measurable predictive power of any recommender system. We propose an information theoretic framework for quantifying the preference information contained in ratings and predictions. We computationally explore the properties of our model and apply our framework to estimate the efficiency of different rating scales for real world datasets. We then estimate how the amount of information predictions give to users is related to the scale ratings are collected on. Our findings suggest a tradeoff in rating scale granularity: while previous research indicates that coarse scales (such as thumbs up / thumbs down) take less time, we find that ratings with these scales provide less predictive value to users. We introduce a new measure, preference bits per second, to quantitatively reconcile this tradeoff.},

 abstract = {Performing accurate suggestions is an objective of paramount importance for effective recommender systems. Other important and increasingly evident objectives are novelty and diversity, which are achieved by recommender systems that are able to suggest diversified items not easily discovered by the users. Different recommendation algorithms have particular strengths and weaknesses when it comes to each of these objectives, motivating the construction of hybrid approaches. However, most of these approaches only focus on optimizing accuracy, with no regard for novelty and diversity. The problem of combining recommendation algorithms grows significantly harder when multiple objectives are considered simultaneously. For instance, devising multi-objective recommender systems that suggest items that are simultaneously accurate, novel and diversified may lead to a conflicting-objective problem, where the attempt to improve an objective further may result in worsening other competing objectives. In this paper we propose a hybrid recommendation approach that combines existing algorithms which differ in their level of accuracy, novelty and diversity. We employ an evolutionary search for hybrids following the Strength Pareto approach, which isolates hybrids that are not dominated by others (i.e., the so called Pareto frontier). Experimental results on two recommendation scenarios show that: (i) we can combine recommendation algorithms in order to improve an objective without significantly hurting other objectives, and (ii) we allow for adjusting the compromise between accuracy, diversity and novelty, so that the recommendation emphasis can be adjusted dynamically according to the needs of different users.},

As a result, paper recommender systems have been proposed to help researchers find their interested papers. Most previous studies in paper recommendations mainly concentrate on paper-paper or user-paper similarities without taking users' reading purposes into account. It is common that different users may prefer to different aspects of a paper, e.g., the focused problem/task or the proposed solution. In this paper, we propose to satisfy user-specific reading purposes by recommending the most problem-related papers or solution-related papers to users separately. For a target paper, we use the paper citation graph to generate a set of potential relevant papers. Once getting the candidate set, we calculate the problem-based similarities and solution-based similarities between candidates and the target paper through a concept based topic model, respectively. We evaluate our models on a real academic paper dataset and our experiments show that our approach outperforms a traditional similarity based model and can provide highly relevant paper recommendations according to different reading purposes for researchers.},

 abstract = {In 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, a machine learning and data mining competition for movie rating prediction. We offered $1 million to whoever improved the accuracy of our existing system called Cinematch by 10%. We conducted this competition to find new ways to improve the recommendations we provide to our members, which is a key part of our business. However, we had to come up with a proxy question that was easier to evaluate and quantify: the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted rating. A year into the competition, the Korbell team won the first Progress Prize with an 8.43% improvement. They reported more than 2000 hours of work in order to come up with the final combination of 107 algorithms that gave them this prize. And, they gave us the source code. We looked at the two underlying algorithms with the best performance in the ensemble. To put these algorithms to use, we had to work to overcome some limitations, for instance that they were built to handle 100 million ratings, instead of the more than 5 billion that we have, and that they were not built to adapt as members added more ratings. But once we overcame those challenges, we put the two algorithms into production, where they are still used as part of our recommendation engine. You might be wondering what happened with the final Grand Prize ensemble that won the $1M two years later. This is a truly impressive compilation and culmination of years of work, blending hundreds of predictive models to finally cross the finish line. We evaluated some of the new methods offline but the additional accuracy gains that we measured did not seem to justify the engineering effort needed to bring them into a production environment. This example highlights the fact that, besides improving offline metrics such as the RMSE, recommender systems need to take into account other practical issues such as scalability or deployment. In this tutorial, we go over some of those practical issues that many times are as important as the theory, if not more, in order to build an industrial-scale real-world recommender system.},

 abstract = {Measuring the error in rating prediction has been by far the dominant evaluation methodology in the Recommender Systems literature. Yet there seems to be a general consensus that this criterion alone is far from being enough to assess the practical effectiveness of a recommender system. Information Retrieval metrics have started to be used to evaluate item selection and ranking rather than rating prediction, but considerable divergence remains in the adoption of such metrics by different authors. On the other hand, recommendation utility includes other key dimensions and concerns beyond accuracy, such as novelty and diversity, user engagement, and business performance. While the need for further extension, formalization, clarification and standardization of evaluation methodologies is recognized in the community, this need is still unmet for a large extent. The RUE 2012 workshop sought to identify and better understand the current gaps in recommender system evaluation methodologies, help lay directions for progress in addressing them, and contribute to the consolidation and convergence of experimental methods and practice.},

 abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 7th ACM Recommender Systems Conference (ACM RecSys 2013), held in Hong Kong on October 12-16. As RecSys enters the second half of its first decade, it has clearly established itself as the premier international venue for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from around the world meet and discuss their latest results and solutions. The growing prestige of the conference is reflected by the significant increase in the number of papers that were submitted to the technical program. The overall number of paper submissions went up 20% as compared to last year, with a total of 222 submissions. We received 136 full paper submissions, from which 32 were accepted (23.5%) for oral presentation and 18 were accepted as short papers and poster presentations. We received 80 short paper submissions, from which 24 were accepted (28.75%). Seven of these short papers were selected for short oral presentation and the remaining for poster presentation. For the first time this year, in addition to full and short papers, we also had a new category of submissions consisting of full-length industry papers. We received six papers in this category, out of which two papers were accepted and were presented during the industrial research session. To accommodate the large number of high-quality papers that we received and accepted, the number of research sessions has been increased to eight from the previous year's five sessions. Besides the technical program, the conference's overall program also includes tutorials, workshops, a doctoral symposium, and demonstrations. The tutorial program includes four exciting tutorials covering state-of-the-art methods for building recommender systems and emerging application areas. The workshop program includes eight different one-day workshops that take place the two days prior to the main conference. The doctoral symposium showcases the work of six PhD students, whose work has been selected after a rigorous review process. Finally, the demonstration program contains five different demonstrations covering various aspects of recommender systems. The conference program also includes three keynotes, one from an academic perspective by Oren Etzioni (University of Washington) and two from an industrial perspective by Dou Shen (Baidu) and Mu Yan (Beihe). Finally, continuing with the tradition of the conference, there is a strong integration of the research with its commercial applications. This is reflected through the strong participation of industry at the workshops, demonstrations, and technical program, as well as a special industrial session containing presentations of the accepted industry papers, invited talks, and panel discussions.},

@inproceedings{Takacs:2012:ALS:2365952.2365972,
 abstract = {Two flavors of the recommendation problem are the explicit and the implicit feedback settings. In the explicit feedback case, users rate items and the user-item preference relationship can be modelled on the basis of the ratings. In the harder but more common implicit feedback case, the system has to infer user preferences from indirect information: presence or absence of events, such as a user viewed an item. One approach for handling implicit feedback is to minimize a ranking objective function instead of the conventional prediction mean squared error. The naive minimization of a ranking objective function is typically expensive. This difficulty is usually overcome by a trade-off: sacrificing the accuracy to some extent for computational efficiency by sampling the objective function. In this paper, we present a computationally effective approach for the direct minimization of a ranking objective function, without sampling. We demonstrate by experiments on the Y!Music and Netflix data sets that the proposed method outperforms other implicit feedback recommenders in many cases in terms of the ErrorRate, ARP and Recall evaluation metrics.},

However, this is not always true due to several reasons including the presence of opinion spam in product reviews. In this paper, the possibility of performing collaborative filtering while attaching weights or quality scores to the ratings is explored. The quality scores, which are determined from the corresponding review data are used to "up-weight" or "down-weight" the importance given to the individual rating while performing collaborative filtering, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions. First, the measure used to capture the quality of the ratings is described. Different approaches for estimating the quality score based on the available review information are examined. Subsequently, a mathematical formulation to incorporate quality scores as weights for the ratings in the basic PMF framework is derived. Experimental evaluation on two product categories of a benchmark data set from Amazon.com demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.},

Our approach, which is well-founded in a Particle Swarm Optimization framework, learns a ranking function by optimizing the combination of unique characteristics (i.e., features) of users, items and their interactions. In particular, we build feature vectors from a factorization of the user-item interaction matrix, and directly optimize Mean Average Precision metric in order to learn a linear ranking model for personalized recommendations.

 abstract = {One of the unresolved issues when designing a recommender system is the number of ratings -- i.e., the profile length -- that should be collected from a new user before providing recommendations. A design tension exists, induced by two conflicting requirements. On the one hand, the system must collect "enough"ratings from the user in order to learn her/his preferences and improve the accuracy of recommendations. On the other hand, gathering more ratings adds a burden on the user, which may negatively affect the user experience. Our research investigates the effects of profile length from both a subjective (user-centric) point of view and an objective (accuracy-based) perspective. We carried on an offline simulation with three algorithms, and a set of online experiments involving overall 960 users and four recommender algorithms, to measure which of the two contrasting forces influenced by the number of collected ratings -- recommendations relevance and burden of the rating process -- has stronger effects on the perceived quality of the user experience. Moreover, our study identifies the potentially optimal profile length for an explicit, rating based, and human controlled elicitation strategy.},

Visual contextual advertising, a young research area, refers to finding relevant text advertisements for a target image without any textual information (e.g., tags). There are two existing approaches, advertisement search based on image annotation, and more recently, advertisement matching based on feature translation between images and texts. However, the state of the art fails to achieve satisfactory results due to the fact that recommended advertisements are syntactically matched but semantically mismatched. In this paper, we propose a semantic approach to improving the performance of visual contextual advertising. More specifically, we exploit a large high-quality image knowledge base (ImageNet) and a widely-used text knowledge base (Wikipedia) to build a bridge between target images and advertisements. The image-advertisement match is built by mapping images and advertisements into the respective knowledge bases and then finding semantic matches between the two knowledge bases. The experimental results show that semantic match outperforms syntactic match significantly using test images from Flickr. We also show that our approach gives a large improvement of 16.4% on the precision of the top 10 matches over previous work, with more semantically relevant advertisements recommended.},

Today, it is important to analyze large collections of user interaction data as a first step in building predictive models for these services as well as learn these models in real-time. One of the biggest challenges in this setting is scale: not only does the sheer scale of data necessitate parallel processing but it also necessitates distributed models; with over 900 million active users at Facebook, any user-specific sets of features in a linear or non-linear model yields models of a size bigger than can be stored in a single system. In this talk, I will give a hands-on introduction to one of the most versatile tools for handling large collections of data with distributed probabilistic models: the sum-product algorithm for approximate message passing in factor graphs. I will discuss the application of this algorithm for the specific case of generalized linear models and outline the challenges of both approximate and distributed message passing including an in-depth discussion of expectation propagation and Map-Reduce.},

 abstract = {Hybrid recommender systems --- systems using multiple algorithms together to improve recommendation quality --- have been well-known for many years and have shown good performance in recent demonstrations such as the NetFlix Prize. Modern hybridization techniques, such as feature-weighted linear stacking, take advantage of the hypothesis that the relative performance of recommenders varies by circumstance and attempt to optimize each item score to maximize the strengths of the component recommenders. Less attention, however, has been paid to understanding what these strengths and failure modes are. Understanding what causes particular recommenders to fail will facilitate better selection of the component recommenders for future hybrid systems and a better understanding of how individual recommender personalities can be harnessed to improve the recommender user experience. We present an analysis of the predictions made by several well-known recommender algorithms on the MovieLens 10M data set, showing that for many cases in which one algorithm fails, there is another that will correctly predict the rating.},

 abstract = {Many recommendation systems rely on explicit ratings provided by their users. Often these ratings are provided long after consuming the item, relying heavily on people's representation of the quality of the item in memory. This paper investigates a psychological process, the "positivity effect", that influences the retrieval of quality judgments from our memory by which pleasant items are being processed and recalled from memory more effectively than unpleasant items. In an offline study on the MovieLens data we used the time between release date and rating date as a proxy for the time between consumption and rating. Ratings for movies tend to increase over time, consistent with the positivity effect. A subsequent online user study used a direct measure of time between rating and consumption, by asking users to rate movies (recently aired on television) and to explicitly report how long ago they watched these movies. In contrast to the offline study we find that ratings tend to decline over time showing reduced accuracy in ratings for items experienced long ago. We discuss the impact these rating dynamics might have on recommender algorithms, especially in cases where a new user has to submit his preferences to a system.},

We frame this technique as a method for neighbour selection, and we show its effectiveness when compared with other cluster-based methods. Furthermore, the performance of our method could be improved if standard similarity metrics -- such as Pearson's correlation -- are also used when predicting the user's preferences.},

 abstract = {Social media sites have used recommender systems to suggest items users might like but are not already familiar with. These items are typically movies, books, pictures, or songs. Here we consider an alternative class of items - pictures posted by design-conscious individuals. We do so in the context of a mobile application in which users find "cool" items in the real world, take pictures of them, and share those pictures online. In this context, temporal dynamics matter, and users would greatly profit from ways of identifying the latest design trends. We propose a new way of recommending trending pictures to users, which unfolds in three steps. First, two types of users are identified - those who are good at uploading trends (trend makers) and those who are experienced in discovering trends (trend spotters). Second, based on what those "special few" have uploaded and rated, trends are identified early on. Third, trends are recommended using existing algorithms. Upon the complete longitudinal dataset of the mobile application, we compare our approach's performance to a traditional recommender system's.},

Past work on Collaborative Filtering (CF) has either not addressed the ranking problem for binary relevance datasets, or not specifically focused on improving top-k recommendations. To solve the problem we propose a new CF approach, Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering (CLiMF). In CLiMF the model parameters are learned by directly maximizing the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which is a well-known information retrieval metric for measuring the performance of top-k recommendations. We achieve linear computational complexity by introducing a lower bound of the smoothed reciprocal rank metric. Experiments on two social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of CLiMF, and show that CLiMF significantly outperforms a naive baseline and two state-of-the-art CF methods.},

Along this line, we present several methods, each of which selects seed items according to different rules.
