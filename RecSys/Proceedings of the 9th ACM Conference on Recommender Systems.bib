 abstract = {Preference-based recommendation systems have transformed how we consume media. By analyzing usage data, these methods uncover our latent preferences for items (such as articles or movies) and form recommendations based on the behavior of others with similar tastes. But traditional preference-based recommendations do not account for the social aspect of consumption, where a trusted friend might point us to an interesting item that does not match our typical preferences. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between preference- and social-based recommendations. We develop social Poisson factorization (SPF), a probabilistic model that incorporates social network information into a traditional factorization method; SPF introduces the social aspect to algorithmic recommendation. We develop a scalable algorithm for analyzing data with SPF, and demonstrate that it outperforms competing methods on six real-world datasets; data sources include a social reader and Etsy.},

As a result, recent developments in recommendation research have increasingly focused towards introducing novelty in user recommendation lists. While, existing solutions aim to find the right balance between the similarity and novelty of the recommended items, they largely ignore the user needs for novelty. In this paper, we show that there are large individual and temporal differences in the users' novelty preferences. We develop a regression model to predict these dynamic novelty preferences of users using features derived from their past interactions. Finally, we describe an adaptive recommender,~\emph{adaNov-R}, that adapts to the user needs for novel items and show that the model achieves better recommendation performance on a metric that considers both novel and familiar items.},

 abstract = {Gravity R&D has been providing recommendation engines as SaaS solutions since 2009. The company has a strong research focus and recommendation quality has always been their primary differentiating factor. Widely used or open source recommendation algorithms are of little use to our technology team as a result of the superiority of our in-house developed, proprietary algorithms. Gravity R&D experienced many challenges while scaling up their services. The sheer quantity of data handled on a daily basis increased exponentially. This presentation will cover how overcoming these challenges permanently shaped our algorithms and system architecture used to generate these recommendations. Serving personalized recommendations requires real-time computation and data access for every single request. To generate responses in real-time, current user inputs have to be compared against their history in order to deliver accurate recommendations. We then combine this user information with specific details about available items as the next step in the recommendation process. It becomes more difficult to provide accurate recommendations as the number of transactions and items increase. It also becomes difficult because this type of analysis requires the combination of multiple heterogeneous algorithms that all require different inputs. Initially, the architecture was designed for MF based models and serving huge numbers of requests but with a limited number of items. Now, Gravity is using MF, neighborhood based models and metadata based models to generate recommendations for millions of items within their databases. This required a shift from a monolithic architecture with in-process caching to a more service oriented architecture with multi-layer caching. As a result of an increase in the number of components and number of clients, managing the infrastructure can be quite difficult. Even with these challenges, we don't believe that it is worthwhile to use a fully distributed system. It adds unneeded complexity, resources, and overhead to the system. We prefer an approach of firstly optimizing current algorithms and architecture and only moving to a distributed system when no other options are left.},

We propose an allocation algorithm that uses a collective measure of price and quality for each ad and factors in slot-specific continuation probabilities to maximize publisher revenue. The algorithm is based on cascade models and uses a dynamic programming method to assign linear (video) ads to slots in an online video. The approach accounts for the negative externality created by lower quality ads placed in a video, leading to viewer exit and thereby preventing the publisher from showing the subsequent ads scheduled in that session. Our algorithm is scalable and suited for real-time applications. A large log of viewer activity from a video ad platform is used to empirically test the algorithm. A series of simulations show that our algorithm, when compared to other algorithms currently practiced in industry, generates more revenue for the publisher and increases viewer retention.},

When they appear in aggregate, these ratings carry social signals such as the direction and strength of the raters' average opinion about the product. Using a controlled experiment we manipulated two central social signals -- the direction and strength of social ratings of five popular consumer products -- and examined their interacting effects on users' ratings. The results show an asymmetric user behavior, where the direction of perceived social rating has a negative effect on users' ratings if the direction of perceived social rating is negative, but no effect if the direction is positive. The strength of perceived social ratings did not have a significant effect on users' ratings. The findings highlight the potential for cascading adverse effects of small number of negative user ratings on subsequent users' opinions.},

 abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) can be vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users who successfully bias recommendations for their own benefit or pleasure. These are known as attacks on RSs and are typically used to either promote ("push") or disparage ("nuke") targeted items contained within the recommender's user-item dataset. Our recent work with the Power User Attack (PUA) model, determined that attackers disguised as influential power users can mount successful (from the attacker's viewpoint) push attacks against user-based, item-based, and SVD-based recommenders. However, the success of push attack vectors may not be symmetric for nuke attacks, which target the opposite effect --- reducing the likelihood that target items appear in users' top-N lists. The asymmetry between push and nuke attacks is highlighted when evaluating these attacks using traditional robustness metrics such as Rank and Prediction Shift. This paper examines the PUA attack model in the context of nuke attacks, in order to investigate the differences between push and nuke attack orientations, as well as how they are evaluated. In this work we show that the PUA is able to mount successful nuke attacks against commonly-used recommender algorithms highlighting the "nuke vs. push" asymmetry in the results.},

This is based on a training objective function where we assume that, for given a user, the recommender system predicts scores for all items that follow approximately a Gaussian distribution. We motivate this assumption from the properties of implicit feedback data. As a model, we use matrix factorization and extend it by non-linear activation functions, as customary in the literature of artificial neural networks. In particular, we use non-linear activation functions derived from our Gaussian assumption. Our preliminary experimental results show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods with respect to optimizing the Area under the ROC curve, while it is particularly effective in optimizing the head of the ranked list.},

Homophily---the tendency for people to associate or interact with similar peers---and social influence---the tendency to adopt certain characteristics of those with whom one interacts---suggest that preferences (e.g., over products, services, political parties) are likely to be correlated among people whom directly interact in a social network. We develop a model, preference-oriented social networks, that captures such correlations of individual preferences, where preferences take the form of rankings over a set of options. We develop probabilistic inference methods for predicting individual preferences given observed social connections and partial observations of the preferences of others in the network. We exploit these predictions in a social choice context to make group decisions or recommendations even when the preferences of some group members are unobserved. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms and the improvements made possible by accounting for social ties.},

 abstract = {Matrix factorization is widely used in Recommender Systems. Although existing popular incremental matrix factorization methods are effectively in reducing time complexity, they simply assume that the similarity between items or users is invariant. For instance, they keep the item feature matrix unchanged and just update the user matrix without re-training the entire model. However, with the new users growing continuously, the fitting error would be accumulated since the extra distribution information of items has not been utilized. In this paper, we present an alternative and reasonable approach, with a relaxed assumption that the similarity between items (users) is relatively stable after updating. Concretely, utilizing the prediction error of the new data as the auxiliary features, our method updates both feature matrices simultaneously, and thus users' preference can be better modeled than merely adjusting one corresponded feature matrix. Besides, our method maintains the feature dimension in a smaller size through taking advantage of matrix sketching. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms the existing incremental matrix factorization methods.},

In recent years, there has been an upsurge of interest in exploiting social information, such as trust and distrust relations in recommendation algorithms. The goal is to improve the quality of suggestions and mitigate the data sparsity and the cold-start users problems in existing systems. In this paper, we introduce a general collaborative social ranking model to rank the latent features of users extracted from rating data based on the social context of users. In contrast to existing social regularization methods, the proposed framework is able to simultaneously leverage trust, distrust, and neutral relations, and has a linear dependency on the social network size. By integrating the ranking based social regularization idea into the matrix factorization algorithm, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm, dubbed PushTrust. Our experiments on the Epinions dataset demonstrate that collaboratively ranking the latent features of users by exploiting trust and distrust relations leads to a substantial increase in performance, and to effectively deal with cold-start users problem.},

Querying participants presents the challenge of which users to probe for updates about a specific situation.

However, there are many recommendation domains and applications where content and metadata play a key role, either in addition to or instead of ratings and implicit usage data. For some domains, such as movies, the relationship between content and usage data has seen thorough investigation already, but for many other domains, such as books, news, scientific articles, and Web pages we still do not know if and how these data sources should be combined to provided the best recommendation performance.

 abstract = {Large scale virtual worlds such as massive multiplayer online games or 3D worlds gained tremendous popularity over the past few years. With the large and ever increasing amount of content available, virtual world users face the information overload problem. To tackle this issue, game-designers usually deploy recommendation services with the aim of making the virtual world a more joyful environment to be connected at. In this context, we present in this paper the results of a project that aims at understanding the mobility patterns of virtual world users in order to derive place recommenders for helping them to explore content more efficiently. Our study focus on the virtual world SecondLife, one of the largest and most prominent in recent years. Since SecondLife is comparable to real-world Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs), i.e., users can both check-in and share visited virtual places, a natural approach is to assume that place recommenders that are known to work well on real-world LBSNs will also work well on SecondLife. We have put this assumption to the test and found out that (i) while collaborative filtering algorithms have compatible performances in both environments, (ii) existing place recommenders based on geographic metadata are not useful in SecondLife.},

 abstract = {Models for recommender systems use latent factors to explain the preferences and behaviors of users with respect to a set of items (e.g., movies, books, academic papers). Typically, the latent factors are assumed to be static and, given these factors, the observed pref- erences and behaviors of users are assumed to be generated without order. These assumptions limit the explorative and predictive capabilities of such models, since users' interests and item popularity may evolve over time. To address this, we propose dPF, a dynamic matrix factorization model based on the recent Poisson factorization model for recommendations. dPF models the time evolving latent factors with a Kalman filter and the actions with Poisson distributions. We derive a scalable variational inference algorithm to infer the latent factors. Finally, we demonstrate dPF on 10 years of user click data from arXiv.org, one of the largest repository of scientific papers and a formidable source of information about the behavior of scientists. Empirically we show performance improvement over both static and, more recently proposed, dynamic recommendation models. We also provide a thorough exploration of the inferred posteriors over the latent variables.},

Fusing geographical and temporal influences for better recommendation accuracy in LBSNs remains unexplored, as far as we know. We depict how matrix factorization can serve POI recommendation, and propose a novel attempt to integrate both geographical and temporal influences into matrix factorization.

 abstract = {As the heterogeneity of data sources are increasing on the web, and due to the sparsity of data in each of these data sources, cross-domain recommendation is becoming an emerging research topic in the recent years. Cross-domain collaborative filtering aims to transfer the user rating pattern from source (auxiliary) domains to a target domain for the purpose of alleviating the sparsity problem and providing better target recommendations. However, the studies so far have either focused on a limited number of domains that are assumed to be related to each other (such as books and movies), or a division of the same dataset (such as movies) into different domains based on an item characteristic (such as genre). In this paper, we study a broad set of domains and their characteristics to understand the factors that affect the success or failure of cross-domain collaborative filtering, the amount of improvement in cross-domain approaches, and the selection of best source domains for a specific target domain. We propose to use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) as a significant major factor in finding the most promising source domains for a target domain, and suggest a cross-domain collaborative filtering based on CCA (CD-CCA) that proves to be successful in using the shared information between domains in the target recommendations.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems help users find items of interest by tailoring their recommendations to users' personal preferences. The utility of an item for a user, however, may vary greatly depending on that user's specific situation or the context in which the item is used. Without considering these changes in preferences, the recommendations may match the general preferences of a user, but they may have small value for the user in his/her current situation. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical hidden Markov model for capturing changes in user's preferences. Using a user's feedback sequence on items, we model the user as a hierarchical hidden Markov process and the current context of the user as a hidden variable in this model. For a given user, our model is used to infer the maximum likelihood sequence of transitions between contextual states and to predict the probability distribution for the context of the next action. The predicted context is then used to generate recommendations. Our evaluation results using Last.fm music playlist data, indicate that this approach achieves significantly better performance in terms of accuracy and diversity compared to baseline methods.},

Relevance-Based Language Models, a principled probabilistic query expansion technique in Information Retrieval, has been recently adapted to the item recommendation task with success. In this paper, we study the effect of the item and user prior probabilities under that framework. We adapt two priors from the document retrieval field and then we propose other two new probabilistic priors. Evidence gathered from experimentation indicates that a linear prior for the neighbour and a probabilistic prior based on Dirichlet smoothing for the items improve the quality of the item recommendation ranking.},

We believe that further insights into such mechanisms can lead to enhanced music recommendations. We research on the exploitation of user-generated data in the context of on-line music services, since it constitutes a rich and increasing source of information of user behavior. The research carried out so far has centered on the scenario of producing a single artist recommendation. Concretely, in this paper we show how to mitigate the cold-start problem for new artists, elaborating on our findings on the combined effect of users' listening histories and users' tagging activity. As future research, we will investigate how improved techniques to exploit user-generated data can also be applied to the task of producing sequential recommendations, like playlists. We are particulary interested in creating music playlists similarly as users would do, and in finding mechanisms to make such music streams adapt to users' feedback on-line.},

A typical example is a single shopping account for the whole family. Traditional recommender systems fail in this situation. If contextual information is available, context aware recommender systems are the state-of-the-art solution. Yet, often no contextual information is available. Therefore, we introduce the challenge of recommending to shared accounts in the absence of contextual information. We propose a solution to this challenge for all cases in which the reference recommender system is an item-based top-N collaborative filtering recommender system, generating recommendations based on binary, positive-only feedback. We experimentally show the advantages of our proposed solution for tackling the problems that arise from the existence of shared accounts on multiple datasets.},

 abstract = {The Web has grown into one of the most important channels to communicate social events nowadays. However, the sheer volume of events available in event-based social networks (EBSNs) often undermines the users' ability to choose the events that best fit their interests. Recommender systems appear as a natural solution for this problem, but differently from classic recommendation scenarios (e.g. movies, books), the event recommendation problem is intrinsically cold-start. Indeed, events published in EBSNs are typically short-lived and, by definition, are always in the future, having little or no trace of historical attendance. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit several contextual signals available from EBSNs. In particular, besides content-based signals based on the events' description and collaborative signals derived from users' RSVPs, we exploit social signals based on group memberships, location signals based on the users' geographical preferences, and temporal signals derived from the users' time preferences. Moreover, we combine the proposed signals for learning to rank events for personalized recommendation. Thorough experiments using a large crawl of Meetup.com demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed contextual learning approach in contrast to state-of-the-art event recommenders from the literature.},

Traditional methods that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. Recent approaches use data from social networks to improve accuracy. However, most of the social-network based recommender systems only consider direct friendships and they are less effective when the targeted user has few social connections. In this paper, we propose two alternative models that incorporate the overlapping community regularization into the matrix factorization framework. Our empirical study on four real datasets shows that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in both traditional and social-network based recommender systems regarding both cold-start users and normal users.},

While considerable previous research has focused on finding topical experts with broad appeal -- e.g., top Java developers, best lawyers in Texas -- we tackle the problem of personalized expert recommendation, to identify experts who have special personal appeal and importance to users. One of the key insights motivating our approach is to leverage the geo-spatial preferences of users and the variation of these preferences across different regions, topics, and social communities. Through a fine-grained GPS-tagged social media trace, we characterize these geo-spatial preferences for personalized experts, and integrate these preferences into a matrix factorization-based personalized expert recommender. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed approach can improve the quality of recommendation by 24% in precision compared to several baselines. We also find that users' geo-spatial preference of expertise and their underlying social communities can ameliorate the cold start problem by more than 20% in precision and recall.},

As one way of taking advantage of the relative merits of different algorithms, we gave users the ability to change the algorithm providing their movie recommendations and studied how they make use of this power. We conducted our study with the launch of a new version of the MovieLens movie recommender that supports multiple recommender algorithms and allows users to choose the algorithm they want to provide their recommendations. We examine log data from user interactions with this new feature to under-stand whether and how users switch among recommender algorithms, and select a final algorithm to use. We also look at the properties of the algorithms as they were experienced by users and examine their relationships to user behavior. We found that a substantial portion of our user base (25%) used the recommender-switching feature. The majority of users who used the control only switched algorithms a few times, trying a few out and settling down on an algorithm that they would leave alone. The largest number of users prefer a matrix factorization algorithm, followed closely by item-item collaborative filtering; users selected both of these algorithms much more often than they chose a non-personalized mean recommender. The algorithms did produce measurably different recommender lists for the users in the study, but these differences were not directly predictive of user choice.},

In this work we will elaborate on the different challenges faced when creating recommendations in the following domains - Online marketplaces: Two sided marketplaces where buyers and sellers can interact and sell items with each other. - Online News: Online news sites where users consume the latest news articles related to current affairs. - Generic Recommendations: Sites which create generic recommendations based on generalised algorithms. We will review how we address these different challenges in Schibsted. Schibsted is an international media company with over 200 million unique users a month, split across 39 countries across the world. Concretely we will review, and compare the primary challenges between the different domains mentioned as well as the commonalities and general lessons we have learnt. For example in a two sided marketplace, it is important that both actors in the interaction are considered when creating recommendations. Constraints such as price sensitivity and geographical location become important when identifying good quality recommendations for our users. Alternatively, in online news we need to consider issues such as freshness and topical relevance when creating recommendations for users, while also striving to ensure we have editorial satisfaction. Finally we can look to generic recommendation solutions where we provide simple recommendation API end points. In this case it is important to ensure good quality recommendations while ensuring a generic enough solution that it can be used in many different scenarios. What makes these challenges particularly interesting is that we approach these different challenges with a holistic view of for improving the overall user experience for our users in Schibsted.},

 abstract = {The expansion of TV services such as DVR and, more recently, Catch-up have removed the temporal constraint typical of the Linear "appointment" TV enabling users to watch content they love at any time and on-demand. However, the DVR and Catch-up TV libraries, while providing a convenient time-shifted "on-demand" consumption, are indeed composed by content recently aired on a linear channel, so that they have more in common with Linear TV than they have with VOD. In this talk we will present and discuss the main challenges and some possible solutions to personalize the user experience with content from DVR and Catch-up TV, such as: (i) The consumption pattern is strongly affected by the context (e.g., time and device used to access the video service). (ii) Some content is consumed serially and still follows seasonal dynamics (e.g., TV Series). (iii) The system is fed with a massive and very dynamic streams of data (e.g., new content arriving right after broadcast, signals of user interactions). (iv) The same piece of content may coexist across multiple services provided by the same operator (e.g., linear schedule, network-DVR, catch-up TV, subscription VOD, rental VOD).},

 abstract = {Recent work has shown that collaborative filter-based recommender systems can be improved by incorporating side information, such as natural language reviews, as a way of regularizing the derived product representations. Motivated by the success of this approach, we introduce two different models of reviews and study their effect on collaborative filtering performance. While the previous state-of-the-art approach is based on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model of reviews, the models we explore are neural network based: a bag-of-words product-of-experts model and a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate that the increased flexibility offered by the product-of-experts model allowed it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Amazon review dataset, outperforming the LDA-based approach. However, interestingly, the greater modeling power offered by the recurrent neural network appears to undermine the model's ability to act as a regularizer of the product representations.},

 abstract = {The essence of a recommender system is that it can recommend items personalized to the preferences of an individual user. But typically users are given no explicit control over this personalization, and are instead left guessing about how their actions affect the resulting recommendations. We hypothesize that any recommender algorithm will better fit some users' expectations than others, leaving opportunities for improvement. To address this challenge, we study a recommender that puts some control in the hands of users. Specifically, we build and evaluate a system that incorporates user-tuned popularity and recency modifiers, allowing users to express concepts like "show more popular items". We find that users who are given these controls evaluate the resulting recommendations much more positively. Further, we find that users diverge in their preferred settings, confirming the importance of giving control to users.},

Relying solely on long-term user models that are pre-trained on historical data can therefore be insufficient for a suitable next-basket recommendation. Simple "real-time" recommendation approaches based, e.g., on unpersonalized co-occurrence patterns, on the other hand do not fully exploit the available information about the user's long-term preference profile. In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the effectiveness of using and combining long-term models and short-term adaptation strategies. We conducted an empirical evaluation based on a novel evaluation design and two real-world datasets. The results indicate that maintaining short-term content-based and recency-based profiles of the visitors can lead to significant accuracy increases. At the same time, the experiments show that the choice of the algorithm for learning the long-term preferences is particularly important at the beginning of new shopping sessions.},

@inproceedings{Barjasteh:2015:CIU:2792838.2800196,
 abstract = {A major challenge in collaborative filtering based recommender systems is how to provide recommendations when rating data is sparse or entirely missing for a subset of users or items, commonly known as the cold-start problem. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing new solutions that address the cold-start problem. These solutions are mainly based on the idea of exploiting other sources of information to compensate for the lack of rating data. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework based on matrix factorization that simultaneously exploits the similarity information among users and items to alleviate the cold-start problem. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed algorithm decouples the following two aspects of the cold-start problem: (a) the completion of a rating sub-matrix, which is generated by excluding cold-start users and items from the original rating matrix; and (b) the transduction of knowledge from existing ratings to cold-start items/users using side information. This crucial difference significantly boosts the performance when appropriate side information is incorporated. We provide theoretical guarantees on the estimation error of the proposed two-stage algorithm based on the richness of similarity information in capturing the rating data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that addresses the cold-start problem with provable guarantees. We also conduct thorough experiments on synthetic and real datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and highlights the usefulness of auxiliary information in dealing with both cold-start users and items.},

 abstract = {Most existing e-commerce recommender systems aim to recommend the right products to a consumer, assuming the properties of each product are fixed. However, some properties, including price discount, can be personalized to respond to each consumer's preference. This paper studies how to automatically set the price discount when recommending a product, in light of the fact that the price will often alter a consumer's purchase decision. The key to optimizing the discount is to predict consumer's willingness-to-pay (WTP), namely, the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a product. Purchase data used by traditional e-commerce recommender systems provide points below or above the decision boundary. In this paper we collected training data to better predict the decision boundary. We implement a new e-commerce mechanism adapted from laboratory lottery and auction experiments that elicit a rational customer's exact WTP for a small subset of products, and use a machine learning algorithm to predict the customer's WTP for other products. The mechanism is implemented on our own e-commerce website that leverages Amazon's data and subjects recruited via Mechanical Turk. The experimental results suggest that this approach can help predict WTP, and boost consumer satisfaction as well as seller profit.},

These systems strive to optimize the match between recommended items and users' preferences. We assume that recommendations might be reflected with low accuracy not only due to the recommended items' suitability to the user, but also because of the recommendations' timings. We therefore claim that it is possible to learn a model of good and bad contexts for recommendations that can later be integrated in a recommender system. Using mobile data collected during a three week user study, we suggest a two-phase model that is able to classify whether a certain context is at all suitable for any recommendation, regardless of its content. Results reveal that a hybrid model that first decides whether it should use a personal or a non-personal timing model, and then classifies accordingly whether the timing is proper for recommendations, is superior to both the personal or non-personal timing models.},

 abstract = {Philosophers of language have taught us that at the basis of language production there is the intention to change the state of the world by intervening linguistically on other agents. Persuasion, being the process of influencing attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, mood of a target, is a matter of stronger emphasis. Argumentation is just one resource to persuasion; it has been studied since the times of Aristotle and now for quite some time in artificial intelligence. The peripheral route to persuasion [1] is a different modality, one that is based on indirect, evocative, aesthetic aspects of the message. Automated intelligent persuasion of this sort (and also defense from inappropriate persuasion) is a research area close to producing usable results, both through creative production of language expressions, and through other forms of communication. The traditional goal of human-oriented information technology is mostly to offer services. With intelligent persuasive interfaces, instead, the overall goal is to produce an effect on humans, to influence their beliefs, their attitudes and eventually their actions and overall behavior. The area of intelligent persuasion has the potential to change the picture radically in the world of advertising and of social influencing. Computer-based systems can be flexible, and starting from goals they have to pursue, they can take into account the situation and the specific target, adapt the messages in appropriate ways and assess the outcome. In addition, the availability of very large amounts of data which can be exploited also in real time provides unprecedented possibilities. It is easy now to predict the following developments for the advertising sector: reduction in time to market and extension of possible occasions for advertisement; overall reduction of off target messages, eliminating the less relevant for the individual in a given situation; more attention to the wearing out of the message and to the need for planning variants and connected messages across time and space; contextual personalization, on the basis of audience profile and dynamic model (emotional state, beliefs, goals, etc.) and situational information; interactivity; audience reaction monitoring and system feedback on message effectiveness. In the Per Te project we have explored several areas concerned with intelligent persuasion. One topic is concerned with getting the attention and evoking a desired concept by means of original linguistic expressions. A main theme is the automatic production of flexible creative messages [2]. The approach is based on developing specific techniques, mostly corpus based, for producing variations of given expressions [3]. Another theme is concerned with ambient intelligence and peripheral displays. A novel technology is able to indirectly but purposefully impact on the behavior of a co-located group of people. Continuous recognition of each individual's focus of attention and activity is used to drive a tabletop interface aimed at facilitating group interaction during a brainstorming-style activity [4}. We believe one of the ultimate criteria for interactive systems' acceptability is going to be the moral implications of their actions. Persuasion is a sensitive topic and we believe ethics has to be studied from now, in view of granting systems will be accepted by users. We have conducted experiments based on the approach of moral dilemmas, so to understand what persuasion means are acceptable in stressed contexts [5]. In conclusion the potential of intelligent persuasion systems is great, not only for commercial applications but also with a societal view: for influencing social attitudes of people and leading to better social behavior.},

In this paper, we show how a recently introduced statistical relational learning framework can be used to develop a generic and extensible hybrid recommender system. Our hybrid approach, HyPER (HYbrid Probabilistic Extensible Recommender), incorporates and reasons over a wide range of information sources. Such sources include multiple user-user and item-item similarity measures, content, and social information. HyPER automatically learns to balance these different information signals when making predictions. We build our system using a powerful and intuitive probabilistic programming language called probabilistic soft logic, which enables efficient and accurate prediction by formulating our custom recommender systems with a scalable class of graphical models known as hinge-loss Markov random fields. We experimentally evaluate our approach on two popular recommendation datasets, showing that HyPER can effectively combine multiple information types for improved performance, and can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems are routinely equipped with standardized taxonomy that associates each item with one or more categories or genres. Although such information does not directly imply the quality of an item, the distribution of ratings vary greatly across categories, e.g. animation movies may generally receive higher ratings than action movies. While it is a natural outcome given the diversity and heterogeneity of both users and items, it makes directly aggregated ratings, which are commonly used to guide users' choice by reflecting the overall quality of an item, incomparable across categories and hence prone to fairness and diversity issues. This paper aims to uncover and calibrate systematic category-wise biases for discrete-valued ratings. We propose a novel Bayesian multiplicative probit model that treats the inflation or deflation of mean rating for a combination of categories as multiplicatively contributed from category-specific parameters. The posterior distribution of those parameters, as inferred from data, can capture the bias for all possible combinations of categories, thus enabling statistically efficient estimation and principled rating calibration.},

 abstract = {The item cold-start problem is of a great importance in collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation systems. It arises when new items are added to the inventory and the system cannot model them properly since it relies solely on historical users' interactions (e.g., ratings). Much work has been devoted to mitigate this problem mostly by employing hybrid approaches that combine content-based recommendation techniques or by devoting a portion of the user traffic for exploration to gather interactions from random users. We focus on pure CF recommender systems (i.e., without content or context information) in a realistic online setting, where random exploration is inefficient and smart exploration that carefully selects users is crucial due to the huge flux of new items with short lifespan. We further assume that users arrive randomly one after the other and that the system has to immediately decide whether the arriving user will participate in the exploration of the new items. For this setting we present ExcUseMe, a smart exploration algorithm that selects a predefined number of users for exploring new items. ExcUseMe gradually excavates the users that are more likely to be interested in the new items and models the new items based on the users' interactions. We evaluated ExcUseMe on several datasets and scenarios and compared it to state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results indicate that ExcUseMe is an efficient algorithm that outperforms all other algorithms in all tested scenarios.},

 abstract = {Traditional recommendation systems use multiple computational techniques to perform personalized recommendations, and can consider the interests of users and even the context in which they live. However, they usually ignore each individual's personality factors, and hence, the recommendations generated overwhelmingly consider that all the users are identical psychologically. They ignore, for example, the curiosity level of each user, which may indicate that individuals with a high level of curiosity seek visit exotic locations and/or not yet visited by them, or even individuals with a low curiosity level tend to do the same things they did in the past, uninterested in new or different areas. Our paper presents a complete hybrid recommendation system considering the curiosity level of each individual as a decisive factor to recommend sites of South America. In order to prove the efficiency of our system in contrast to traditional recommendation systems, as well as to measure the satisfaction of users about the recommendations, we performed some preliminary experiments with the participation of 105 Brazilian volunteers. The first results indicate that considering the level of curiosity of a user increases the satisfaction with the recommendations.},

With this motivation, this paper presents results of a study where we focused on understanding (i) "when" to use the temporal information into traditional collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms, and (ii) "how" to weight the similarity between users and items by exploring the effect of different time-decay functions. As the results of our extensive evaluation conducted over five social tagging systems (Delicious, BibSonomy, CiteULike, MovieLens, and Last.fm) suggest, the step (when) in which time is incorporated in the CF algorithm has substantial effect on accuracy, and the type of time-decay function (how) plays a role on accuracy and coverage mostly under pre-filtering on user-based CF, while item-based shows stronger stability over the experimental conditions.},

 abstract = {The emergence of smart mobile devices has given rise to the development of context-aware systems that utilize sensors to collect available data about users. This data, in turn, is used in order to improve various services for the user. The development of such applications is inherently complex, since these applications adapt to changing context information, such as: physical context, computational context, and user tasks. Context information is gathered from a variety of sources that differ in the quality of information they produce and that are often failure-prone. Our study is part of a growing research effort that examines how data collected from mobile devices can be utilized to infer users' behavior and environment. We propose novel approaches that use a rich set of mobile sensors in order to infer unexplored users' contexts in personal models. We also suggest utilizing these high dimensional sensors, which represent users' context for a CARS (context-aware recommender system). For this purpose, we suggest several methods for reducing the dimensionality space by extracting latent contexts from data collected by mobile device sensors. Latent contexts are hidden context patterns, modeled as numeric vectors that are learned for each user automatically, by utilizing unsupervised deep learning techniques on the collected data. We also describe a novel latent context recommendation technique that uses latent contexts and improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art CARS. A preliminary analysis reveals encouraging insights regarding the feasibility of latent contexts and their utilization for context-aware recommendation systems.},

 abstract = {Business-oriented social networks like LinkedIn or XING support people in discovering career opportunities. In this talk, we will focus on the problem of recommending job offers to Millions of XING users. We will discuss challenges of building a job recommendation system that has to satisfy the demands of both job seekers who have certain wishes concerning their next career step and recruiters who aim to hire the most appropriate candidate for a job. Based on insights gained from a large-scale analysis of usage data and profile data such as curriculum vitae, we will study features of the recommendation algorithms that aim to solve the problem. Job advertisements typically describe the job role that the candidate will need to fill, required skills, the expected educational background that candidates should have and the company and environment in which candidates will be working. Users of professional social networks curate their profile and curriculum vitae in which they describe their skills, interests and previous career steps. Recommending jobs to users is however a non-trivial task for which pure content-based features that would just match the aforementioned properties are not sufficient. For example, we often observe that there is a gap between what people specify in their profiles and what they are actually interested in. Moreover, profile and CV typically describe the past and current situation of a user but do not reflect enough the actual demands that users have with respect to their next career step. Therefore, it is crucial to also analyze the behavior of the users and exploit interaction data such as search queries, clicks on jobs, bookmarks, clicks that similar users performed, etc. Our job recommendation system exploits various features in order to estimate whether a job posting is relevant for a user or not. Some of these features rather reflect social aspects (e.g. does the user have contacts that are living in the city in which the job is offered?) while others capture to what extent the user fulfills the requirements of the role that is described in the job advertisement (e.g. similarity of user's skills and required skills). To better understand appropriate next career steps, we mine the CVs of the users and learn association rules that describe the typical career paths. This information is also made publicly available via FutureMe - a tool that allows people to explore possible career opportunities and identify professions that may be interesting for them to work in. One of the challenges when developing the job recommendation system is to collect explicit feedback and thus understanding (i) whether a recommended job was relevant for a user and (ii) whether the user was a good candidate for the job. We thus started to stronger involve users in providing feedback and build a feedback cycle that allows the recommender system to automatically adapt to the feedback that the crowd of users is providing. By displaying explanations about why certain items were suggested, we furthermore aim to increase transparency of how the recommender system works.},

 abstract = {With the increasing accessibility of transactional data in venture finance, venture capital firms (VCs) face great challenges in developing quantitative tools to identify new investment opportunities. Recommendation techniques have the possibility of helping VCs making data-driven investment decisions by providing an automatic screening process of a large number of startups across different domains on the basis of their past investment data. A previous study has shown the potential advantage of using collaborative filtering to catch and predict the VCs' investment behaviours. However, two fundamental challenges in venture finance make conventional recommendation techniques difficult to apply. First, risk factors should be cautiously considered when making investments: for a potential startup, a VC needs to specifically estimate how well this new investment can fit into its holding investment portfolio in such a way that investment risk can be hedged. Second, The investment behaviours are much sparser than conventional recommendation applications and a VC's investments are usually limited to a few industry categories, making it impossible to use a topic-diversification method to hedge the risk. In this paper, we solve the startup recommendation problem from a risk management perspective. We propose 5 risk-aware startup selection and ranking algorithms to catch the VCs' investment behaviours and predict their new investments. Apart from the contribution on the new risk-aware recommendation model, our experiments on the collected CrunchBase dataset show significant performance improvements over strong baselines.},

The RecSys conference series has clearly established itself as the premier international forum for research and development in the field of Recommender Systems, where leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry meet to share their challenges, solutions, research results, and experiences in the field. The maturity of the conference is clearly demonstrated by the high quality of the submitted research work. This year RecSys received again clearly more than 200 submissions (131 long papers and 84 short papers) and the review process was extremely selective. The Program Committee worked very hard to ensure that every paper got at least three careful and fair reviews and one metareview. All papers, particularly those at the borderline, were also reviewed and thoroughly discussed by a Senior Program Committee member and by the PC Chairs. This process finally led to the acceptance of 28 long papers for oral presentation (acceptance rate 21.4%) and 22 short papers for poster presentation (acceptance rate 26.2%). We are therefore extremely grateful to our 131 Program Committee members (34 senior and 97 regular) and to our 57 additional reviewers for producing more than 875 detailed and insightful reviews and metareviews. Furthermore, we would like to particularly thank those Senior Program Committee members, who assisted the program chairs in identifying those distinguished papers who received awards. Besides the technical paper program consisting of oral presentations and a poster and demo session, the core conference program also includes two keynote speakers, two industry sessions and a panel discussion. In order to accommodate the program in a two and a half day format technical papers are presented in two parallel tracks for the first time in this conference series. In addition the conference includes four tutorials and a challenge as a pre-conference program and nine workshops as well as a doctoral symposium as post-conference events.},

 abstract = {Automated playlist generation is a special form of music recommendation and a common feature of digital music playing applications. A particular challenge of the task is that the recommended items should not only match the general listener's preference but should also be coherent with the most recently played tracks. In this work, we propose a novel algorithmic approach and optimization scheme to generate playlist continuations that address these requirements. In our approach, we first use collections of shared music playlists, music metadata, and user preferences to select suitable tracks with high accuracy. Next, we apply a generic re-ranking optimization scheme to generate playlist continuations that match the characteristics of the last played tracks. An empirical evaluation on three collections of shared playlists shows that the combination of different input signals helps to achieve high accuracy during track selection and that the re-ranking technique can both help to balance different quality optimization goals and to further increase accuracy.},

 abstract = {For recommender systems, time is often an important source of information but it is also a complex dimension to apprehend. We propose here to learn item and user representations such that any timely ordered sequence of items selected by a user will be represented as a trajectory of the user in a representation space. This allows us to rank new items for this user. We then enrich the item and user representations in order to perform rating prediction using a classical matrix factorization scheme. We demonstrate the interest of our approach regarding both item ranking and rating prediction on a series of classical benchmarks.},

With each domain come new constraints that require system designers to make choices about how to apply and extend generic algorithms in their context. Booking.com is planet earth's number one accommodation reservation site. The accommodation recommendation problem that it needs to solve has several interesting and unique challenges that make that a straightforward matrix factorization or a basic bi-linear model are not sufficient to provide the required predictions. In this talk, we will discuss several of the challenges we have encountered and solutions we have developed.},

 abstract = {We studied an alternative choice-based interface for preference elicitation during the cold start phase and compared it directly with a standard rating-based interface. In this alternative interface users started from a diverse set covering all movies and iteratively narrowed down through a matrix factorization latent feature space to smaller sets of items based on their choices. The results show that compared to a rating-based interface, the choice-based interface requires less effort and results in more satisfying recommendations, showing that it might be a promising candidate for alleviating the cold start problem of new users.},

@inproceedings{Bansal:2015:CDU:2792838.2800186,
 abstract = {We consider the problem of recommending comment-worthy articles such as news and blog-posts. An article is defined to be comment-worthy for a particular user if that user is interested to leave a comment on it. We note that recommending comment-worthy articles calls for elicitation of commenting-interests of the user from the content of both the articles and the past comments made by users. We thus propose to develop content-driven user profiles to elicit these latent interests of users in commenting and use them to recommend articles for future commenting. The difficulty of modeling comment content and the varied nature of users' commenting interests make the problem technically challenging. The problem of recommending comment-worthy articles is resolved by leveraging article and comment content through topic modeling and the co-commenting pattern of users through collaborative filtering, combined within a novel hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. Our solution, Collaborative Correspondence Topic Models (CCTM), generates user profiles which are leveraged to provide a personalized ranking of comment-worthy articles for each user. Through these content-driven user profiles, CCTM effectively handle the ubiquitous problem of cold-start without relying on additional meta-data. The inference problem for the model is intractable with no off-the-shelf solution and we develop an efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithm. CCTM is evaluated on three real world data-sets, crawled from two blogs, ArsTechnica (AT) Gadgets (102,087 comments) and AT-Science (71,640 comments), and a news site, DailyMail (33,500 comments). We show average improvement of 14% (warm-start) and 18% (cold-start) in AUC, and 80% (warm-start) and 250% (cold-start) in Hit-Rank@5, over state of the art.},
